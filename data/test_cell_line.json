However, many ovarian cancers become refractory to treatment with platinum-based compounds. To improve the existing therapies for ovarian cancer, we sought to identify potent, nontoxic and specific drug candidates that have anti-neoplastic effects towards cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Using a cell-based screening assay, we evaluated 56 compounds-derived from the Chinese medicinal plant, Phytolaccae, and one phytoaccagenin compound (Hu-17) was selected on the basis of its ability to dramatically decrease the viability of cisplatin-resistant SK-OV-3 cells.Using high-throughtput microarray system, we identified GO terms and pathway signatures enriched in Hu-17 and/or cisplatin treated SK-OV-3 cells.

Fusion of donor mesenchymal stem cells with parenchymal cells of the recipient can occur in the brain, liver, intestine and heart following transplantation. The therapeutic benefit or detriment of resultant hybrids is unknown. Here we sought a global view of phenotypic diversification of mesenchymal stem cell-cardiomyocyte hybrids and associated time course. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we found hybrids consistently increase ribosome components and decrease genes associated with the cell cycle suggesting an increase in protein production and decrease in proliferation to accommodate the fused state. But in the case of most other gene groups, hybrids were individually distinct. In fact, though hybrids can express a transcriptome similar to individual fusion partners, approximately one-third acquired distinct expression profiles in a single day. Some hybrids underwent reprogramming, expressing pluripotency and cardiac precursor genes latent in parental cells and associated with developmental and morphogenic gene groups. Other hybrids expressed genes associated with ontologic cancer sets and two hybrids of separate experimental replicates clustered with breast cancer cells, expressing critical oncogenes and lacking tumor suppressor genes. Rapid transcriptional diversification of this type garners consideration in the context of cellular transplantation to damaged tissues, those with viral infection or other microenvironmental conditions that might promote fusion. Examination was performed using single-cell RNA-seq of five fusion products (BiFC_D1_F1-5, 24 hours) identified using BiFC, twenty-three fusion products (DC_D1_F1-16, 24 hours; DC_D3_F1-7, 72 hours) identified using dual expression of GFP and mCherry, the parental controls, and the population controls (mMSC_PC and HL1cm_PC).

Examination of the intersection of KAP1 and Paupar transcriptional targets showed that Paupar and KAP1 control expression of a shared set of target genes that are enriched for regulators of neuronal function and cell cycle in N2A cells. Furthermore, CHART-seq and ChIP-seq derived Paupar-KAP1 genome-wide co-occupancy maps revealed a 4-fold enrichment of overlap between Paupar and KAP1 bound sequences on chromatin.

Oocyte quality is a well- established determinant of embryonic fate. However, the molecular participants and biological markers that affect and predict adequate embryonic development are largely elusive. We have previously reported that oocyte- directed Connexin 43 (Cx43) depletion leads to embryo implantation defects, although both the morphology of the oocyte and processes presiding embryo implantation appear to undergo normally. In the context of previous data determining Cx43 indispensability to oocyte and embryonic development, we show here that the timing of Cx43 depletion from the oocyte and the ovarian follicle is crucial in determining the severity of subsequent embryonic defects. Specifically, we show that the implantation defects of blastocysts resulting from oocyte- directed Cx43- depleted follicles (depletion occurs at day 3 postnatal), is not due to maternal luteal insufficiency but rather depends solely on the defective blastocysts. Gene expression microarray analysis revealed global defects in the expression of ribosomal proteins, translation initiation factors and other genes associated with cellular biosynthetic and metabolic processes in these defective oocytes and specifically blastocysts. We therefore propose that timely expression of Cx43 in the oocyte and ovarian follicles is a major determinant of oocyte developmental competence, by determining the ability of the resulting blastocyst to facilitate biomass expansion and undergo adequate embryo implantation. To study the effect of CX43 on the transcriptom of the pre implantation stages, we compared CX43 KO oocytes to the WT oocytes in three different stages of the very early development. First comparison MII oocytes, second comparison blastocysts, third comparison implantation site.",

The increased heme biosynthesis long observed in leukemia was previously of unknown significance. Heme, synthesized from porphyrin precursors, plays a central role in oxygen metabolism and mitochondrial function, yet little is known about its role in leukemogenesis. Here we show increased expression of heme biosynthetic genes, including UROD, only in pediatric AML with high MYCN expression. Both high UROD and MYCN expression predict poor overall survival and unfavorable outcomes in adult AML. Murine leukemic progenitors derived from hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) overexpressing a MYCN cDNA (MYCN-HPC) require heme/porphyrin biosynthesis, accompanied by increased oxygen consumption, to fully engage in self-renewal and oncogenic transformation. Blocking heme biosynthesis reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption and markedly suppressed self-renewal. Leukemic progenitors rely on balanced production of heme and heme intermediates, the porphyrins. Porphyrin homeostasis is required because absence of the porphyrin exporter, ABCG2, increased death of leukemic progenitors in vitro and prolonged the survival of mice transplanted with Abcg2-KO MYCN HPCs. Pediatric AML patients with elevated MYCN mRNA display strong activation of TP53 target genes. Abcg2-KO MYCN HPCs were rescued from porphyrin toxicity by p53 loss. This vulnerability was exploited to show that treatment with a porphyrin precursor, coupled with the absence of ABCG2, blocked MYCN-driven leukemogenesis in vivo thereby demonstrating, that porphyrin homeostasis is a pathway crucial to MYCN leukemogenesis.We used microarrays to compare the global transcription profiles of hematopoietic progenitor cells from wild-type and Abcg2-ko mice that after transduction with vector-alone or vector containing MYCN gene.

We reconstituted the ciliated human bronchial epithelium in vitro using primary bronchial epithelial cells to simultaneously monitor the infection-linked global changes in nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and infected host epithelia gene expression by dual RNA-seq. Acquisition of a total of nearly 2,5 billion sequences allowed construction of high-resolution strand-specific transcriptome maps of NTHi during infection of host mucosal surface and monitoring of metabolic as well as stress-induced host-adaptation strategies of this pathogen. As a part of our screening, we identified a global profile of noncoding transcripts that are candidate small RNAs regulated during human host infection in Haemophilus species. Temporal analysis of host mRNA signatures revealed significant dysregulation of target cell cytoskeleton elicited by bacterial infection, with a profound effect on intermediate filament network of bronchial epithelium. Our data provide a robust and comprehensive catalogue of regulatory responses that drive NTHi pathogenesis and gives novel insights into complex crosstalk between the host and the invading pathogen.

Gliomas are aggressive primary brain tumors, presenting surgery limitations due to their highly infiltrative potential. The expression of Angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors in human astrocytomas was previously associated with a poor prognosis. Accordingly, this study was undertaken to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying Ang II actions in gliomas through the transcriptomic analysis of glioma cells exposed to Ang II. C6 glioma cells were treated with Ang II and specific antagonists of AT1 and AT2. Total RNA was isolated at three and six hours intervals and submitted to oligonucleotide microarray protocol. The differentially expressed genes were obtained by paired t-tests with p<0.05 and interpreted using Venn diagrams, functional enrichment and protein interaction network analyses. Validation of microarray results was carried out through qPCR experiments of selected genes. We found a high number of significant genes with low fold changes in gene expression at the time intervals studied. These genes were regulated in a time dependent-manner, with most gene expression changes being exclusive to one of the time intervals evaluated. Our results indicated that blocking AT1 or AT2 changed the expression of genes involved in regulation of transcription, cell cycle, cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, cell adhesion, cell migration, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, protein transport and protein ubiquitination. Additionally, the signaling pathways over-represented by the significant genes were ErbB, mTOR, MAPK, neurotrophin, insulin and Wnt. Finally, interactome analyses revealed hub genes associated with cell proliferation, survival, migration, transport, structural support, neurotrophin pathway, MAPK signaling and Wnt signaling. Taken together, our findings implicate Ang II-transcriptional regulation in glioma progression by means of the modulation of genes participating in protumoral functions. This transcriptome pattern is observed upon Ang II activation of either AT1 or AT2 receptors, thereby highlighting the relevance of both receptor subtypes in glioma progression. Interactome analyses disclosed hub genes regulated by Ang II which may present higher control over their networks. These genes participate in biological functions that could enhance the degree of malignancy in gliomas and thus should be further explored. C6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 Units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded in cell culture dishes and incubated at 37degC/ 5% CO2 until becoming confluent. Then, these cells were pre-treated (30 minutes) with either AT1 receptor antagonist (Losartan: 10-5M) or AT2 receptor antagonist (PD123319: 10-5M) followed by Ang II treatment (10-7 M) according to the treatment scheme: Group 1 - control; Group 2 - cells only treated with Ang II; Group 3 - cells pre-treated (30 minutes) with Losartan and then treated with Ang II; Group 4 - cells pre-treated (30 minutes) with PD123319 and then treated with Ang II. To identify which genes were significantly differentially expressed, paired t-tests (p<0.05) were performed in the following comparisons: Ang II x Control (3h); Ang II x Control (6h); Ang II +Los x Ang II (3h); Ang II +Los x Ang II (6h); Ang II +PD123319 x Ang II (3h); Ang II +PD123319 x Ang II (6h).",

Better understanding the progression of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the developing cerebral cortex is important for modeling neurogenesis and defining the pathogenesis of neuropsychiat-ric disorders. Here we used RNA-sequencing, cell imaging and lineage tracing of mouse and human in vitro NSCs to model the generation of cortical neuronal fates. We show that con-served signaling mechanisms regulate the acute transition from proliferative NSCs to commit-ted glutamatergic excitatory neurons. As human telencephalic NSCs developed from pluripo-tentcy in vitro, they first transitioned through organizer states that spatially pattern the cortex before generating glutamatergic precursor fates. NSCs derived from multiple human pluripotent lines varied in these early states leading differentially to dorsal or ventral telencephalic fates.

To clarify its cellular origin and the mechanisms of tumorigenesis, we used ex vivo approach to create a murine model for Ewing's sarcoma. The osteochondrogenic progenitors derived from the facial zone (FZ) of murine long bones at late gestation were purified by microdissection, introduced with EWS-FLI1 or EWS-ERG retroviruses and transplanted into nude mice. Ewing's sarcoma-like small round cell sarcoma developed at 100% penetrance, whereas tumor induction was less effective when growth place (GP)-derived cells were used. The different response of gene expression to EWS-FLI1 between FZ and GP cells suggests importance of the specific cellular context for EWS-FLI1 to induce Ewing's sarcoma. The Wnt/b-catenin pathway was involved in close relationship to the cellular context, with Dkk2 and Wipf1 as important downstream modulators. Furthermore, gene expression profiling revealed similarity between our models and human Ewing's sarcoma.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) cause apoptosis in lymphoid lineage cells and are therefore widely used in the therapy of lymphoid malignancies. The molecular mechanisms of the anti-leukemic GC effects are, however, poorly understood. We have previously defined a list of GC-regulated candidate genes by Affymetrix-based whole genome comparative expression profiling in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) during systemic GC monotherapy and in experimental systems of GC-induced apoptosis. ZBTB16, a Zink finger and BOZ-domain containing transcriptional repressor, was one of the most promising candidates derived from this screen. To investigate its possible role in GC-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, we performed conditional over-expression experiments in CCRF-CEM childhood ALL cells. Transgenic ZBTB16 alone had no detectable effect on survival, however, it reduced sensitivity to GC-induced apoptosis. This protective effect was not seen when apoptosis was induced by antibodies against Fas/CD95 or 3 different chemotherapeutics. To address the molecular mechanism underlying this protective effect, we performed whole genome expression profiling in cells with conditional ZBTB16 expression. Surprisingly, ZBTB16 induction did not significantly alter the expression profile, however, it interfered with the regulation of several GC response genes. One of them, BCL2L11/Bim, has previously been shown to be responsible for cell death induction in CCRF-CEM cells. Thus, ZBTB16's protective effect can be attributed to interference with transcriptional regulation of apoptotic genes, at least in the investigated model system. To determine ZBTB16 response genes, C7H2-2C8-ZBTB16#19 and #58 cells (expressing ZBTB16 in a doxycycline-dependent manner) were cultured in duplicates in the absence (treatment \"none\") or presence of 400ng/ml doxycycline (treatment \"Dox\") for 2h, 6h or 24h.

Deregulated developmental processes in the cerebellum cause medulloblastoma, the most common malignant tumor of the central nervous system. About 20-30% of cases are caused by mutations increasing the activity of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway, a critical mitogen in cerebellar development. The proto-oncogene Smoothened is a key transducer of the Shh pathway. Activating mutations in Smoothened that lead to constitutive activity of the Shh pathway have been identified in human medulloblastoma. To understand the molecular and cellular effects of Smoothened variants in normal development and medulloblastoma genesis, we generated the SmoA2 transgenic mouse model which expresses the transgene exclusively in granule neuron precursors. In this study, we demonstrate how two point mutations in a single molecule can produce starkly different phenotypes as seen in comparison to our previous model, ND2:SmoA1. The SmoA2 mice have severe aberrations in cerebellar development whereas the SmoA1 mice are largely normal during development. Medulloblastomas in the SmoA2 mice develop in the dysplastic cerebellar milieu. Intriguingly, despite disruptions in the stereotypic organization of the cerebellum, the SmoA2 mice do not exhibit any overt abnormalities in motor coordination. The differences in the global transcriptional profiles downstream of SmoA1 and SmoA2 further demonstrate the distinctiveness of the two oncogenic Smoothened mutations. The SmoA2 model serves as a unique spatiotemporal tool to investigate the functional significance of the reiterative cerebellar circuitry as well as to further understand Shh pathway mechanics in cerebellar development and oncogenesis. We previously generated a SmoA1 transgenic mouse medulloblastoma model, which expresses the SmoA1 transgene driven by the GNP-specific fragment of the promoter of ND2 transcription factor leading to constitutively active Shh signaling exclusively in the cerebellum. In this study, we characterize the ND2:SmoA2 transgenic mouse model with a similarly designed transgene expressing the SmoA2 mutation. To assess transcriptional changes downstream of SmoA1 and SmoA2, we evaluated global gene expression profiles of P5 SmoA1, SmoA2 and Wt age-matched cerebella. We chose this specific developmental stage because (1) the phenotypes of SmoA1 and SmoA2 are robust and distinct at P5; (2) at P5 GNPs undergo proliferation, migration and differentiation and therefore expression profiling could capture key differences in multiple processes. .",

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis, is characterized by chronic relapsing inflammation of the gut. It has been shown that increased proteasomal activity is associated with the expression of immunoproteasomes, which enhances NF-kB activation and thus promotes inflammation in IBD-patients. Here, we investigate whether modulation of the proteasomal activity is a suitable therapeutic approach to limit inflammation in colitis. This concept was tested in two different experimental setups. First, development of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis was tested in lmp7-/--mice, which lack the essential immunoproteasome-subunit LMP7 or in wildtype-mice treated with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Compared to WT mice, lmp7-/- mice revealed significantly attenuated colitis resulting from reduced NF-kB activation in the absence of LMP7. Further, treatment with bortezomib revealed dose-dependent amelioration of DSS-induced inflammation. In both approaches proteasome modulation limited the infiltration of neutrophils, consequently reducing tissue damage. In summary our experiments demonstrate that modulation of the proteasomal activity is effective in attenuating experimental colitis. In particular, our data suggest that the immunoproteasome-subunit LMP7 is a suitable target for the therapy of IBD. Microarray experiments were performed as dual-color hybridizations. To compensate for dye-specific effects, a dye-reversal color-swap was applied.

Background: Resistance to trastuzumab remains a common challenge to HER-2 positive breast cancer. Up until now, the underlying mechanism of trastuzumab resistance is still unclear. tRNA-derived small non-coding RNAs (tDRs), a new class of small non-coding RNA (sncRNAs), have been observed to play an important role in cancer progression. However, the relationship between tDRs and trastuzumab resistance is still unknown.Methods: We detected the levels of tDRs expression in normal breast epithelial cell lines, trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer cell lines using high-throughput sequencing. qRT-PCR was conducted to validate the differentially expressed tDRs in serums from trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant patients. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the power of specific tDRs. Progression-free survival (PFS) was analyzed using Cox-regression. Furthermore, Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analyses indicated the potential mechanism underlying tDR-mediated trastuzumab resistance.Results: Our sequence results showed that tDRs were differentially expressed in the HBL-100, SKBR3, and JIMT-1 cell lines. tDR-1960 and tDR-1969 were found significantly upregulated in trastuzumab-resistant patients compared to sensitive individuals, and the ROC analysis showed that tDR-1960 and tDR-1969 were correlated with trastuzumab resistance. In a multivariate analysis, higher levels of tDR-1960 and tDR-1969 expression were associated with significantly shorter PFS in patients with metastatic HER-2 positive breast cancer. Additionally, the GO analysis indicated that tDR-1960 and tDR-1969 were mainly involved in the cellular response to drug, which may partially explain the molecular mechanism underlying trastuzumab resistance in HER-2 positive breast cancer.Conclusion: we comprehensively analyzed tDRs in trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer. Our results suggest that tDR-1960 and tDR-1969 play important roles in trastuzumab resistance. Patients with high levels of tDR-1960 and tDR-1969 expression benefitted less from trastuzumab-based therapy than those that express lower-levels of these tDRs. tDR-1960 and tDR-1969 may be potential biomarkers and intervention targets in the clinical treatment of trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) survives and multiplies inside human macrophages by subversion of immune mechanisms. Although these immune evasion strategies are well characterised functionally, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that during infection of human whole blood with M. tuberculosis, host gene transcriptional suppression, rather than activation, is the predominant response. Spatial, temporal and functional characterisation of repressed genes revealed their involvement in pathogen sensing and phagocytosis, degradation within the phagolysosome and antigen processing and presentation. To identify mechanisms underlying suppression of multiple immune genes we undertook epigenetic analyses. We identified significantly differentially expressed microRNAs with known targets in suppressed genes. In addition, after searching regions upstream of the start of transcription of suppressed genes for common sequence motifs, we discovered novel enriched composite sequence patterns, which corresponded to Alu repeat elements, transposable elements known to have wide ranging influences on gene expression. Our findings suggest that to survive within infected cells, mycobacteria exploit a complex immune \"molecular off switch\" controlled by both miRNAs and Alu regulatory elements. 2 cohorts of blood samples infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the same with Mycobacterium bovis BCG - Discovery and Validation. Experimental (discovery: n=4 donors; validation: n=6 donors for Mycobacterium tuberculosis), discovery set n=4; validation set n=5 for M. bovis BCG infection experiments).

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which accounts for 90% of all primary livers tumors, is the fourth most common cancer in the world. The development of HCC is a long-term and complex process, and uncovering the molecular mechanisms associated with HCC development is critical for the disease diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. Exploring these mechanisms using human HCC samples is desirable, but frequently impractical, with a number of limitations and shortcomings. The STAMTM (Stelic Institute & Co, Tokyo, Japan) mouse model of NASH-associated liver carcinogenesis is considered a useful and relevant model for investigating the molecular pathogenesis of NASH-derived HCC. This model resembles the human HCC development associated with progression from simple steatosis to NASH, fibrosis, and HCC. In the present study, by using high-throughput whole genome microarrays (SurePrint G3 Mouse Gene Expression v2, 8x60K; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), we examined the transcriptomic profiles in the livers of STAMTM mice at different stages of liver carcinogenesis, including steatosis (6 week time interval), NASH (8 weeks), fibrotic stage (12 weeks), and in full-fledged HCC (20 weeks). The results of microarray analyses showed significant progressive changes in hepatic gene expression during the development of HCC.

N-nitroso compounds (NOCs) can be formed through endogenous nitrosation in the human body and are known to induce micronuclei (MN) formation in vitro. Since lymphocytic MN represent a well-validated biomarker of effect with regard to carcinogenic risk in multiple target organs, establishing a link between NOCs and MN in humans could provide evidence for a carcinogenic risk. Investigating gene expression modulations in relation to NOC exposure could provide further crucial information on underlying molecular mechanisms-of-action. The purpose of this study is therefore to establish the relationship between human NOC exposure under daily life conditions and MN formation in relation to associated transcriptomic changes, using lymphocytes as a surrogate tissue for analyzing carcinogenic events in target organs. We analyzed gene expression levels and MN frequency in lymphocytes from adults participating in a European cohort from the multidisciplinary research project NewGeneris. For assessing exposure to NOCs, urinary samples were analyzed for marker nitrosamines by GC-MS. NOC exposure was subsequently linked to peripheral blood transcriptomics. We found an association between MN frequency and urinary NOCs, indicating that NOC exposure under daily life circumstances may play an important role in human cancer development. Furthermore, we have identified modifications in pathways which indicate a molecular response to NOC-induced genotoxicity. From this, we derived a small group of genes which could be suitable as mechanistic-based transcriptomic biomarkers of NOC exposure-related cancer risk. The modified genetic processes and genes found in this study may be of interest for future investigations into NOC-associated carcinogenicity in humans.

Vestibular schwannoma (VS) growth cause progressive hearing loss, and the standard treatment including surgery and radiotherapy, can further damage the nerve. There is an urgent need to identify an adjunct therapy that, by enhancing the efficacy of radiation, can help lower the radiation dose and preserve hearing. The mechanisms underlying deafness in NF2 are still unclear. One of the major limitations in studying tumor-induced hearing loss is the lack of mouse models that allows hearing test. Here we developed a cerebellopontine angle (CPA) schwannomas model that faithfully recapitulates the tumor-induced hearing loss. Using this model we discovered that cMET blockade by crizotinib (CRZ) enhanced schwannoma radiosensitivity by enhancing DNA damage, and CRZ treatment combined with low-dose radiation was as effective as high-dose radiation. CRZ treatment had no adverse effect on hearing; however, it did not affect tumor-induced hearing loss, presumably because cMET blockade did not change tumor HGF levels. cMET gene knockdown study independently confirmed the role of cMET pathway in mediating the effect of CRZ. Furthermore, we evaluated the translational potential of cMET blockade in human schwannomas. We found that human NF2-associated and sporadic VSs showed significantly elevated HGF expression and cMET activation compared to normal nerves, which correlated with tumor growth and cyst formation. Using organoid brain slice culture, cMET blockade inhibited the growth of patient-derived schwannomas. Our findings provide the rationale and necessary data for the clinical translation of combined cMET blockade with radiation therapy in NF2 patients.We found that human NF2-associated and sporadic VSs showed significantly elevated HGF expression and cMET activation compared to normal nerves, which correlated with tumor growth and cyst formation.

Neuroinflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, are characterized by invasion of the brain by autoreactive T cells. The mechanism for how T cells acquire their encephalitogenic phenotype and trigger disease remains, however, unclear. The existence of lymphatic vessels in the meninges indicates a relevant link between the CNS and peripheral immune system, perhaps affecting autoimmunity. Here we demonstrate that meningeal lymphatics fulfill two critical criteria: they assist in the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid components and enable immune cells to enter draining lymph nodes in a CCR7-dependent manner. Unlike other tissues, meningeal lymphatic endothelial cells do not undergo expansion during inflammation, and they express a unique transcriptional signature. Notably, the ablation of meningeal lymphatics diminishes pathology and reduces the inflammatory response of brain-reactive T cells during an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Our findings demonstrate that meningeal lymphatics govern inflammatory processes and immune surveillance of the CNS and pose a valuable target for therapeutic intervention.

Mammalian cell reprogramming to pluripotency can be achieved by overexpression of a set of defined transcription factors (Yamanaka factors). Various gene products regulate progression of this process. Some small molecule compounds have been identified to influence it through interacting cellular proteins by library screenings. Although such compounds are useful to reveal mechanisms underlying reprogramming as well as enhancing reprogramming efficiency, the screening usually requires huge amount of compounds to be tested to identify an effective one (ex., one effective molecule in several tens of thousands). Here, we show a case report that there are gene products that can affect efficiency of mammalian cell reprogramming in a xeno-species. Thirty genes specific for a bacterium Wolbachia pipientis, as a pilot trial, were forcedly expressed along with Yamanaka factors in mammalian cells. As a result, we found that 8 Wolbachia genes affected the reprogramming efficiency either positively or negatively. This is a surprisingly high probability compared with small molecule compounds reported. Although this study is just a case report, it shows that screenings using genes from a xenospecies can be so effective. In principle, use of genes from a xenospecies could be useful for controls of various cellular states such as induction or maintenance of a cell type of interest and development novel drugs. Our findings suggest that systems using genes from xeno-species can be novel strategies for a wide variety of cellular events possibly with a high hit rate.

The goals of this study were to compare the magnitude of interindividual differences in the severity of liver injury induced by methyl-donor deficiency among individual inbred strains of mice and to investigate the underlying mechanisms associated with the variability. Feeding mice a choline- and folate-deficient diet for 12 wk caused liver injury similar to NAFLD. The magnitude of liver injury varied among the strains, with the order of sensitivity being A/J C57BL/6J C3H/HeJ < 129S1/SvImJ CAST/EiJ < PWK/PhJ < WSB/EiJ. The interstrain variability in severity of NAFLD liver damage was associated with dysregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism, primarily with a down-regulation of the peroxisome proliferator receptor a (PPARa)-regulated lipid catabolic pathway genes. Markers of oxidative stress and oxidative stress-induced DNA damage were also elevated in the livers but were not correlated with severity of liver damage. These findings suggest that the PPARa-regulated metabolism network is one of the key mechanisms determining interstrain susceptibility and severity of NAFLD in mice. Male A/J, C3H/HeJ and WSB/EiJ inbred mice were maintained on either control or choline- and folate-deficient (CFD) diets for 12 weeks. Gene expression profiles in the livers from control mice and mice fed a CFD-diet were investigated.",

Mutations in CHD7, encoding ATP-dependent chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 7, in CHARGE syndrome leads to multiple congenital anomalies including growth retardation, craniofacial malformations and neurological dysfunction. Currently, mechanisms underlying the CNS phenotypes remain poorly understood. Here, we show that Chd7 is a direct transcriptional target of oligodendrogenesis-promoting factors Olig2 and Brg1 and required for proper timing of CNS myelination and remyelination. Genome-occupancy analyses coupled with transcriptome profiling reveal that Chd7 cooperates with Sox10 to target the enhancers of key myelinogenic genes, and identify novel Chd7 target. 4 RNA-Seq samples from P8 spinal cords of Ctrl and Chd7 cKO mice (duplicatess, Ctrl and cKO).",

Gene network analysis aims to understand how large groups of genes coordinate their activity to support complex biological functions. Gene coexpression networks are constructed on the basis of coordinated change in expression levels. However, a majority of genes have multiple versions or isoforms, often with distinct functionality. Gene cosplicing networks aim to capture coordinated changes in either isoform levels or relative ratios for different genes, which in principle could happen even with constant overall expression levels. We developed a method of capturing coordinated changes in isoform production, based on correlated exon inclusion rates. Integrating these correlations transcriptome wide results in a cosplicing network. The genes deemed important in the cosplicing network (hubs) include long many-exon genes with essential neurological functionality and association with autism spectrum disorders. Importantly, the cosplicing patterns are found, albeit with alterations, across species (mouse, macaque and human) and brain regions (striatum and cortex). 60 samples of HSCC animals tested for catalepsy were analyzed: 28 females (13 non-responders, 15 responders), 32 males (17 non-responders, 15 responders).",

Leptospirosis is a re-emerging tropical infectious disease caused by the pathogenic Leptospira spp. The different host innate immune responses were partially related to the different severity of leptospirosis. In this study, we employed transcriptomics and cytokine array to comparatively calculate the responses of murine peritoneal macrophages (MPM) and human peripheral blood monocytes (HBM) to leptospiral infection, and uncover a series of different expression regulations of these two immune cells. The regulation percentages in several biological processes of MPM, such as the antigen process and presentation, the regulation of membrane potential, and the innate immune response, etc., were much greater than those of HBM (>2 folds). In HBM and MPM, the CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator genes were significantly up-regulated, which supported previous results that the caspase-8/3 pathway plays an important role in macrophage apoptosis during leptospiral infection. The key component of complement pathway, C3, was only up-regulated in MPM. Several cytokines (e.g. IL-10, TNF-alpha) were differently expressed at both mRNA and protein level in MPM and HBM. The differences in the transcriptomics and the cytokine expression revealed in this study were partially consistent with the different outcomes of the chronic and acute leptospirosis; thus, these findings facilitated further molecular study on the innate immune response to leptospiral infection. Murine peritoneal macrophages (MPM) and human peripheral blood monocytes (HBM) were infected by pathogenic Leptospira. The host cells were collected at 1h, 2h, and 4h after infection.

This study was undertaken to identify how gene expression of the RT4 bladder papilloma cells respond to extracellular matrics (ECM) Matrigel. Gene expression profile of RT4 cells grown on Plastic was compared with expression profiles of RT4 cells grown on Matriges over 12 hours-9 days timecourse. Total 5881 hypervariable (HV) genes were found to vary significantly over the time points, indicating a response to matrix change. Correlational clustering showed these HV genes fell into distinct families, predominantly genes which became highly expressed on ECM. Another cluster show genes expressed at 12 hours after grown on Matrigel and third cluster show genes whose expression decreased below noise level on Matrigel. This indicate that processes responsible for cell adaptation to ECM happen within first 12 hours and the second cluster form last response of those active processes. Over 1-9 days of cell grows on Matrigel those genes are constantly expressed. Cell signaling and cellular growth and proliferation accounted for major functions for those genes. G-protein signaling, immune response and NF-kB signaling accounted for most dramatically affected canonical pathways. Genes sharing similar ontologies also share several overrepresented transcription regulatory elements confirmed by independent experiment on Panomics platform.Thus, rapid response for ECM orchestrated by several transcription factors was observed. Identified canonical pathways indicate possible targets for manipulating cell phenotype on ECM.Keywords: extracellular matrix, gene expression, RT4, Matrigel, microarray, time course.

    "text": "A Gene Expression Network Model of Type 2 Diabetes Links Cell Cycle. Insulin resistance is necessary but not sufficient for the development of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes results when pancreatic beta-cells fail to compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin production through an expansion of beta-cell mass or increased insulin secretion. Communication between insulin target tissues and beta-cells may initiate this compensatory response. Correlated changes in gene expression between tissues can provide evidence for such intercellular communication. We profiled gene expression in six tissues of mice from an obesity-induced diabetes-resistant and a diabetes-susceptible strain before and after the onset of diabetes. We studied the correlation structure of mRNA abundance and identified 105 co-expression gene modules. We provide an interactive gene network model showing the correlation structure between the expression modules within and among the six tissues. This resource also provides a searchable database of gene expression profiles for all genes in six tissues in lean and obese diabetes-resistant and diabetes-susceptible mice, at 4 and 10 weeks of age. A cell cycle regulatory module in islets predicts diabetes susceptibility. The module predicts islet replication; we found a strong correlation between ^2 H_2 O incorporation into islet DNA /in vivo/ and the expression pattern of the cell cycle module. This pattern is highly correlated with that of several individual genes in insulin target tissues, including IGF2, which has been shown to promote beta-cell proliferation, suggesting that these genes may provide a link between insulin resistance and beta-cell proliferation.Keywords: time course, mouse strain comparison, effect of obesity,. Type 2 diabetes is a disorder that involves an increased demand for insulin brought about by insulin resistance, together with a failure to compensate with sufficient insulin production. Although Insulin resistance occurs in most obese individuals, diabetes is generally forestalled through compensation with increased insulin. This increase in insulin occurs through an expansion of beta-cell mass and/or increased insulin secretion by individual beta-cells. Failure to compensate for insulin resistance leads to type 2 diabetes. One way to understand the pathophysiology of diabetes is to examine the coordinate changes in gene expression that occur in insulin-responsive tissues and pancreatic islets in obese animals that either compensate for insulin resistance or progress to type 2 diabetes. In each case, there are groups of genes that undergo changes in expression in a highly correlated fashion. By identifying groups of correlated transcripts (gene expression modules) during the compensation and development of diabetes, we can gain insight into potential pathways and regulatory networks in obesity-induced diabetes. We study two strains of mice that differ in obesity-induced diabetes susceptibility. In this study, we surveyed gene expression in six tissues of lean and obese C57BL/6 (B6) and BTBR mice aged 4 wks and 10 wks. B6 mice remain essentially non-diabetic at all ages, irrespective of obesity. When obese, BTBR mice become severely diabetic by 10 weeks of age. By analyzing the correlation structure of the genes under three contrast conditions, obesity, strain, and age, we identified gene expression modules associated with the onset of diabetes and provide an interactive co-expression network model of type 2 diabetes. We found a key module that is comprised of cell cycle regulatory genes. In the islet, the expression profile of these transcripts accurately predicts diabetes and is highly correlated with islet cell proliferation.",

Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), defined by lacking the expression of oestrogen receptor-alpha (ERa), progesterone receptor, and HER2, is considered to be one of the most aggressive subtypes of all breast cancers. To elucidate the genomic and molecular aberrations in TNBC, we performed whole exon sequencing (WES) analysis on 36 TNBC, and identified 117 genes that significantly mutated (q < 0.05) in TNBC including MUC4, MUC6, TP53, and PIK3CA. Interestingly, genes associated with chromatin regulators including the subunits of SWI/SNF complex were frequently mutated in 44.7% of the cases. Furthermore, from the aspect of the possible association of epigenetic dysregulation and TNBC carcinogenesis, we focused on epigenome and genetic alterations of SALL3, an intrinsic inhibitor of DNMT3A, and identified the role of its dysfunction on cancer cell growth. Our study suggests that epigenetic aberrations caused by somatic alterations including DNA methylation might be a potential pathogenesis of TNBC in a certain number of cases.

Cell-based therapies for myelin disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and leukodystrophies, require technologies to generate functional oligodendrocyte progenitor cells.

They can be expanded in vitro for at least five passages while retaining the ability to differentiate into induced multiprocessed oligodendrocytes. When transplanted to hypomyelinated mice, iOPCs are capable of ensheathing host axons and generating compact myelinmyelinating axons both in vitro and in vivo. Lineage conversion of somatic cells to expandable iOPCs provides a strategy to study the molecular control of oligodendrocyte lineage identity and may facilitate neurological disease modeling and autologous remyelinating therapies. 6 total samples were analyzed. MEFs were either untreated or infected with inducible lentiviral vectors containing the open reading frames of transcription factors. Samples were compared to bona fide OPCs.",

Tissue composition is a major determinant of phenotypic variation and a key factor influencing disease outcomes. Although scRNA-Seq has emerged as a powerful technique for characterizing cellular heterogeneity, it is currently impractical for large sample cohorts and cannot be applied to fixed specimens collected as part of routine clinical care. To overcome these challenges, we extended Cell type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) into a new platform for in silico cytometry. Our approach enables the simultaneous inference of cell type abundance and cell type-specific gene expression profiles (GEPs) from bulk tissue transcriptomes. The utility of this integrated framework, called CIBERSORTx, is demonstrated in multiple tumor types, including melanoma, where single cell reference profiles are used to dissect primary clinical specimens, revealing cell type-specific signatures of driver mutations and immunotherapy response. We anticipate that digital cytometry will augment single cell profiling efforts, enabling cost-effective, high throughput tissue characterization without the need for antibodies, disaggregation, or viable cells. To evaluate the performance of CIBERSORTx, we profiled the following primary human samples: (i) A scRNA-Seq dataset derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from a patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using droplet-based 10x Chromium v2 assay, and consisting of six major leukocyte subsets (B cells, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, NKT cells, NK cells, and monocytes).

T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are a subset of CD4+ T cells that promote antibody production during vaccination. Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) efficiently prime Tfh cells; however, conclusions regarding the nature of the cDC responsible for instructing Tfh cell differentiation have differed between recent studies. We found that these discrepancies might exist, in part, due to the unusual sites used for immunization in murine models, which differentially bias which DC subsets access antigen. We used intranasal immunization as a physiologically relevant route of exposure that we show delivers antigen to all tissue DC subsets. Using a combination of mice in which the function of individual DC subsets is impaired and different formulations of antigen delivery, we determined that CD11b+ migratory type 2 conventional DCs (cDC2s) are necessary and sufficient for Tfh induction. DC-specific deletion of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor DOCK8 resulted in an isolated loss of CD11b+ cDC2 but not CD103+ cDC1 migration to lung-draining lymph nodes. Impaired cDC2 migration or development in DC-specific Dock8 or Irf4 knockout mice, respectively, led to reduced Tfh cell and antibody development, whereas loss of CD103+ cDC1s in Batf3-/- mice did not. Loss of cDC2-mediated Tfh responses was associated with impaired antibody-mediated protection from live influenza virus challenge. We show that migratory cDC2s uniquely carry antigen into the sub-anatomic regions of the lymph node where Tfh cell priming occurs, the T-B border. This work identifies the DC responsible for Tfh cell-dependent antibody responses, in particular when antigen dose is limiting or is encountered at a mucosal site, which could ultimately inform the formulation and delivery of vaccines.

For the largest class of human tumors, those of epithelial origin, little is known about their initiating genetic hits or cells of origin. Whether tissue stem cells or more committed progenitors are targets for transformation is also uncertain. Experience in hematopoietic malignancies and sarcomas teaches that recurrent chromosomal translocations represent initiating oncogenic events. To develop a system in which epithelial tumorigenesis can be assessed from the initial event to frank malignancy, we have generated mice that conditionally express the Etv6-NTRK3 (EN) fusion oncoprotein, the product of the t(12;15)(p13;q25) translocation characteristic of one form of human breast cancer. Activation of EN expression in mammary tissues by Whey acidic protein (Wap) promoter-driven Cre leads to fully penetrant, multifocal malignant breast cancer with short latency. We provide genetic evidence that committed, bipotent or CD61+ luminal alveolar progenitors, can be targets of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, EN transforms these otherwise transient progenitors through the AP1 complex. Our model supports the existence of an epithelial cell hierarchy in both normal mammary glands and malignancy. To our knowledge, this is the first murine model of human epithelial cancer based on a recurrent chromosomal translocation. Given increasing relevance of chromosomal translocations in epithelial cancers, such mice serve as a paradigm for the study of their genetic pathogenesis and cellular origins, and generation of novel preclinical models.

Inflammation is beneficial when it is part of the innate immune response, but harmful when it occurs in an unregulated, chronic manner. We now report that IkappaB-beta, a member of the classical IkappaB family, serves a dual role of both inhibiting and facilitating the inflammatory response. IkappaB-beta degradation releases NF-kappaB dimers which upregulate proinflammatory target genes such as TNF-alpha. Suprisingly absence of IkappaB-beta results in a dramatic reduction of TNF-alpha in response to LPS even though the activation of NF-kappaB is normal. The inhibition of TNF-alpha mRNA expression can be correlated to the absence of nuclear, hypophosphorylated-IkappaB-beta bound to p65:cRel heterodimers at a specific kappaB site on the TNF-alpha promoter. Therefore IkappaB-beta acts through p65:cRel dimers to maintain prolonged expression of TNF-alpha. As a result, IkappaB-beta knockout mice are resistant to LPS induced septic shock and collagen-induced arthritis, and therefore blocking IkappaB-beta might be a promising new strategy for selectively inhibiting the chronic phase of TNF-alpha producting during the inflammatory response.

We show that the CTL proteome is dominated by metabolic regulators and granzymes and that mTORC1 selectively represses and promotes expression of a protein subset (~10%) including key CTL effector molecules and signaling proteins. mTORC1 also controlled flux through a subset of metabolic pathways rather than acting as an on/off switch for global CTL metabolism. Proteomic data highlighted the potential for mTORC1 negative control of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) production in CTL. Further work revealed that mTORC1 represses PIP3 production and determines the mTORC2 requirement for activation of the serine/threonine kinase AKT. Unbiased proteomic analysis thus provides a comprehensive understanding of CTL identity and mTORC1 control of CTL function.

We show that human mid-gestation c-Kit- lineage-committed amniotic cells (ACs) can be reprogrammed into induced vascular endothelial cells (rAC-VECs). Transient ETV2 expression in ACs generated immature iVECs, while co-expression with FLI1/ERG1 endowed rAC-VECs with a vascular repertoire and morphology matching mature ECs. Brief TGFb-inhibition functionalizes VEGFR2 signaling, augmenting specification of ACs into rAC-VECs.

When adapting to environmental stress, cells attenuate and reprogram their translational output. In part, these altered translation profiles are established through changes in the interactions between RNA-binding proteins and mRNAs. The Ago2/microRNA machinery has been shown to participate in stress-induced translational upregulation of a particular mRNA, CAT-1; however, a detailed, transcriptome-wide understanding of the involvement of Ago2 in the process has been lacking. Here, we profiled the overall changes in Ago2-mRNA interactions upon arsenite stress by CLIP-seq. Ago2 displayed a significant remodeling of its transcript occupancy, with the majority of 3' UTR and CDS sites exhibiting stronger interaction. Interestingly, target sites that were destined for release from Ago2 upon stress were depleted in miRNA complementarity signatures, suggesting an alternative mode of interaction. To compare the changes in Ago2 binding patterns across transcripts with changes in their translational states, we measured mRNA profiles on ribosome/polysome gradients by RNA-seq. Increased Ago2 occupancy correlated with stronger repression of translation for those mRNAs, as evidenced by a shift toward lighter gradient fractions upon stress, while release of Ago2 was associated with the limited number of transcripts that remained translated. Taken together, these data point to a role for Ago2 and the mammalian microRNAs in mediating the translational component of the stress response.

Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) together with polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) belongs to the classic Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). PV and ET can evolve to secondary myelofibrosis (SMF) giving rise to post-PV (PPV) and post-ET (PET) myelofibrosis (MF). PMF and SMF patients are currently managed in the same way and prediction of survival is based on the same prognostic models, even if it has been demonstrated that they can't accurately distinguish different risk categories in SMF. In the last few years interest grew concerning the ability of gene expression profiling (GEP) to provide valuable prognostic information for clinical decision making. To construct a molecular signature that can predict survival according to gene expression we studied GEP of granulocytes from 114 MF patients, including 35 prefibrotic/early PMF (Pre-PMF), 37 overt PMF (Overt-PMF), 26 PET and 16 PPV, using microarray platform. Granulocytes were isolated from 114 MF patients (35 prefibrotic/early PMF, 37 overt PMF, 26 PET and 16 PPV) and total cellular RNA was extracted. GEP was performed using Affymetrix platform and data were processed by means of Partek Genomics Suite Software.",

Here we report an approach that has permitted us to uncover the sites and mechanisms of action of a drug, referred to as SD70, initially identified by phenotypic screening for inhibitors of ligand and genotoxic stress-induced translocations in prostate cancer cells. Based on synthesis of a derivatized form of SD70 that permits its application for a ChIP-seq-like approach, referred to as Drug-seq, we were next able to efficiently map the genome-wide binding locations of this small molecule, revealing that it largely co-localized with androgen receptor (AR) on regulatory enhancers. Based on these observations, we performed the appropriate global analyses to ascertain that SD70 inhibits the androgen-dependent AR program, and prostate cancer cell growth, acting, at least in part, by functionally inhibiting the jumonji (JMJ) domain-containing demethylase, KDM4C. Drug-seq represents a powerful strategy for new drug development by mapping genome-wide location of small molecules, a powerful adjunct to contemporary drug development strategies.

    "text": "Gene expression during neuronal differentiation in two subtypes of SH-SY5Y. Background: SH-SY5Y cells exhibit a neuronal phenotype when treated with all-trans retinoic acid (RA), but the molecular mechanism of activation in the signaling pathway mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is not sufficiently understood. To shed new light on the mechanism, we comprehensively compared the gene expression profiles between SK-N-SH cells and two subtypes of SH-SY5Y cells (SH-SY5Y-A and SH-SY5Y-E), each of which showed a different phenotype during RA-mediated differentiation. Results: SH-SY5Y-A cells differentiated in the presence of RA, whereas RA-treated SH-SY5Y-E cells required additional treatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) for full differentiation. In combination with perturbation using a PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, we identified 386 genes and categorized them into two clusters dependent on the PI3K signaling pathway during RA-mediated differentiation in SH-SY5Y-A cells. Transcriptional regulation of the gene cluster was greatly reduced in SK-N-SH cells or partially impaired in SH-SY5Y-E cells in coincidence with a defect in the neuronal phenotype of these cell lines. Additional stimulation with BDNF induced a set of neural genes which were down-regulated in RA-treated SH-SY5Y-E cells but were abundant in the differentiated SH-SY5Y-A cells. Conclusions: We identified the gene clusters controlled by PI3K- and TRKB-mediated signaling pathways during differentiation in two subtypes of SH-SY5Y cells. TRKB-mediated bypass pathway compensates for the impaired neural functions generated by defects in several signaling pathways including PI3K in SH-SY5Y-E cells. The expression profiling data are useful for further studies to elucidate the signal transduction-transcriptional network including PI3K and/or TRKB.Keywords: Cell type comparison, time course. Human neuroblastomas, SK-N-SH (HTB-11) and SH-SY5Y-A cells (CRL-2266) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). We also obtained SH-SY5Y-E cells (EC94030304) from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC). Tissue culture cells were maintained in D-MEM/F12 1:1 mixture supplemented with 15% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum) and 1% NEAA (Non-essential amino acid) in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37oC. The culture medium was changed twice a week. For the RA-inducible experiment, random culture cells from two clone subtypes of SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH were seeded in laminin coated culture dishes (BioCoat Laminin Cellware; BD Biosciences, Billerica, MA, USA) for 1 day and then transferred to a medium containing 10 mM of RA in the presence or the absence of LY294002 (10mM) for five days. For BDNF-induced sequential differentiation of the SH-SY5Y-E strain, cells were washed with D-MEM/F12 twice after five days in the presence of RA and then incubated with 50 ng/ml of BDNF in D-MEM/F12 without serum for three days.",

Specific recognition and bacterial adhesion to host cells by uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) are the first steps towards infection of epithelial tissue of the human urogenital system. Therefore, targeting of UPEC virulence factors, relevant for adhesion, is a promising approach for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI). A fully characterized plant-derived aqueous extract from the leaves of Orthosiphon stamineus (OWE), a plant traditionally used in clinical practice in Europe and Asia for UTI, has been shown to exert strong antiadhesive effects under in vitro and in vivo conditions. For improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms transcriptome analysis of OWE-treated UPEC strain UTI89 by Illumina sequencing and cross-validation of these data by qPCR indicated significant down-regulation of bacterial adhesins (curli, type 1-, F1C- and P fimbriae) and of the chaperone-mediated protein folding/unfolding and pilus assembly process; in contrast flagellar and motility-related genes were upregulated. We conclude that OWE transforms the sessile lifestyle of bacteria into a motile one and therefore disables bacterial attachment to the host cell. Additionally, the extract inhibited gene expression of multiple iron acquisition systems (Ent, Fep, Feo, Fhu, Chu, Sit, Ybt) concomitant with an upregulated expression of the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) repressor. The present study explains the antiadhesive and antiinfective effect of the plant extract by pinpointing specific biochemical and molecular targets.

Extracellular, cancer-specific methylated DNA has been shown to be a prognostic marker when detected in serum or plasma. In this study we investigated the effect of treating cancer cells with differentially methylated CpG DNA. When breast cancer cell lines were treated with methylated CpG DNA, a consistent upregulation of CHAC1 mRNA expression was observed. CHAC1 was recently described to be a novel component of the unfolded protein response pathway. To elucidate the role of CHAC1 mRNA expression in cancer in more detail, we analyzed expression of this gene in breast (n=107) and ovarian cancer (n=107) and found a strong correlation with tumor differentiation. Poorly differentiated tumors exhibited higher CHAC1 expression levels (p=0.004 for breast and p=0.031 for ovarian cancer). Additionally, hormone receptor (HR)-negative breast cancers (p<0.001) and advanced stage disease ovarian cancers (p=0.026) also demonstrated high CHAC1 mRNA levels. mRNA expression analysis of the two known CHAC1 isoforms showed a strong association of expression above the median with poor outcome in breast cancer patients in a multivariate analysis (isoform a: relative risk (RR) of death 3.2 (95% CI 1.6-6.5; p<0.01); RR of relapse 3.9 (95% CI 1.6-9.8; p<0.01); isoform b: relative risk (RR) of death 3.5 (95% CI 1.6-7.3; p<0.01); RR of relapse 6.6 (95% CI 2.4-18.5; p<0.01)). Univariate analysis in ovarian cancer showed that CHAC1 mRNA expression above the median was associated with a poor relapse free survival (p=0.03). In younger ovarian cancer patients (age < median age), a high CHAC1 mRNA expression was associated with overall survival (p=0.007) and relapse free survival (p=0.015). Finally, we show that downregulation of CHAC1 by small interfering RNA suppressed breast cancer cell migration and proliferation, whereas overexpression resulted in an observed increase in these cellular behaviours. This is the first report demonstrating that a gene (CHAC1) whose expression is triggered by methylated, but not unmethylated DNA, is involved in tumour biology. Human breast cancer cell lines (BT-20, Hs578T) were treated with methylated and unmethylated DNA oligos, and differentially expressed genes were identified between treatments with methylated and un-methylated oligos.",

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory and destructive joint disease, characterized by overexpression of pro-inflammatory/-destructive genes and other activating genes (e.g., proto-oncogenes) in the synovial membrane (SM). The gene expression in disease is often characterized by significant inter-individual variances via specific synchronization/ desynchronization of gene expression. To elucidate the contribution of the variance to the pathogenesis of disease, expression variances were tested in SM samples of RA patients, osteoarthritis (OA) patients, and normal controls (NC).Results. For the comparison between RA and NC, 568 genes with significantly different variances in the 2 groups (p < 0.05; Bonferroni/Holm corrected Brown-Forsythe version of the Levene-Test) were selected. For the comparison between RA and OA, 333 genes were selected. Using the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG), 10 pathways/complexes significantly affected by higher gene expression variances were identified in RA compared to NC, including cytokine - cytokine receptor interactions, the TGF-pathway, and anti-apoptosis.Compared to OA, 3 pathways with significantly higher variances were identified in RA (e.g., B cell receptor signaling, VEGF signaling). Functionally, the majority of the identified pathways is involved in the regulation of inflammation, proliferation, cell survival, and angiogenesis.Conclusion. In RA, a number of disease-relevant or even disease-specific pathways/complexes are characterized by broad intra-group, inter-individual expression variances. This indicates that RA pathogenesis in different individuals may depend to a lesser extent on common alterations of the expression of specific key genes, but on individual-specific alterations of different genes resulting in common disturbances of key pathways. Expression variances were tested in synovial membrane samples of rheumatoid arthritis patients, osteoarthritis patients, and normal controls (see publication for further details). .",

Although skeletal muscle cells can be generated from human iPSCs, transgene-free protocols include only limited options for their purification and expansion. In this study we found that FACS-purified myogenic progenitors generated from healthy controls and Pompe disease iPSCs can be robustly expanded as much as 5 x 1011 fold. At all steps during expansion, cells could be cryopreserved or differentiated into myotubes with a high fusion index. In vitro, cells were amenable to maturation into striated and contractile myofibers. Insertion of the acid alpha glucosidase cDNA into the AAVS1 locus in iPSCs using CRISPR/cas9 prevented glycogen accumulation in myotubes generated from a patient with classic infantile Pompe disease. In vivo, the expression of human-specific nuclear and sarcolemmar antigens indicated that myogenic progenitors engraft into murine muscle to form human myofibers. This protocol is useful for modeling of skeletal muscle disorders and for using patient-derived, gene-corrected cells to develop cell-based strategies. Myogenic progenitors were expanded for ~15 days and harvested either in proliferation conditions or after 4 days of differentiation as described previously (van der Wal et al., 2017b).

This study aimed to establish the expression profile of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) during nerve allotransplantation. Experimental design Male Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice (age, 10-12 weeks; weight, 30-35 g) were purchased from BioLasco (Yi-Lan, Taiwan). The Balb/c mice served as sciatic nerve allograft donors. The C57BL/6 mice were randomized into the group of nerve allograft transplantation with FK506 treatment and the group without FK506 treatment. These species of mice were selected on the basis of disparity at the MHC locus and prior experience with reciprocal rejection of grafts between these murine strains [18]. The mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of an anesthetic cocktail consisting of 0.1 mg/g ketamine and 0.01 mg/g xylazine. The anesthetized mice were restrained in a supine position on a heated pad to maintain the body temperature at 37degC. Under aseptic conditions, with sterile povidone/iodine preparation and 70% ethanol and sterile instruments and drapes, the skin over the proximal right hindlimb was incised, and the underlying biceps femoris muscle was bluntly dissected to expose the sciatic nerve. An established mouse sciatic nerve allotransplantation model was used. In brief, 1-cm Balb/c donor sciatic nerve grafts were transplanted in reverse orientation into 0.5-cm sciatic nerve gaps created in the recipient Balb/c mice. Tension-free repair was then performed under an operating microscope with three 11-0 nylon (Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ) interrupted epineurial sutures under 40X magnification. The muscle was closed with 5-0 vicryl sutures, and the skin with interrupted 5-0 nylon sutures. The animals were monitored to ensure appropriate feeding and diet after surgery. FK506 was administered subcutaneously at 1 mg/(kg-d) throughout the experimental course. At 3, 7, and 14 d after initial surgery (n = 3 animals per group at each time point), the whole blood samples were collected at the indicated times in tubes containing anticoagulant. (F)3d, (F)7d and (F)14d were used to indicate the serum samples of allotransplantation mice with FK506 immunosuppression for 3, 7, and 14 d, respectively. (N)3d, (N)7d and (N)14d were used to indicate the serum samples of allotransplantation mice without FK506 immunosuppression and sacrificed at postoperative 3, 7, and 14 d, respectively. After the whole blood samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 min, they were centrifuged at 3,000 xg for 10 min, white blood cells were slowly removed from the corresponding layers, and the serum was extracted and stored at -80degC before processing for RNA analyses. Small RNA libraries generated from the serum of mice of above groups were analyzed using an Illumina HiSeq2000 Sequencer.",

Arterial smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) undergo phenotypic changes during development and pathological processes in vivo and during cell culture in vitro. Our previous studies demonstrated that retrovirally-mediated expression of the versican V3 splice variant (V3) that lacks glycosaminoglycan chains by ASMCs retards cell proliferation and migration in vitro and reduces neointimal thickening, macrophage and lipid accumulation in animal models of vascular injury and atherosclerosis. However, the molecular pathways induced by V3 expression that are responsible for these changes are not yet clear. In the present study, we employed a microarray approach to examine how expression of V3 induced changes in gene expression and the molecular pathways in ASMCs. We found that forced expression of V3 by ASMCs affected expression of 521 genes by more than 1.5 fold. Gene ontology (GO) analysis shows that components of extracellular matrix were the most significantly affected by V3 expression, indicating that V3 expression elicits profound remodeling of extracellular matrix. In addition, genes regulating the formation of the cytoskeleton which also serve as markers of contractile smooth muscle cells were significantly upregulated. On the other hand, components of the complement system, chemokines, chemokine receptors, and transcription factors crucial for regulating inflammatory processes were among the genes most downregulated. Consistently, we found that the level of myocardin, a key transcription factor promoting contractile ASMC phenotype, was greatly increased while proinflammatory transcription factors NFkappaB1 and C/EBPb were significantly attenuated in V3-expressing SMCs. Such results indicate that V3 expression reprograms ASMC into differentiated and anti-inflammatory phenotypes. Overall, these findings demonstrate that expression of V3 reprograms ASMCs promoting anti-inflammatory and differentiated smooth muscle cell phenotypes potentially by altering cell-ECM interaction and focal adhesion signaling pathways. Fischer rat ASMCs were transduced with either a retroviral vector expressing the Versican V3 splice variant (LV3SN) or an empty control vector (LXSN) in three independent experiments. In the first experiment, V3 and control transductions were performed with four technical replicates. In the subsequent two experiments, individual transductions were done for the V3 or control treatments. For data analysis, the technical replicates from the first experiment were averaged, and then data from the three experiments was evaluated in a paired manner.",

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are the mainstay treatment for the 10-20% of pregnant and postpartum women who suffer major depression, but the effects of SSRIs on their children's developing brain and later emotional health are poorly understood. SSRI use during pregnancy can elicit antidepressant withdrawal in newborns and increase toddlers' anxiety and social avoidance. In rodents, perinatal SSRI exposure increases adult depression- and anxiety-like behavior, although certain individuals are more vulnerable to these effects than others. Our study establishes a rodent model of individual differences in susceptibility to perinatal SSRI exposure, utilizing selectively-bred Low Responder (LR) and High Responder (HR) rats that were previously bred for high versus low behavioral response to novelty. Pregnant HR/LR females were chronically treated with the SSRI paroxetine (10 mg/kg/day p.o.) to examine its effects on offspring's emotional behavior and gene expression in the developing brain. Paroxetine treatment had minimal effect on HR/LR dams' pregnancy outcomes or maternal behavior. We found that LR offspring, naturally prone to an inhibited/anxious temperament, were susceptible to behavioral abnormalities associated with perinatal SSRI exposure (which exacerbated their Forced Swim Test immobility), while high risk-taking HR offspring were resistant. Microarray studies revealed robust perinatal SSRI-induced gene expression changes in the developing LR hippocampus and amygdala (postnatal days 7-21), including transcripts involved in neurogenesis, synaptic vesicle components, and energy metabolism. These results highlight the LR/HR model as a useful tool to explore the neurobiology of individual differences in susceptibility to perinatal SSRI exposure. 78 samples from 2 brain regions (hippocampus and amygdala) across four developmental timepoints (postnatal days (P)7, 14, 21, 75) following perinatal exposure paroxetine (or normal drinking water).",

Genetic perturbations of the transcription factor, Forkhead Box P1 (FOXP1), occur in patients with autism spectrum disorder who have an increased risk for comorbidity with intellectual disability. Recent work has begun to reveal an important role for Foxp1 in brain development, but the brain region-specific contribution of Foxp1 to autism and intellectual disability phenotypes has yet to be fully determined. Here, we characterize Foxp1 conditional knockout (Foxp1cKO) mice with loss of Foxp1 in the pyramidal neurons of the neocortex and the CA1/CA2 subfields of the hippocampus. Foxp1cKO mice exhibit behavioral phenotypes that are relevant to autism spectrum disorder, including hyperactivity, increased anxiety, and decreased sociability. In addition, Foxp1cKO mice have gross deficits in learning and memory tasks that are relevant to intellectual disability. Using a genome-wide approach, we identified genes differentially expressed in the hippocampus of Foxp1cKO mice that are associated with synaptic function and physiology that could represent molecular networks related to the observed behavioral deficits. Finally, we observed reduced maintenance of long-term potentiation in the CA1 subfield of these animals. Together, these data suggest that expression of Foxp1 in pyramidal neurons of the forebrain is important for regulating gene expression pathways that contribute to specific behaviors relevant to autism and intellectual disability. In particular, Foxp1 regulation of gene expression in the hippocampus appears to be crucial for normal CA1 physiology and spatial learning. We carried out RNA-sequencing on adult male mouse hippocampal tissue and neocortical tissue.

Using human, Drosophila, and mouse models, we show that the proteins encoded by SMARCAL1 orthologues localize to transcriptionally active chromatin and modulate gene expression. We also show that similar to SIOD patients, deficiency of the SMARCAL1 orthologues alone is insufficient to cause disease in fruit flies and mice although such deficiency causes modest diffuse alterations in gene expression. Rather, disease manifests when SMARCAL1 deficiency interacts with genetic and environmental factors that further alter gene expression. We conclude that the SMARCAL1 annealing helicase buffers fluctuations in gene expression and that alterations in gene expression contribute to the penetrance of SIOD.

Although substantial progress has been made in the treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), the prognosis of patients with refractory or relapsed B-ALL remains dismal. Novel therapeutic strategies are needed to improve the outcome of these patients. KPT-9274 is a novel dual inhibitor of p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). PAK4 is a serine/threonine kinases and it regulates a variety of protein kinases involved in cell survival, motility and proliferation. NAMPT is a rate-limiting enzyme in the salvage biosynthesis pathway of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), which plays a vital role in energy metabolism. Here, we show that KPT-9274 strongly inhibits B-ALL cell growth regardless of cytogenetic abnormalities. We also demonstrate the potent in vivo efficacy and tolerability of KPT-9274 in orthotopic xenograft murine models using patient-derived BALL cells. Although KPT-9274 affected both PAK4 signaling pathways and NAD+ dependent pathways, B-ALL cell growth inhibition mediated by KPT-9274 was largely abolished by nicotinic acid supplementation, indicating that the inhibitory effect of KPT- 9274 on B-ALL cell growth was mainly exerted by NAD+ depletion through blockade of NAMPT enzyme activity. Moreover, we found that B-ALL cells were especially vulnerable to NAD+ depletion, and the susceptibility to treatment with KPT-9274 was related to the reduced NAD+ reserve in B-ALL cells. NAD+ depletion may be a promising alternative approach to treating patients with B-ALL. cDNA microarray based expression analyses was performed on B-cell ALL cell lines REH, RS4;11 and SEM under control and treated conditions.

Although the consequences of genotoxic injury include cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, cell survival responses after genotoxic injury can produce intrinsic death-resistance and contribute to the development of a transformed phenotype. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are integral components of key survival pathways, and are responsible for their inactivation, while PTP inhibition is are often associated with enhanced cell proliferation. Our aim was to elucidate signaling events that modulate cell survival after genotoxin exposure. Diploid human lung fibroblasts (HLF) were treated with Cr(VI) (as Na2CrO4), a well known human respiratory carcinogen that induces a wide spectrum of DNA damage, in the presence and absence of a broad-range PTP inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate. Notably, PTP inhibition abrogated Cr(VI)-induced clonogenic lethality. The enhanced survival of Cr(VI)-exposed cells after PTP inhibition was predominantly due to a bypass of cell cycle arrest and was not due to decreased Cr uptake as evidenced by unchanged Cr-DNA adduct burden. Additionally, the bypass of Cr-induced growth arrest by PTP inhibition, was accompanied by a decrease in Cr(VI)-induced expression of cell cycle inhibiting genes, and an increase in the Cr(VI)-induced expression of cell cycle promoting genes. Importantly, PTP inhibition resulted in an increase in forward mutations at the HPRT locus, supporting the hypothesis that PTP inhibition in the presence of DNA damage may lead to genomic instability, via bypass of cell cycle checkpoints.

The infants involved were selected based on maternal criteria indicating increased risk for therapeutic intervention. Global mRNA expression was measured in 107 longitudinal whole blood samples using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays; samples were obtained from 20 preterm infants. Unsupervised clustering revealed a distinct homogeneous gene expression pattern in 13 samples derived from seven infants undergoing continuous oxygen therapy.

The infants were reoxygenated with 100% inspired oxygen concentration. The other samples (n=94) represented the infants from the cohort at time points when they did not undergo continuous oxygen therapy. Comparing these two sets of samples identified a distinct gene expression pattern of 5,986 significantly differentially expressed genes, of which 5,167 genes exhibited reduced expression levels during transient hypoxia. This expression pattern was reversed when the infants became stable, i.e., when they were not continuously oxygenated and had no events of hypoxia. To identify signaling pathways involved in gene regulation, the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery online tool was used. Mitogen activated protein kinases, which are normally induced by oxidative stress, exhibited reduced gene expression during hypoxia. In addition, nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 antioxidant response element target genes involved in oxidative stress protection were also expressed at lower levels, suggesting reduced transcription of this pathway. The findings of the present study suggest that oxidative stress dependent signaling is reduced during hypoxia. Understanding the molecular response in preterm infants during continuous oxygenation may aid in refining therapeutic strategies for oxygen therapy. Gene expression levels from 107 longitudinal whole-blood samples from 20 preterm born infants were analyzed from total RNA using NuGen Ovation amplification and Human-Genome-U133 Plus 2.0-arrays from Affymetrix.",

    "text": "Genome-wide screen for promoter methylation in NSCLC identifies novel methylation markers for multiple malignancies. BACKGROUND: Promoter hypermethylation coupled with loss of heterozygosity at the same locus results in loss of gene function in many tumor cells. The \"rules\" governing which genes are methylated during the pathogenesis of individual cancers, how specific methylation profiles are initially established, or what determines tumor type-specific methylation are unknown. However, DNA methylation markers that are highly specific and sensitive for common tumors would be useful for the early detection of cancer, and those required for the malignant phenotype would identify pathways important as therapeutic targets. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In an effort to identify new cancer-specific methylation markers, we employed a high-throughput global expression profiling approach in lung cancer cells. We identified 132 genes that have 5' CpG islands, are induced from undetectable levels by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine in multiple non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, and are expressed in immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells. As expected, these genes were also expressed in normal lung, but often not in companion primary lung cancers. Methylation analysis of a subset (45/132) of these promoter regions in primary lung cancer (n = 20) and adjacent nonmalignant tissue (n = 20) showed that 31 genes had acquired methylation in the tumors, but did not show methylation in normal lung or peripheral blood cells. We studied the eight most frequently and specifically methylated genes from our lung cancer dataset in breast cancer (n = 37), colon cancer (n = 24), and prostate cancer (n = 24) along with counterpart nonmalignant tissues. We found that seven loci were frequently methylated in both breast and lung cancers, with four showing extensive methylation in all four epithelial tumors. CONCLUSIONS: By using a systematic biological screen we identified multiple genes that are methylated with high penetrance in primary lung, breast, colon, and prostate cancers. The cross-tumor methylation pattern we observed for these novel markers suggests that we have identified a partial promoter hypermethylation signature for these common malignancies. These data suggest that while tumors in different tissues vary substantially with respect to gene expression, there may be commonalities in their promoter methylation profiles that represent targets for early detection screening or therapeutic intervention.Keywords: Dose response, cell-type comparison, . We compared the gene expression changes HBEC and NSCLC cells before and after treatment with 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine.",

Inadequate protein intake initiates an accommodative response with adverse changes in skeletal muscle function and structure. mRNA level changes due to short-term inadequate dietary protein might be an early indicator of accommodation. The aims of this study were to assess the effects of dietary protein and the diet-by-age interaction on the skeletal muscle transcript profile. Self-organizing maps were used to determine expression patterns across protein trials.958 transcripts were differentially expressed (P<0.05) with diet and 853 had a diet-by-age interaction (P<0.05) using ANOVA. The results for diet alone revealed that P63 was associated with up-regulation of transcripts related to ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism and muscle contraction and P63 and P94 resulted in up-regulation of transcripts related to apoptosis and down-regulation of transcripts related to cell differentiation; muscle and organ development; extracellular space; and responses to stimuli and stress. The diet-by-age expression patterns demonstrated that across the three protein trials transcripts related to protein metabolism were affected by age. Changes in skeletal muscle mRNA levels in the younger and older males to protein intake near or below the RDA are indicative of an early accommodative response. 5052 transcripts were determined as differentially expressed (P<0.05) between the younger and older males, of which 2556 met the False Discovery Rate correction (P=0.0081). The age-related changes in the transcript profile were consistent with aging skeletal muscle phenotypes including; mitochondrial dysfunction (UP- and DOWN-regulation), RNA splicing (UP), oxidative stress (UP), apoptosis (UP), and energy metabolism (DOWN).Keywords: Age and dietary protein response. 22 healthy free-living younger (21-43 y, n=12) and older (63-79 y, n=10) males completed three controlled feeding trials with protein intakes of 63% (P63: 0.50 g/kg), 94% (P94: 0.75 g/kg), and 125% (P125: 1.00 g/kg) of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA).

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a 152 Kb double stranded DNA alpha-herpesvirus, which establishes long life latent infection in sensory neurons. Most of our knowledge regarding HSV-1 latency comes from in vivo studies using small animal models, mainly rodents and rabbits, which are not naturally infected by HSV-1. Furthermore, these animal models do not fully recapitulate the species specific effects of human HSV-1 infection. Human cellular models utilize trigeminal ganglia removed from cadavers or, alternatively, neuron-like cells derived from cancerous cell lines that do not fully reflect effects on normal human neurons. This limitation poses the need to develop an in vitromodel to investigate molecular details of the mechanisms underlying quiescence and reactivation in human neurons. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) celltechnologies offer an unprecedented opportunity to generate unlimited supplies of neurons and the facility to manipulate such cells in vitro. In this study, we developed an in vitro HSV-1 infection model in human iPS-derived neurons, which displays the main hallmarks of latency defined in animal models and in humans. Our results show for the first time that: i) persistent infection cannot be established in neural progenitor cells (NPCs); ii) the ability of HSV-1 to establish persistent infection is extended to glutamatergic neurons, and not limited to sensory neurons; iii) in neuronal cultures persistently infected with HSV-1, viral genome is localized at the nuclear periphery; iv) HSV-1 acute infection reduces RNA editing at the GluRB site. These results highlight the importance of iPS-based platforms to elucidate unknown aspects of HSV-1 quiescence in human neurons. NPCs were 70-80% confluence.",

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset and fast progression neurodegenerative disease that leads to the loss of motor neurons. Mechanisms of selective motor neuron loss in ALS are unknown. The early events occurring in the spinal cord that may contribute to motor neuron death are not described, neither astrocytes participation in the pre-symptomatic phases of the disease. In order to identify ALS early events, we performed a microarray analysis employing a whole mouse genome platform to evaluate the gene expression pattern of lumbar spinal cords of transgenic SOD1G93A mice and their littermate controls at pre-symptomatic ages of 40 and 80 days. Differentially expressed genes were identified by means of the Bioconductor packages Agi4x44Preprocess and limma. FunNet web based tool was used for analysis of over-represented pathways. Furthermore, immunolabeled astrocytes from 40 and 80 days old mice were submitted to laser microdissection and RNA was extracted for evaluation of a selected gene by qPCR. Statistical analysis has pointed to 492 differentially expressed genes (155 up and 337 down regulated) in 40 days and 1105 (433 up and 672 down) in 80 days old ALS mice. The KEGG pathways tight junction, antigen processing and presentation, oxidative phosphorylation, endocytosis, chemokine signaling pathway, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis and glutamatergic synapse were found over-represented at both 40 and 80 days pre-symptomatic ages. Ube2i gene expression was evaluated in astrocytes from both transgenic ages, being up regulated in 40 and 80 days astrocytes enriched samples. Our data points to important early molecular events occurring in pre-symptomatic phases of ALS in mouse model.

The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with TopHat followed by Cufflinks.Results: our data suggest that circular RNAs identified based on junction sequences in the RNA-seq reads, especially those from Illumina Hiseq sequencing, mostly result from template-switching events during reverse transcription by MMLV-derived reverse transcriptases.

The DUX4 transcription factor is normally expressed in the cleavage stage embryo and regulates genes involved in zygotic genome activation. Mis-expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle, however, is toxic and causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). We recently showed DUX4-induced toxicity is due, in part, to the accumulation of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) with concomitant activation of the PKR viral response pathway. Here, using dsRNA immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing, we determined that DUX4-induced dsRNAs originate from intergenic regions enriched for Alu and LINE-1 elements, endogenous retroviruses, and pericentric human satellite II (HSATII) repeats. DUX4-induced HSATII dsRNAs are formed via temporally controlled bidirectional expression with predominant transcription of one strand preceding the other. Whereas DUX4 activation of dsRNAs derived from intergenic regions such as HSATII contributes to toxicity in FSHD, in the early embryo these dsRNAs might facilitate heterochromatin formation, as has been proposed for cleavage stage expression of mouse major satellites. Double-stranded RNA immunoprecipitations were conducted on MB135-DUX4i cells using K1 or J2 mouse monoclonal antibodies with three replicates per each -/+doxycycline condition which induces DUX4 expression.

Inhibition of MYC promises high therapeutic potential, but specific MYC inhibitors remain unavailable for clinical use. Previous studies suggest that MYC amplified Medulloblastoma cells are vulnerable to HDAC inhibition. Using co-immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry and ChIP-sequencing we show that HDAC2 is a cofactor of MYC in MYC amplified primary medulloblastoma and cell lines. The MYC-HDAC2 complex is bound to genes defining the MYC-dependent transcriptional profile. Class I HDAC inhibition leads to stabilization and reduced DNA binding of MYC protein inducing a down-regulation of MYC activated genes (MAGs) and up-regulation of MYC repressed genes (MRGs). MAGs and MRGs are characterized by opposing biological functions and distinct E-box distribution. We conclude that MYC and HDAC2 (class I) are localized in a complex in MYC amplified medulloblastoma and drive a MYC-specific transcriptional program, which is reversed by the class I HDAC inhibitor entinostat. Thus, the development of HDAC inhibitors for treatment of MYC amplified medulloblastoma should include HDAC2 in its profile in order to directly target MYC's trans-activating and trans-repressing function. In this specific experiment with HDMB03 cells, three technical replicates before treatment (treated with DMSO) and three replicates after treatment with 5mM entinostat(MS275) for 6h were analyzed to understand the effect of treatment on global gene expression dynamics.",

Ex vivo studies on isolated single myofibres showed that Setdb1 is required for adult muscle stem cells expansion following activation.

We identified and validated 5 such compounds, and showed that two of them, alprostadil and trimebutine maleate, enhanced the repair of full thickness skin wounds in middle-aged mice. Moreover, SKPs isolated from drug-treated skin displayed long-term increases in self-renewal when cultured in basal growth medium without drugs. Both alprostadil and trimebutine maleate likely mediated increases in SKPs self-renewal by moderate hyperactivation of the MEK-ERK pathway. These findings identify candidates for potential clinical use in human skin repair, and provide support for the idea that pharmacological activation of endogenous tissue precursors represents a viable therapeutic strategy. We obtained three independent isolates of SKPs from newborn Sprague-Dawley rat pups.

Abnormal beta-catenin staining was associated with mitotic rate and poorer patient survival in the carcinomas. In a second independent data set (given in a supplement) we again found beta-catenin associated with poor survival. The array data given is the same as GEO series GSE10927, with additional characteristics about beta-catenin, and new patient followup data. The analysis shown in a supplementary Excel file is also new. Human samples of 33 adrenocortical carcinomas, 22 adrenocortical adenomas, and 10 normal adrenal cortex samples, each from a different patient, had mRNA assays performed using Affymetrix HG_U133_plus_2 arrays, with 54675 probe-sets. 23 of the carcinomas were used in survival analysis. 27 additional samples without array data were also used in a survival analysis.",

Transcriptional deregulation of oncogenic pathways is a hallmark of cancer, and can be due to epigenetic alterations. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine is a recently discovered epigenetic modification that has not been studied in pancreatic cancer. Genome-wide analysis of 5-hmC enriched loci with hmC-seal was conducted in low-passage pancreatic cancer cell lines and primary patient-derived xenografts and revealed strikingly altered patterns in neoplastic tissues. Differentially hydroxymethylated regions preferentially affected regulatory regions of the genome, specifically overlapping with known H3K4me1 enhancers. Furthermore, base pair resolution analysis of methylation and hydroxymethylation with oxidative bisulfite sequencing was conducted and correlated with chromatin accessibility by ATAC-seq in pancreatic cancer and control samples. 5hmC was specifically enriched at open regions of chromatin and gain of 5-hmC was correlated with upregulation of the cognate transcripts, including many oncogenic pathways implicated in pancreatic neoplasia, such as myc, KRAS, VEGF and BRD4. Specifically, BRD4 was overexpressed and acquired 5hmC at enhancer regions in majority of neoplastic samples. Functionally, acquisition of 5hmC at BRD4 promoter regulated increase in transcript expression. Furthermore, blockade of BRD4 inhibited pancreatic cancer growth in vivo. In summary, redistribution of 5-hmC and preferential enrichment at oncogenic enhancers is a novel regulatory mechanism in human cancer. Gene expression profiling using RNAseq was performed to assess transcriptomic profiles of pancreatic controls and pancreatic cancer cells.",

We observe LIN28 expression in the developing neural tube, colocalizing with SOX2, suggesting a role in neural development. To better understand its normal developmental function, we investigated LIN28 activity during neurogliogenesis in vitro where the succession of neuronal to glial cell fates occurs as it does in vivo. LIN28 expression was high in undifferentiated cells, and was down-regulated rapidly upon differentiation. Constitutive LIN28 expression caused a complete block of gliogenesis and an increase in neurogenesis. LIN28 expression was compatible with neuronal differentiation and did not increase proliferation. LIN28 caused significant changes in gene expression prior to any effect on let-7, notably on Igf2. Furthermore, a mutant LIN28 that permitted let-7 accumulation was still able to completely block gliogenesis. Thus, at least two biological activities of LIN28 are genetically separable and may involve distinct mechanisms. LIN28 can differentially promote and inhibit specific fates and does not function exclusively by blocking let-7 family miRNAs. Importantly, LIN28's role in cell fate succession in vertebrate cells is analogous to its activity as a developmental timing regulator in C. elegans.

CD95 was found to be important for both the formation of CSCs and their maintenance. Using a stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) analysis we have now identified STAT1 as a critical gene that mediates the CSC-driving activity of CD95. We report that chronic stimulation of CD95 by either agonist antibodies, soluble CD95L or stably expressed membrane CD95L causes both serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and activation of STAT1 regulated genes. The genes most significantly induced were part of an interferon (IFN)-related DNA damage resistance signature (IRDS) recently identified in a radiation resistant squamous cell carcinoma cell line Nu61 when compared to parental SCC61 cells. The IRDS was found to strongly correlate with therapy resistance (chemotherapy and radiation) in multiple cancer cells as well as in 5 human primary cancers. We now report that CD95 stimulation of breast cancer cell lines or the SCC61 cells induces the upregulation of Type I IFNs that bind to both Type I receptors IFNAR1 and IFNR2 resulting in activation of JAK kinases, activation of STAT1 and induction of a number of STAT1-regulated genes. This process can be inhibited by active caspases. Consequently, we identified Type I IFNs as drivers of cancer stemness. Knockdown of STAT1 using either siRNAs or shRNAs, or deleting two independent sites in the STAT1 gene in MCF-7 cells using the CRIPSR/Cas9 gene editing system resulted in a loss of the ability of CD95 to increase stemness. This identifies STAT1 as a critical mediator of the CSCs-inducing activity of CD95. Two replicates per condition.",

The fibroblast growth factor pathway is known to cooperate with the highly oncogenic Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in mouse models of breast cancer. To investigate the mechanisms involved in this cooperativity, we utilized MMTV-driven transgenic mouse lines expressing a drug-inducible model for FGF Receptor signaling (iFGFR) crossed with the previously characterized MMTV-Wnt-1 mouse model. In these bigenic mice, both iFGFR1 and iFGFR2 activation resulted in a dramatic enhancement of mammary tumorigenesis. Tumor microarray analysis identified no transcriptional enhancement of Wnt/beta-catenin targets, however, identified a protein translational gene signature that also correlated with elevated FGFR1 and FGFR2 expression in several human breast cancer data sets. Additionally, iFGFR1 activation resulted in enhanced polysome recruitment and a marked increase in protein expression of several different Wnt/beta-catenin target oncogenes. Rapid FGFR-induced ERK activation and phosphorylation of key translation regulators was observed both in vivo in the transgenic mouse model, and in human breast cancer cell lines treated with exogenous FGF. These studies suggest that translational regulation is a key rate-limiting step required for oncogenic cooperativity between the Wnt and FGF pathways. reference X sample.",

This susceptibility is associated with a loss of anti-microbial pathways but also altered local immune responses that include decreased T cell production of IFN-g and elevated expression of inhibitory receptors.

We hypothesized that immediate responses following injury induce vascular remodeling. To differentiate injury due to trauma, reperfusion and pressure changes we analyzed vascular responses to carotid artery bypass grafting in mice compared to transient ligation. As a control, the carotid artery was surgically laid open only. In both, bypass or ligation models, the inflammatory responses were transient, peaking after 6h, whereas the loss of VSMC differentiation gene expression persisted. Extended time kinetics showed that transient carotid artery ligation was sufficient to induce a persistent VSMC phenotype change throughout 28 days. Transient arterial ligation in ApoE knockout mice resulted in atherosclerosis in the transiently ligated vascular segment but not on the not-ligated contralateral side. The VSMC phenotype change could not be prevented by anti-TNF antibodies, Sorafenib, Cytosporone B or N-acetylcysteine treatment.

Here we show that miR-184 is silenced in the pancreatic islets of several insulin-resistant mouse models and in the islets of type-2 diabetic human subjects. Reduction of miR-184 promotes the expression of its target Argonaute2 (Ago2), a component of the microRNA-induced silencing complex. While over-expression of Ago2 increased ss-cell proliferation, conditional deletion decreased ss-cell number. Moreover, restored expression of miR-184 in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice decreased Ago2 and prevented compensatory ss-cell expansion. Loss of Ago2 expression during insulin resistance blocked ss-cell growth and relieved the regulation of miR-375-targeted genes including the growth suppressor Cadm1.

So far, these classification systems have not been validated in liver biopsy specimens from tumors diagnosed at intermediate and late stages. We generated and analyzed expression profiles from 60 HCC biopsies from an unselected patient population with all tumor stages. Unbiased clustering identified 3 HCC classes. Class membership correlated with survival, tumor size, and with Edmondson and BCLC stage. Most biopsy specimens could be assigned to the classes of published classification systems, demonstrating that gene expression profiles obtained from patients with early stage disease are preserved in all stages of HCC. When a reference set of healthy liver samples was integrated in the analysis, we observed that the differentially regulated genes up- or down-regulated in a given class relative to other classes were actually dysregulated in the same direction in all HCCs, with quantitative rather than qualitative differences between the molecular subclasses. With the exception of a subset of samples with a definitive b-catenin gene signature, biological pathway analysis could not identify class specific pathways reflecting the activation of distinct oncogenic programs.

Activated brown adipose tissue contributes to control of energy and glucose homeostasis in rodents and humans. Defining cell-autonomous processes underlying BAT differentiation and activation may thus reveal novel therapeutic targets for obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus intervention. Here we show that ageing- and obesity-associated demises in BAT function coincide with down-regulation of mature microRNAs in BAT in the presence of reduced expression of the critical microRNA processing enzyme Dicer1. To mimic this partial down-regulation of microRNA processing in obesity and ageing, we inactivated one allele of Dicer1 selectively in BAT of mice. BAT- restricted heterozygosity of Dicer1 caused glucose intolerance in lean mice and aggravated diet-induced-obesity (DIO)-evoked deterioration of glucose homeostasis. Using combinatorial analyses of altered microRNA-expression in BAT during in vitro preadipocyte commitment and mouse models of progeria, longevity and DIO, we identified 23 microRNAs dysregulated among these conditions. Of these, we identified miR-328 as a novel regulator of BAT differentiation. miR-328 over-expression promotes BAT-differentiation and impairs muscle progenitor commitment, while reducing miR-328 expression blocks BAT specification. We validated the ss-Secretase Bace1 as a target of miR-328, which is consequently over-expressed in BAT of obese and premature ageing mice. Reducing Bace1 expression enhances brown adipocyte, while impairing myogenic differentiation in vitro. In vivo small-molecule Bace1 inhibition in obese mice delayed DIO-induced weight gain, ameliorated obesity-associated deterioration of glucose metabolism and improved insulin sensitivity. Collectively, these experiments reveal reduced Dicer1-miR-328-Bace1 axis in presence of generalized impairment of microRNA processing in ageing and obesity as a novel determinant of ageing- and obesity-associated decline in BAT function. This may define in vivo Bace1-inhibition as an innovative therapeutic approach to not only target age-related neurodegenerative diseases but at the same time improving age-related impairment of BAT-function and metabolism. C57BL/6 mice ( 4 weeks of age) were treated with a calory-rich, high-sugar high-fat diet (HFD) for a course of 4 weeks.

Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell reprogramming is a gradual epigenetic process that reactivates the pluripotent transcriptional network by erasing and establishing heterochromatin marks. Here, we characterize the physical structure of heterochromatin domains in full and partial mouse iPS cells by correlative Electron Spectroscopic Imaging (ESI). In somatic and partial iPS cells, constitutive heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3 is highly compartmentalized into chromocenter structures of densely packed 10 nm chromatin fibers. In contrast, chromocenter boundaries are poorly defined in pluripotent ES and full iPS cells, and are characterized by unusually dispersed 10 nm heterochromatin fibers in high Nanog-expressing cells, including pluripotent cells of the mouse blastocyst prior to differentiation. This heterochromatin reorganization accompanies retroviral silencing during conversion of partial iPS cells by Mek/Gsk3 2i inhibitor treatment. Thus, constitutive heterochromatin reorganization serves as a novel biomarker with retroviral silencing for identifying iPS cells in the very late stages of reprogramming. We compared the expression profiles of partially and fully reprogrammed iPS cell lines derived from CD1 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFSs) by retroviral reprogramming (pMX-Oct4, pMX-Klf4 and pMX-Sox2). to the differentiated MEFS and the J1 embryonic stem cell line.

    "text": "Comparative transcriptional profiling of the lung discriminates S. pneumoniae and Influenza A Virus infections. Peumonia is the most common cause of death due to infectious diseases in the western hemisphere. The molecular events associated with pulmonary infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Influenza A virus are incompletely understood. Pathophysiological and protective processes are initiated by immune receptors specifically recognizing pathogenic structures serving to elicit a qualitatively and quantitatively adequate immune response. To provide a molecular framework towards a better understanding of the processes relevant in severe infectious pneumonia we performed a transcriptome analysis of lungs from mice infected with S. pneumoniae or Influenza A virus. Overall, we detected 1300 genes that exhibit significant differential expression after infection with either pathogen. Of those were approximately 36 % specific for pneumococcal and 30 % specific for the viral infection, yielding pathogen-specific as well as common inflammatory transcriptional signatures. Characteristically, these results resolve not only a differential response on the cytokine and chemokine level, although common induction of type I and type II interferons, TNFa, and IL-6 underlies both infections, but emphasize the potentially important role exerted by many genes implicated in the regulation and fine tuning of the inflammatory response. Furthermore, we noted a specific decrease in B cells after S. pneumoniae infection, which is not solely confined to the lung. Massive induction of apoptosis in pulmonary B cells could reflect a pneumococcal virulence strategy aiming against the lymphocyte population that is of utmost importance for the defence against capsulated bacteria. The pathophysiological consequences of Influenza A virus infection become obvious through differential induction of genes implicated in tissue regeneration and proliferation associated with detection of the emerging protective T cell response. These results may provide new insights into the pathogenesis and protective mechanisms important for the development of improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Keywords: pathogen comparison, time course. Microarray analyses were performed as two-colour hybridizations. RNA was labelled with a Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent Technologies). Briefly, 4 ug total RNA was reverse transcribed with an oligo-dT-T7 promoter primer and MMLV-RT. Second strand synthesis was carried out with random hexamers. Fluorescent antisense cRNA was synthesized with either cyanine 3-CTP (Cy3-CTP) or cyanine 5-CTP (Cy5-CTP) and T7 polymerase. Purified products were quantified at A552nm for Cy3-CTP and A650nm for Cy5-CTP. Prior hybridization, 1.25 ug labelled cRNA each were fragmented, mixed with control targets and hybridization buffer according to the supplier's protocol (Agilent Technologies). Hybridizations were performed for 17 h at 60degC. The slides were washed according to the manufacturer's protocol and scanning of the arrays was performed with 5 um resolution using a DNA microarray laser scanner (Agilent Technologies). To compensate for dye specific effects, and to ensure validity of the data, a colour swap analysis (fluorescence reversal) was performed. Features were extracted with the image analysis tool Version A6.1.1.1 from Agilent Technologies. Subsequent data analyses were carried out on the Rosetta Inpharmatics platform Resolver Built 3.2.2.

The evolving and highly heterogeneous nature of malignant brain tumors underlies their limited response to therapy and poor prognosis. In addition to genetic alterations, highly dynamic processes such as transcriptional and metabolic reprograming play an important role in the development of tumor heterogeneity. The present study reports an adaptive mechanism in which the metabolic environment of malignant glioma drives transcriptional reprogramming. Multi-regional analysis of a glioblastoma patient biopsy revealed a metabolic landscape marked by varying stages of hypoxia and creatine enrichment. Creatine treatment and metabolism was further shown to promote a synergistic effect through up-regulation of the glycine-cleavage system and chemical regulation of Prolyl-Hydroxylase Domain (PHD). Consequently, creatine maintained a reduction of reactive oxygen species and change of the a-ketoglutarate/succinate ratio leading to an inhibition of the HIF-signaling in primary tumor cell lines. These effects shifted the transcriptional pattern toward a proneural subtype and reduced the rate of cell migration and invasion in vitro. For metabolic treatment, different metabolites were supplemented into the medium. Creatine-enriched environment was simulated by 15 mMol creatine supplementation.

Therapies that boost the anti-tumor responses of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) have shown promise in the clinic. However, clinical responses to currently available immunotherapeutic agents vary considerably, for which the molecular basis is unclear. To date, unbiased transcriptomic studies of CTLs in human cancers have been performed in whole tumors or cells obtained from peripheral blood or metastatic sites of heavily pre-treated patients. We performed global transcriptional profiling of CTLs in tumors and adjacent non-tumor tissue from treatment-naive patients with early stage lung cancer to define the molecular features associated with robustness of anti-tumor immune responses. We observed major differences in the transcriptional program of tumor-infiltrating CTLs that are shared across tumor subtypes. Pathway analysis revealed enrichment of genes in cell cycle, T cell receptor (TCR) activation and co-stimulation pathways, indicating tumor-driven expansion of presumed tumor antigen-specific CTLs. We also observed marked heterogeneity in the expression of molecules associated with TCR activation and immune checkpoints such as 4-1BB, PD1, TIM3, and their expression was positively correlated with the density of tumor-infiltrating CTLs. Interestingly, transcripts linked to tissue-resident memory cells (TRM), such as CD103, were enriched in tumors containing a high density of CTLs, and CTLs from CD103high tumors displayed features of enhanced cytotoxicity, implying better anti-tumor activity. In an independent cohort of 689 lung cancer patients, we confirmed that patients with CD103high (TRM rich) tumors survived significantly longer. In summary, we define the molecular fingerprint of tumor-infiltrating CTLs at the site of primary tumor and identify a number of novel targets that may be important in modulating the magnitude and specificity of anti-tumor immune responses in lung cancer.

NRCP was highly upregulated in ovarian tumors and knockdown of NRCP resulted in significantly increased apoptosis, decreased cell proliferation, and decreased glycolysis compared with control cancer cells. In an orthotopic mouse model of ovarian cancer, siNRCP delivered via a liposomal carrier significantly reduced tumor growth compared with control treatment.

To investigate the underlying molecular principles of metabolic and morphogenic zonation of the human liver lobule, we generated an integrated epigenetic map across three zones (pericentral, intermediate and periportal) by methylation and transcriptomic analysis of hepatocytes captured by laser micro-dissection. We observe a deep link between epigenetic zonation of human liver and a zonated expression of metabolic and morphogenic pathways: Key transcriptionally zonated enzymes in xenobiotic and glutamine metabolism show a strong anticorrelated methylation gradient indicating that zonal expression of these genes is partly controlled by epigenetic programs. Zonated DNA-methylation at binding sites of uniformly expressed transcription factors such as HNF4A and RXRa points to an epigenetic layer in regulatory networks and a zonated activity of their nuclear ligands and drugs such as fibrates and bile acids. The same holds for genes of the wnt morphogen pathway whose expression show a zonated methylation at binding sites of TCF4L2. A strong pericentral expression of LGR5 and AXIN2 and a corresponding expression gradient of the liver progenitor marker TBX3, indicates a predominant pericentral source of hepatocyte regeneration under steady-state conditions in humans. Conversely, the periportal expression of NOTCH and EPCAM at the border to the biliary tree as source of regeneration under injury conditions.

Molecular mechanisms triggered by high dietary beta-carotene (BC) intake in lung are largely unknown. We performed microarray gene expression analysis on lung tissue of BC supplemented beta-carotene 15,150-monooxygenase 1 knockout (Bcmo1-/-) mice, which are--like humans--able to accumulate BC. Our main observation was that the genes were regulated in an opposite direction in male and female Bcmo1-/- mice by BC. The steroid biosynthetic pathway was overrepresented in BC-supplemented male Bcmo1-/- mice. Testosterone levels were higher after BC supplementation only in Bcmo1-/- mice, which had, unlike wild-type (Bcmo1+/+) mice, large variations. We hypothesize that BC possibly affects hormone synthesis or metabolism. Since sex hormones influence lung cancer risk, these data might contribute to an explanation for the previously found increased lung cancer risk after BC supplementation (ATBC and CARET studies). Moreover, effects of BC may depend on the presence of frequent human BCMO1 polymorphisms, since these effects were not found in wild-type mice.

Mucispirillum schaedleri is an abundant inhabitant of the intestinal mucus layer of rodents and other animals. To gain insights into its lifestyle, we analyzed the genome and transcriptome of M. schaedleri ASF 457 and tested for traits predicted by the genome using physiological experiments. Although thought to be a mucus degrader, its genome surprisingly predicts that M. schaedleri has limited capacity for degrading host-derived mucosal glycans or other complex polysaccharides. Rather, it may utilize small compounds such as peptides, amino acids, glycerol, and short chain fatty acids. Additionally, it can reduce nitrate and has systems for scavenging oxygen and reactive oxygen species, which accounts for its presence close to the mucosal tissue and during inflammation. Also of note, M. schaedleri harbors a type VI secretion system (T6SS) and several putative effector proteins containing eukaryotic domains, which suggest intimate interactions with the host and a role in inflammation. Examination of the individual phylogenies of all genes in the M. schaedleri genome revealed extensive horizontal gene transfer, primarily from intestinal Epsilon- and Deltaproteobacteria. Though M. schaedleri utilizes non-horizontally-transferred pathways (e.g. nitrate reduction), horizontally-acquired pathways from gut organisms (e.g. T6SS and glycerol-P utilization) are also likely also important for its survival in the intestine, suggesting that lateral gene transfer may have played a key role in facilitating its establishment in the gut ecosystem.

TREM2 and DAP12 constitute a receptor/adaptor complex expressed on osteoclasts, dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, and microglia. At present, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying development of leukoencephalopathy and bone cysts in NHD remain largely unknown. We established THP-1 human monocyte clones that stably express small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting DAP12 for serving as a cellular model of NHD. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis identified a set of 22 genes consistently downregulated in DAP12 knockdown cells. They constituted the molecular network closely related to the network defined by cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, hematological system development and function, and inflammatory response, where NF-kappaB acts as a central regulator. These results suggest that a molecular defect of DAP12 in human monocytes deregulates the gene network pivotal for maintenance of myeloid cell function in NHD.

The siRNA vector construct targeting the DAP12 sequence (SI) and the control vector construct targeting the scrambled sequence (SCR) were generated by using GeneClip U1 Hairpin cloning system (Promega). The vectors were transfected in THP-1 cells by using Lipofectamine LTX reagent. The stable cell lines were selected by incubating them for approximately two months in the feeding medium with inclusion of 200 microgram/ml Hygromycin B. Then, two SI clones named SI5 and SI17, in addition to two SCR clones named SCR1 and SCR4, were selected by limiting dilution of the cells in a manner of a single cell per well plated in a 96-well cell culture plate.Microarray data for clones SCR4 and SI17 submitted in this Series.",

We report that developmental competition between sympathetic neurons for survival is critically dependent on a sensitization process initiated by target innervation and mediated by a series of feedback loops. Target-derived nerve growth factor (NGF) promoted expression of its receptor TrkA in neurons and prolonged TrkA-mediated signals. NGF also controlled expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4 (NT4), which, through the receptor p75, can kill neighboring neurons with low retrograde NGF-TrkA signaling whereas neurons with high NGF-TrkA signaling are protected. Perturbation of any of these feedback loops disrupts the dynamics of competition. We suggest that three target-initiated events are essential for rapid and robust competition between neurons: sensitization, paracrine apoptotic signaling, and protection from such effects.

The current standard therapy for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) consists of a combination of pegylated IFN alpha (pegIFN-alpha) and ribavirin. It achieves a sustained viral clearance in only 50-60% of patients. To learn more about molecular mechanisms underlying treatment failure, we investigated IFN-induced signaling in paired liver biopsies collected from CHC patients before and after administration of pegIFN-alpha. In patients with a rapid virological response to treatment, pegIFN-alpha induced a strong up-regulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). As shown previously, nonresponders had high expression levels of ISGs before therapy. Analysis of posttreatment biopsies of these patients revealed that pegIFN-alpha did not induce expression of ISGs above the pretreatment levels. In accordance with ISG expression data, phosphorylation, DNA binding, and nuclear localization of STAT1 indicated that the IFN signaling pathway in nonresponsive patients is preactivated and refractory to further stimulation. Some features characteristic of nonresponders were more accentuated in patients infected with HCV genotypes 1 and 4 compared with genotypes 2 and 3, providing a possible explanation for the poor response of the former group to therapy. Taken together with previous findings, our data support the concept that activation of the endogenous IFN system in CHC not only is ineffective in clearing the infection but also may impede the response to therapy, most likely by inducing a refractory state of the IFN signaling pathway.Keywords: Comparison of human patient biopses before and after interferon treatment.

While isolation of MSCs correlates with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the physiologic role of these cells remains unclear. To address this, we further characterized the cells, focusing on the issues of gene expression, origin and cytokine expression.

Compared to lung fibroblasts, 710 gene probe transcripts were differentially expressed by the lung MSCs, including IL-6 and IL-8/CXCL8. Further, neonatal lung MSCs exhibited a pattern of Hox gene expression distinct from cord-blood MSCs but similar to human fetal lung fibroblasts, consistent with a lung origin.

Among other stromal cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to be present within the TME and to be involved in cancer progression. However the majority of previous studies have been performed on bone marrow-derived MSCs. To investigate the role of the TME on the pulmonary MSC phenotype, we compared the expression profile of paired MSCs isolated from lung tumor (T-) and normal adjacent tissues (N-) from lung carcinoma patients.We used microarray data to find differentially expressed genes between N- and T-MSCs and identified several genes associated with poor prognosis that are more highly expressed in T- than in N-MSCs and potentially involved in the MSC promotion of lung cancer metastasis.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) and cancer pathophysiology share common signal transduction pathways leading to abnormal endothelial and smooth muscle cell interactions and angioproliferative vasculopathy. Sorafenib (Sor) a drug in clinical trials for cancer treatment, is an inhibitor of multiple kinases important in angiogenesis (Raf-1 kinase, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, PDGFR-beta). In this study, we assessed the efficacy of Sor as a potential therapy for PH, and hypothesized that Sor prevents the development of both a conventional and an augmented rodent model of PH. We performed studies in Dahl Salt-Sensitive rats (SS) exposed to hypoxia alone and in combination with the VEGFR-2 inhibitor, SU5416, known to induce a well-characterized augmented PH phenotype. Rats were, thus, divided into 5 groups: normoxia/vehicle (Norm), hypoxia/vehicle (H), hypoxia/ SU5416 (H-SU), hypoxia/Sorafenib (H-Sor) and hypoxia/ SU5416/ Sorafenib (H-SU-Sor). Except for the Norm group, all rats were maintained in a hypoxia chamber with a FiO2 of 10%. Rats received a single injection of SU5416 on Day 1 (20 mg/kg) and Sor solution was administered daily by gavage (2.5mg/kg). After 3.5 weeks, all rats were assessed by open chest catheterizations for pulmonary vascular and right ventricular pressures. Lung and heart tissue were harvested for histological and microarray analyses. Our results showed H-SU rats developed severe PH with changes in hemodynamic and histologic parameters when compared to Norm controls while rats exposed to H alone only displayed mildly elevated pressures compared with Norm. There was no significant change in pressures in the H-Sor or H-SU-Sor compared to Norm. Histopathology demonstrated a dramatic prevention of the PH phenotype in the H-SU-Sor rats with no significant remodeling compared with H-SU rats. Expression profiling data from H (n=4) and H-SU (n=3) rat lungs were compared to Norm (n=4) using normalization in R and SAM (d>.639,) (minimum fold change >1.4). With false discovery rates (FDR) of 6.5% in hypoxia and 1.6% in H-SU, 1019 and 465 genes, respectively, were differentially-regulated compared to Norm. In addition, 38 genes were differentially expressed between H-SU and H-SU-Sor (n=4, FDR 6.7%) revealing a molecular signature with potentially novel target genes of Sor. Five differentially expressed genes (Tgfbeta3, C1qg, Nexn, Frzb, and Plaur) were examined by real-time RT-PCR and three were further validated by immunohistochemistry confirming the regulation on protein level. Based on the known pathways of hypoxic-induced PH and Sor, we further utilized immunohistochemistry to show the up-regulation of mediators of the MAPK cascade in the H and H-SU models of PH with subsequent, down-regulation by Sor. We therefore present Sor as a novel treatment for the development of severe PH and theorize that the MAPK cascade is a canonical pathway involved both in the development of PH and in the attenuation by Sor.Keywords: Drug Effect. Rats were divided into 5 groups of which 4 groups were analyzed by microarrays: normoxia/vehicle (n=4), hypoxia/vehicle (n=4), hypoxia/ SU5416 (n=3), and hypoxia/ SU5416/ Sorafenib (n=4).

However, the contribution of lncRNAs to GBC is still vague. In order to explore the potential lncRNAs involved in GBC, we described lncRNAs profiles in 3 pairs of human GBC tissues and the matched peri-carcinomatous tissues by microarray. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used for the validation of the microarray data. To understand potential functions, Gene Ontology (GO), KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis and network analysis were employed to figure out significant pathways. With abundant RNA probes, we detected 1,758 lncRNAs and 1,254 mRNAs differentially expressed in the microarray. Compared with PCT (Para-carcinoma tissue), plenty of lncRNAs were significantly up-regulated or down-regulated in GBC. Our data showed that lncRNAs down-regulated in GBC were much more than those up-regulated. Among them, RP11-152P17.2-006 was the most up-regulated, while CTA-941F9.9 was the most down-regulated. The results of qRT-PCR agreed with the data from the microarray. Pathway analysis indicated that 5 pathways were corresponded to differentially expressed transcripts. The data showed that the expression of lncRNAs in GBC was significantly changed, and a series of new lncRNAs associated with GBC were identified.

Interrogation of global DNA methylation patterns for such specimens has not been reported, though such analyses are needed to uncover novel molecular factors driving disease. Materials and Methods: We evaluated global DNA methylation patterns for 30 biopsies obtained from 10 patients undergoing surgical removal of an OSCC or carcinoma in situ (CIS). From a disease field in each patient, we collected i) dysplastic, ii) CIS or OSCC, and iii) adjacent normal biopsies. DNA isolated from each biopsy was profiled for methylation status using the Illumina HumanMethylation27K platform. Results: Our data demonstrate that aberrant methylation of promoter CpG islands exists across oral precancer and OSCC genomes. Non-hierarchical clustering of all methylation data revealed distinct methylation patterns between the normal and the CIS/OSCC tissues (with results for dysplastic biopsies split between groups). Multiple genes exhibiting recurrent aberrant DNA methylation were found for both dysplastic and CIS/OSCC groups, and included enrichment for genes found in the WNT and MAPK signaling pathways. Conclusion: In identifying aberrant DNA methylation at the earliest stages of oral precancer and finding recurring epigenetic disruption of specific genes/pathways across our analyzed cohort, we conclude that CpG methylation changes are a hallmark of oral cancer progression and that global DNA methylation analyses are an essential component for wider studies seeking to derive biomarkers or potentially druggable targets for improving oral cancer outcomes.

There is interest in discovering a pharmacologic exercise mimetic that could imbue wellness and alleviate disease burden. However, the molecular physiology by which exercise signals the transcriptional response is highly complex, making it challenging to identify a single target for pharmacological mimicry. The current studies evaluated the transcriptome responses in skeletal muscle, heart, liver, and white and brown adipose to novel small molecule activators of AMPK (pan-activators for all AMPK isoforms) compared to that of exercise. A striking level of congruence between exercise and pharmacological AMPK activation was observed across the induced transcriptome of these five tissues. However, differences in acute metabolic response between exercise and pharmacologic AMPK activation were observed, notably for acute glycogen balances and related to the energy expenditure induced by exercise but not pharmacologic AMPK activation. Nevertheless, intervention with repeated daily administration of short-acting activation of AMPK was found to mitigate hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in four rodent models of metabolic disease and without the cardiac glycogen accretion noted with sustained pharmacologic AMPK activation. These findings affirm that activation of AMPK is a key node governing exercise mediated transcription and is an attractive target as an exercise mimetic.

Although recent studies support regenerative potential based on cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), it remains unclear what cues regulate CPC fate. Using 2- and 3D-culture models, we demonstrate that the two most abundantly expressed matrix proteins in the heart, laminin and fibronectin, have opposite roles in CPC fate decision. CPCs on fibronectin showed predominantly nuclear localization of the transcriptional co-activator YAP and maintained proliferation. In contrast, seeding on laminin induced cytosolic retention and degradation of YAP and altered gene expression, which preceded decreased proliferation and enhanced lineage commitment. RNA-sequencing identified Plk2 as candidate target gene of YAP. Plk2 expression depended on YAP stability, was rapidly downregulated on laminin, and its regulation was sufficient to rescue and/or mimic the CPC response to laminin and fibronectin, respectively. These findings propose a novel role of Plk2 and identify an early molecular mechanism in matrix-instructed CPC fate with potential implications for therapeutic cardiac regeneration.

MVs from healthy donors or reconstituted synthetic MVs can be converted to TLR4 agonists by limited oxidation, while prolonged oxidation abrogates the activity.

Unlike other members of the MAPK family, ERK5 contains a large C-terminal domain with transcriptional activation capability in addition to an N-terminal canonical kinase domain. Genetic deletion of ERK5 is embryonic lethal and tissue-restricted deletions have profound effects on erythroid development, cardiac function and neurogenesis. In addition, depletion of ERK5 is anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic. Small molecule inhibition of ERK5 has been shown to have promising activity in cell and animal models of inflammation and oncology. Here we report the synthesis and biological characterization of potent, selective ERK5 inhibitors. In contrast to both genetic depletion/deletion of ERK5 and inhibition with previously reported compounds, inhibition of the kinase with the most selective of the new inhibitors had no anti-inflammatory or anti-proliferative activity. The source of efficacy in previously reported ERK5 inhibitors is shown to be off-target activity on bromodomains (BRDs), conserved protein modules involved in recognition of acetyl-lysine residues during transcriptional processes. It is likely that phenotypes reported from genetic deletion or depletion of ERK5 arise from removal of a non-catalytic function of ERK5. The newly reported inhibitors should be useful in determining which of the many reported phenotypes are due to kinase activity, and delineate which can be pharmacologically targeted. Two cellular models with reported ERK5-regulated signaling were used: Pam3CSK4-stimulated HUVECs as a model of inflammation, and EGF-stimulated HeLa cells as an established cell model of ERK5 regulation.

Notch-dependent BCL11B induction converts thymus seeding precursor cells into committed T cell progenitors that subsequently differentiate into T cells bearing either the gd or ab T cell receptor. In human, strong Notch activation favors gd T cell development at the expense of ab-lineage differentiation, but the underlying molecular mechanism has remained unclear. Therefore, we performed paired mRNA and miRNA profiling across 11 stages of human T cell development, including developing gd T cells. We identify the miR-17-92 cluster as a direct Notch target and show that miR-17 promotes human TCRgd T cell development by targeting BCL11B, a gene required for ab but not for gd T cell development. Thus, following its role as a licensing factor to induce BCL11B expression in early T cell precursors, Notch activation limits BCL11B expression through miR-17 until thymocytes have passed the b-selection checkpoint when Notch activation is turned off. Hereby Notch prevents premature BCL11B upregulation that is required for ab-lineage differentiation and this results in preferential gd-lineage differentiation. Our work unravels a dual role for Notch in controlling BCL11B expression during intrathymic differentiation and provides a unique resource for understanding the mRNA/miRNA interactions that control human T cell development.We used microarrays in order to profile gene expression in CD34+ thymocytes before culture and after 5 or 10 days culture on OP9 stromal cells expressing Notch ligands JAG1, JAG2, DLL1 or DLL4.

Mechanistically, UBE2O specifically targets AMPKa2 for ubiquitination and degradation, and thereby promotes activation of the mTOR-HIF1a pathway. Notably, inactivation of AMPKa2, but not AMPKa1, abrogates the tumor attenuation caused by UBE2O-loss, while treatment with rapamycin or inhibition of HIF1a ablates UBE2O-dependent tumor biology. Finally, pharmacological blockade of UBE2O inhibits tumorigenesis through the restoration of AMPKa2, suggesting the UBE2O-AMPKa2 axis as a potential cancer therapeutic target. In order to elucidate the pathophysiological impact of UBE2O loss, we generated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), derived from day 13.5 embryos of C57BL6 mice, stably expressing control or Ube2o shRNA.

In spite of these back-up mechanisms, vaccination against enteric pathogens such as Rotavirus has limited success in some populations.Genetic and environmental signals experienced during early life are known to influence mucosal immunity, yet the mechanisms for how these exposures operate remain unclear. Here we used Rotavirus infection to follow antigen-specific IgA responses through time and in different gut compartments. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we tested the role of a pathway known to support IgA responses (Lymphotoxin - LT) at different developmental stages. We found that LT-beta receptor (LTbR) signalling in early life programs intestinal IgA responses in adulthood by affecting antibody class switch recombination to IgA and subsequent generation of IgA antibody-secreting cells within an intact MLN.

Conventional DNase sequencing (DNase-seq) for genome-wide DHSs profiling is limited by the requirement of millions of cells4, 5. Here we report an ultrasensitive strategy, called single-cell DNase sequencing (scDNase-seq) for detection of genome-wide DHSs in single cells. We show that DHS patterns at the single-cell level are highly reproducible among individual cells. Among different single cells, highly expressed gene promoters and enhancers associated with multiple active histone modifications display constitutive DHS whereas chromatin regions with fewer histone modifications exhibit high variation of DHS. Furthermore, the single-cell DHSs predict enhancers that regulate cell-specific gene expression programs and the cell-to-cell variations of DHS are predictive of gene expression. Finally, we apply scDNase-seq to pools of tumour cells and pools of normal cells, dissected from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue slides from patients with thyroid cancer, and detect thousands of tumour-specific DHSs. Many of these DHSs are associated with promoters and enhancers critically involved in cancer development. Analysis of the DHS sequences uncovers one mutation (chr18: 52417839G>C) in the tumour cells of a patient with follicular thyroid carcinoma, which affects the binding of the tumour suppressor protein p53 and correlates with decreased expression of its target gene TXNL1.

To fill this gap, we performed ChIP-chip in combination with transcriptional profiling on HepG2 human hepatoma cells treated with the PPARa agonist GW7647. We found that GW7647 increased PPARa binding to 4220 binding regions.

Our data furthermore demonstrate interaction between PPARa and STAT transcription factors in PPARa-mediated transcriptional repression, and suggest interaction between PPARa and TBP and C/EBPa in PPARa-mediated transcriptional activation. Overall, our analysis leads to important new insights into the mechanisms and impact of transcriptional regulation by PPARa in human liver and highlight the importance of cross-talk with other transcription factors. HepG2 cells were grown in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin. Cells were split the day before experiments. Cells were kept at 37 degC and 5% CO2. The following day, cells were treated with either 100 nM of the PPARa agonist GW7647 or control vehicle (DMSO). Cells used for gene expression analysis were harvested after 6 h or 24 h of GW7647 treatment.This submission represents the gene expression component of the study.",

Clinical and genetic heterogeneity associated with retinal diseases makes stem cell-based therapies an attractive strategy for personalized medicine. However, we have limited understanding of the timing of key events in the developing human retina, and in particular the factors critical for generating the unique architecture of the fovea and surrounding macula. Here we define three key epochs in the transcriptome dynamics of human retina from fetal day (D) 52 to 150. Coincident histological analyses confirmed the cellular basis of transcriptional changes and highlighted the dramatic acceleration of development in the fovea compared to peripheral retina. Human and mouse retinal transcriptomes show remarkable similarity in developmental stages, though morphogenesis was greatly expanded in humans. Integration of DNA accessibility data allowed us to reconstruct transcriptional networks controlling photoreceptor differentiation. Our studies provide insights into human retinal development and serve as resource for molecular staging of human stem cell-derived retinal organoids.

Objective: Rituximab displays therapeutic benefits in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients resistant to TNF blockade. However, the precise role of B cells in the pathogenesis of RA is still unknown. In this study we investigated the global molecular effects of rituximab in synovial biopsies obtained from anti-TNF resistant RA patients before and after administration of the drug.Methods: Paired synovial biopsies were obtained from the affected knee of anti-TNF resistant RA patients before (T0) and 12 weeks after initiation of rituximab therapy (T12). Total RNA was extracted, labeled according to standard Affymetrix procedures and hybridized on GeneChip HGU133 Plus 2.0 slides. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR experiments were performed to confirm the differential expression of selected transcripts.Results: According to paired Student's t-tests, 549 out of 54,675 investigated probe sets were differentially expressed between T0 and T12. Pathway analysis revealed that genes down-regulated between T0 and T12 were significantly enriched in immunoglobulin genes, and genes involved in chemotaxis, leucocyte activation and immune responses (Gene Ontology annotations). By contrast, genes up-regulated between T0 and T12 were significantly enriched in transcripts involved in cell development (Gene Ontology annotation) and wound healing (GSEA). At baseline, higher synovial expression of immunoglobulin genes was associated with response to therapy.Conclusion: Rituximab displays unique effects on global gene expression profiles in synovial tissue of RA patients. These observations open new perspectives in the understanding of the biological effects of the drug and in the selection of patients likely to benefit from this therapy. Twenty patients with RA (17 women and 3 men, average age +/- SEM: 52,6+/-3,8 years) were included in the study. All patients met the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for the diagnosis of RA. All patients had active disease at the time of tissue sampling and were resistant to TNF blockade. They all had erosive changes imaged on conventional x-rays of the hands and/or feet. All of them had a swollen knee at inclusion. Rituximab therapy was administrated at a dose of 1,000 mg IV at baseline (T0) and at week 2, together with 125 mg IV Methylprednisolone. Clinical parameters at baseline (T0) and 12 weeks after the initiation of therapy (T12) was evaluated using DAS(28)-CRP scores and clinical responses were assessed using EULAR response criteria. Synovial biopsies were obtained by needle-arthroscopy of an affected knee from all patients at T0 and T12. For each procedure, 4 to 8 synovial samples were kept overnight at 4degC in a RNA stabilizing solution (RNALater, Ambion, Applied Biosystems, TX, USA) and then stored at -80degC for later RNA extraction. The same amount of tissue was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80degC for immunostaining experiments on frozen sections. The remaining material was fixed in 10% formaldehyde and paraffin embedded for conventional optical evaluation and immunostaining of selected markers. All the experiments (RNA extraction, histology, immunohistochemistry) were performed on at least 4 biopsies harvested during every procedure in order to correct for variations related to the potential heterogeneous distribution of synovial inflammation. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Universite catholique de Louvain and informed consent was obtained from all patients.At least 1 ug total RNA could be extracted from 12 paired samples at T0 and T12 for further processing.",

Endothelial-specific deletion of the Notch effector RBPJK or systemic deletion of the Notch1 receptor in athero-susceptible ApoE-/- mice fed a HC diet for 6 weeks resulted in reduced atherosclerosis in the aortic arch and sinus. Intravital microscopy revealed decreased leukocyte rolling on the endothelium of ApoE-/-;RBPJflox/flox;Cdh5- CreERT, that correlated with the lesser presence of leukocyts and macrophages in the vascular wall. Consistent with this, transcriptome analysis revealed that proinflammatory and endothelial activation pathways were downregulated in atherosclerotic tissue of RBPJk-mutant mice.. Jagged1 signaling upregulation in endothelial cells promotes the physical interaction and nuclear translocation of the intracellular domain of the Notch1 receptor (N1ICD) with NF-kB,. This N1ICD and NF-kB interaction is required for reciprocal transactivation of target genes including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (Vcam1).

The transcription factor TCF7L2 is indispensable for intestinal tissue homeostasis where it transmits mitogenic Wnt/b-Catenin signals in stem and progenitor cells, from which intestinal tumors arise. Yet, TCF7L2 belongs to the most frequently mutated genes in colorectal cancer (CRC), and growth inhibitory functions of TCF7L2 were proposed. This apparent paradox calls for a clarification of the role of TCF7L2 in colorectal carcinogenesis. Here, we investigated TCF7L2 dependence/independence of CRC cells, and the cellular and molecular consequences of TCF7L2 loss-of-function. By genome editing we readily achieved complete TCF7L2 inactivation in several CRC cell lines without loss of viability, showing that CRC cells have widely lost the strict requirement for TCF7L2. Albeit phenotypic changes manifested in a cell-line-specific fashion, TCF7L2-negative cells exhibited morphological changes, enhanced migration and invasion, and augmented collagen adhesion. Additionally, TCF7L2 deficiency led to reduced proliferation, reminiscent of the physiological role of TCF7L2. To provide a molecular framework for the observed phenotypic changes, we performed global transcriptome profiling. This identified gene-regulatory networks in which TCF7L2 positively regulates the proto-oncogene MYC, while repressing the cell cycle inhibitors CDKN2C/CDKN2D. TCF7L2 also suppresses the pro-metastatic transcription factor RUNX2 and several integrin genes, which is consistent with increased motility and collagen adhesion of TCF7L2-deficient cells. Altogether, we conclude that the proliferation-stimulating activity of TCF7L2 persists in CRC cells. Additionally, TCF7L2 acts as invasion suppressor. Despite its negative impact on cell cycle progression, TCF7L2 loss-of-function may thereby increase malignancy, which could explain why TCF7L2 is mutated in a sizeable fraction of colorectal tumors. TCF7L2 knockout (KO) clones were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system targeting exon 6 in HCT116 and HT29 cells. RNA from one wild-type (WT) and one knockout clone was processed and submitted for sequencing for HCT116 cells.

We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression to identify TNF-induced genes that are negatively regulated by EHMT1Transcriptional homeostasis relies on the balance between positive and negative regulation of gene transcription. Methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) is commonly correlated with gene repression. Here, we report that a euchromatic H3K9 methyltransferase, EHTM1, functions as a negative regulator in both the NF-kB- and type I interferon-mediated gene induction pathways. EHMT1 catalyzes H3K9 methylation at promoters of NF-kB target genes. Moreover, EHMT1 interacts with p50 and, surprisingly, p50 appears to repress the expression of type I interferon genes and genes activated by type I interferons by recruiting EHMT1 to catalyze H3K9 methylation at their promoter regions. Silencing the expression of EHMT1 by RNA interference enhances expression of a subset NF-kB regulated genes, augments interferon production and augments antiviral immunity. HeLa cells were double-transfected with control or EHMT1 specific siRNAs. The cells were then treated with or without TNFa for 2 hours followed by RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.",

Atherosclerosis is characterized by thickening of the arterial wall and is the primary cause of the coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease, two of the most common causes of illness and death worldwide. One of the leading risk factors for development of atherosclerosis is familial hypercholesterolemia. Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disorder, which is caused by mutations mainly located in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. It is characterized by elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the presence of tendon xanthomas, and premature cardiovascular disease. Aim of this study was to find atherosclerotic markers in white blood cells of patients compared to healthy controls. None of these patients exhibited symptoms of atherosclerosis by standard diagnostic methods; however, transcriptome analysis of blood RNA indicated changes in ubiquitin proteolysis and cell adhesion system as expected in initiation steps of atherosclerosis. Five patients diagnosed with Familial hypercholesterolemia and five age, sex, BMI and smoking status matched controls contributed blood from which total RNA from white blood cells was isolated.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly heterogeneous disease both from a molecular and clinical perspective. Several distinct molecular entities, such as microsatellite instability (MSI), have been defined that make up biologically distinct subgroups with their own clinical course. Recent data indicated that CRC can be best segregated into four groups called Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMS1-4), which each have a unique biology and gene expression pattern. In order to develop improved, subtype-specific therapies and to gain insight into the molecular wiring and origin of these subtypes, reliable models are needed. This study was designed to determine the heterogeneity and identify the presence of CMSs in a large panel of CRC cell lines, primary cultures and patient-derived xenografts (PDX). We provide a repository encompassing this heterogeneity and moreover describe that a large part of the models can be robustly assigned to one of the four CMSs, independent of the stromal contribution. We subsequently validate our CMS stratification by functional analysis which for instance shows mesenchymal enrichment in CMS4 and metabolic dysregulation in CMS3. Finally, we observe a clear difference in sensitivity to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, specifically between CMS2 and CMS4. This relates to the in vivo efficacy of chemotherapy, which delays outgrowth of CMS2, but not CMS4 xenografts. This indicates that molecular subtypes are faithfully modelled in the CRC cell cultures and PDXs, representing tumour cell intrinsic and stable features. This repository provides researchers with a platform to study CRC using the existing heterogeneity. Gene expression analysis of 15 CRC primary cell lines grown as spheroids.",

Previous analysis of Myf5-/-:MyoD-/- mouse fetuses lacking skeletal muscle demonstrated the importance of muscle contraction and static loading in mouse skeletogenesis. Among abnormal skeletal features, micrognathia (mandibular hypoplasia) was detected: small, bent and posteriorly displaced mandible. As an example of Waddingtonian epigenetics, we suggest that muscle, in addition to acting via mechanochemical signal transduction pathways, networks and promoters, also exerts secretory stimuli on skeleton. Our goal is to identify candidate molecules at that muscle-mandible interface. By employing Systematic Subtractive Microarray Analysis approach, we compared gene expression between mandibles of amyogenic and wild type mouse fetuses.We identified a set of candidate genes with involvement in mandibulardevelopment: Cacna1s, Ckm, Des, Mir300, Myog and Tnnc1. We also performed mouse-to-human translational experiments and found analogies.

Translational breast cancer research is hampered by difficulties in obtaining and studying primary human breast tissue, and by the lack of in vivo preclinical models that reflect patient tumor biology accurately. In an effort to overcome these limitations, we propagated a cohort of human breast tumors grown in the mammary fat pad of SCID/Beige and NOD/SCID/IL2?-receptor null (NSG) two relatively new immunocompromised mouse models, under a series of transplant conditions. Both models yielded stably transplantable xenografts relatively high rates compared with previously available immunocompromised mice. Xenograft lines were established directly from breast cancer patient samples, without intervening culture in vitro, using the epithelium-free mammary fat pad as the transplantation site. Of the conditions tested, xenograft take rate was highest in the presence of a low-dose estradiol pellet. Overall, 35 stably transplantable xenograft lines representing 27 patients were established, using pre-treatment, mid-treatment, and/or post-treatment samples. Most patients yielding xenografts were \"triple-negative\" (ER-PR-HER2-) (n=21).

Several studies have reported that iPSC retain an epigenetic memory from the tissue from which they were derived. However, the influence of the method used for reprogramming in the final pluripotent state has not been investigated yet. Therefore, we have taken advantage of germline stem cells (GSCs) that can be converted into germline pluripotent stem cells (gPSCs) using specific culture conditions or into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) after the forced expression of four transcription factors. Here, we compare the gene expression profile, imprinting methylation pattern and differentiation potential between GSC-derived iPSCs and gPSCs. Our analysis demonstrates that both reprogramming methods induce equivalent levels of pluripotency and that a donor GSC transcriptional memory is retained only at early steps after reprogramming. In summary, our results show that different reprogramming methods generate undistinguishable pluripotent states and exclude a method-dependent epigenetic memory.Cell Culture. All the cell lines used in this study were derived from OG2 mice. Unless otherwise noted, all cell culture reagents were purchased from Gibco or PAA. Neonatal GSCs derived from 10 days postpartum (d.p.p) murine testis and adult GSCs derived from 35 d.p.p murine testis were derived as previously described and cultured on irradiated C3H feeder cells in a medium composed of StemPro-34 SFM (including supplement), N2 supplement (1:100), 1 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 5 mg ml-1 bovine serum albumin (BSA) fraction V, 100 U ml-1 penicillin, 100 ug ml-1 streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids (NEAA), 0.1 mM b-mercaptoethanol, MEM vitamins (1:100), 6 mg ml-1 D-(+)-glucose (Sigma), 30 mg ml-1 pyruvic acid, 0.1 % DL-lactic acid (Sigma), 60 ng ml-1 progesterone (Sigma), 30 ng ml-1 b-estradiol (Sigma), 15 ng ml-1 mouse EGF (Peprotech), 10 ng ml-1 human bFGF (Peprotech), 10 ng ml-1 human GDNF (Peprotech), and 1000 U ml-1 mouse LIF (in-house preparation). For maintenance culture, GSCs were passaged at a 1:2-ratio once a week after digestion with 0.05 % trypsin/EDTA. In addition, ESCs, iPSC and gPSC were cultured on irradiated C3H feeders in the following medium: Knockout DMEM, 20% Knockout Serum Replacement, penicillin, streptomycin, L-glutamine, NEAA, b-mercaptoethanol, and LIF.Generation of pluripotent cell lines. iPSC were generated using tetracycline-inducible lentiviruses. For the lentiviral production, 293T cells were plated at 50 % confluency in 10-cm dishes one day prior to transfection. The next day, the lentiviral vector (3 ug) together with the packaging plasmids psPAX2 (2 ug) and pMD2.G (1 ug) (Addgene plasmids #12260 and #12259, respectively) were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h, viral-containing supernatants were filtered (0.45 um), concentrated around 30-fold by centrifugation (26,000 x g, 2 h, 4 degC) and stored at -80 degC. For the generation of iPSCs, a single-cell suspension of 50,000 GSCs was infected overnight with five tetracycline-inducible lentiviruses (5-20 ul concentrated supernatant each) encoding for Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, and the reverse tetracycline-transactivator M2-rtTA (Addgene plasmids #20323, #20326, #20322, #20324, and #20342) in the presence of 4 ug ml-1 polybrene (Sigma). One week after the infection, the expression of the viral transgenes was induced by adding 4 ug ml-1 doxycycline (Sigma) to the medium. MEFs-derived iPSCs were generated using the same protocol. gPSC were generated following a previous reported protocol. Briefly, GSCs were seeded at a density of approx. 1000 cells cm-2 on feeder cells and were not splitted until gPSC colonies were observed. Both iPSC and gPSC colonies were identified by Oct4-GFP expression, manually picked and expanded under ESC conditions. In vitro differentiation of pluripotent cells. Embryoid body (EB) formation was induced in suspension culture adopting the hanging drop method (600 cells in 20 ul) for 5 days in ESC medium without LIF. EBs were seeded on gelatine-coated plates and further cultured for 14 days in the same medium. Chimera formation. Aggregations of putative pluripotent cells with denuded 8-cell stage embryos were performed as previously reported. After overnight incubation at 37 degC and 5 % CO2, 11-14 aggregates were transferred into the uterine horns of 2.5 d.p.c pseudo-pregnant surrogate mothers (mated with vasectomized males). The chimeric pups were obtained and dissected at 14.5 d.p.c. Microarray gene expression analysis. Purified cRNA samples were prepared with the linear TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion) from 500 ng original RNA, involving synthesis of double-stranded cDNA by T7-promoter-linked oligo(dT) primers and 14 hours of in-vitro transcription incorporating biotin-labelled nucleotides. Hybridizations onto MouseRef 8 v2.0 Expression BeadChips (Illumina) was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Two replicates were hybridized from each sample. Chips were stained with streptavidin-Cy3 (GE Healthcare) and scanned using an iScan reader (Illumina). The bead intensities were mapped to gene information using BeadStudio 3.2 (Illumina). Background correction was performed using the Affymetrix robust multiarray analysis (RMA) background correction model. Variance stabilization was performed by log2 scaling, and gene expression normalization was calculated with the method implemented in the lumi package of R-Bioconductor.

High fat diet (HFD), if prolonged, leads to obesity thereby accelerating the development of many ageing-related pathologies including chronic inflammation, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and a higher predisposition to develop cancer. We asked whether HFD could reprogram the circadian output of young stem cells in a manner similar to what we observed during physiological ageing.HFD has been recently shown to induce a rewiring of the liver circadian transcriptome and metabolome, although in an obesity-independent manner. We therefore fed young (8 week old) C57Bl6 mice with HFD or its control diet for 7-weeks, a time when mice had not yet become obese, and performed circadian transcriptome analysis. Eight week old female C57B6/J mice were fed ad libitum either with high fat or with the respective control diet.

Maternal innate and adaptive immune responses are modulated during pregnancy to concurrently defend against infection and tolerate the semi-allogeneic fetus. The restoration of these systems after childbirth is poorly understood. We reasoned that enhanced innate immune activation may extend beyond gestation while adaptive immunity recovers. To test this hypothesis, the transcriptional profiles of total PBMCs following delivery in healthy women were compared to those of non-pregnant control subjects. Interestingly, interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) encoding proteins such as IFIT1, IFIT2, and IFIT3, as well as signaling proteins such as STAT1, STAT2, and MAVS, were enriched postpartum. Antiviral genes were primarily expressed in CD14+ cells and could be stratified according to genetic variation at the interferon-l3 gene (IFNL3, also named IL28B) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12979860. Antiviral gene expression was sustained beyond six months following delivery in mothers with a CT or TT genotype but resembled baseline non-pregnant control levels following delivery in mothers with a CC genotype. CT and TT IFNL3 genotypes have been associated with persistent elevated ISG expression in individuals chronically infected with hepatitis C virus. Together these data suggest that postpartum, the normalization of the physiological rheostat controlling interferon signaling is dependent on IFNL3 genotype. Two different analyses were performed: 1) Set1- Two non-pregnant controls (NPC 354 and 357) were compared against two patients post-partum (ID7 and ID8); 2) Set 2- Two non-pregnant controls (NPC 354 and 357) were compared against two patients post-partum (ID10 and ID12).",

Treatment of advanced V600BRAF mutant melanoma using a BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) or its combination with a MEKi typically elicits partial responses. We compared the transcriptomes of patient-derived tumors regressing on MAPKi therapy against MAPKi-induced temporal transcriptomic states in human melanoma cell lines or murine melanoma in immune-competent mice. Despite heterogeneous dynamics of clinical tumor regression, residual tumors displayed highly recurrent transcriptomic alterations and enriched processes, which were also observed in MAPKi-selected cell lines (implying tumor cell-intrinsic reprogramming) or in bulk mouse tumors (and the CD45-negative or -positive fractions,, implying tumor cell-intrinsic or stromal/immune alterations, respectively). Tumor cell-intrinsic reprogramming attenuated MAPK-dependency, while enhancing mesenchymal, angiogenic and IFN-inflammatory features and growth/survival dependence on multi-RTKs and PD-L2. In the immune compartment, PD-L2 upregulation in CD11c+ immunocytes drove the loss of T-cell inflammation and promoted BRAFi resistance. Thus, residual melanoma early on MAPKi therapy already displays potentially exploitable adaptive transcriptomic, epigenomic, immune-regulomic alterations.

    "text": "regulatory T cells in human pregnancy. Transplacental immune programming refers to the concept that during pregnancy, significant crosstalk occurs between the maternal and fetal immune system, with consequent long-term effects especially for the offspring. In this study, we searched for evidence of transplacental programming in cellular immunity. We made the surprising observation that there is a stringent and specific correlation of regulatory T cells (Treg) between the mother and the fetus. Gene microarray analysis indicates that interleukin 10 (IL-10) might be involved in transplacental Treg alignment. This is further supported by the direct correlation of IL-10 at a protein level between maternal fetal dyads. In vitro data provide evidence that IL-10 may regulate the homeostatic balance between Tregs and non-Tregs through selective upregulation of the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2 in Tregs. Induction of IL-10 might be triggered by fetus-derived estriol (E3), which readily crosses the placenta and correlates with maternal IL- 10 levels. Our study represents the first example of transplacental regulation of cellular immunity between the mother and the fetus. These novel findings might have major implications for pregnancy related-changes in the maternal and fetal immune system, and provide possible mechanistic insights into how prenatal influences can lead to subsequent immunopathologies, such as allergy and autoimmunity.

Brown adipose tissue is specialized to burn lipids for heat generation as a natural defense against cold and obesity. Previous studies established microRNAs as essential regulators of brown adipocyte differentiation, but it remains unknown whether microRNAs are required for the feature maintenance of mature brown adipocytes. To address this question, we ablated Dgcr8, a key regulator of the microRNA biogenesis pathway, in mature brown as well as white adipocytes. The adipose tissue -specific Dgcr8 knockout mice displayed enlarged but pale interscapular brown fat with decreased expression of genes characteristic of brown fat, and the mice were intolerant to cold exposure. In vitro primary brown adipocyte cultures confirmed that microRNAs are required for marker gene expression in mature brown adipocytes. We also demonstrated that microRNAs are essential for the browning of subcutaneous white adipocyte both in vitro and in vivo. Using this animal model, we performed microRNA expression profiling analysis and identified a set of BAT-specific microRNAs that are up-regulated during brown adipocyte differentiation and enriched in brown fat compared to other organs. We identified miR-182 and miR-203 as new regulators of brown adipocyte development. Taken together, our study demonstrates an essential role of microRNAs in the maintenance as well as the differentiation of brown adipocytes.

Understanding the interactions between tumors and the host immune system holds great promise to uncover biomarkers for targeted therapies, predict the prognosis of patients and guide clinical treatment. However, the immune signatures of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remain largely unstudied in terms of systematic analyses. We aimed to classify GBM samples according to immune-related genes and complement the existing immunotherapy system knowledge. In this study, we designed a strategy to identify 3 immune subtypes representing 3 different immune microenvironments (M1-M3) and associated with prognosis. The three subtypes were significantly different in terms of specific immune characteristics (immune cell subpopulations, immune responses, immune cells and checkpoint gene interactions). In additional, somatic alterations and methylation changes were identified that correlated with genes related to a worse prognosis subtype in the microenvironment. More importantly, in M3 (worst prognosis subtype) and M2 (best prognosis subtype), the interaction between immune cells and checkpoint genes was different, and this had an important effect on the prognosis. Finally, we used risk scores of immune cells and checkpoint genes to evaluate the prognosis of GBM patients and validated the results with 3 independent datasets. Disordered interactions between immune cells and checkpoint genes result in a change in the immune microenvironment and affects the prognosis of patients. We propose that a better understanding of the immune microenvironment of advanced cancers may provide new insights into immunotherapy. There are 89 samples.

Metastatic spread in Ewing Tumors (ET) is hematogenous and malignant features have been shown to correlate with hypoxia and angiogenesis. We identified several Ewing tumor specific genes (Staege MS et al. Cancer Res. 2004;64:8213-21). Microarray analysis confirmed an endothelial signature of this tumor and revealed the G-protein coupled receptor-64 (GPR64), an orphan receptor with normal expression restricted to human epididymis, to be highly induced in ET. Down-regulation of GPR64 in ET lines by RNA interference did not reduce their proliferative capacity in vitro as measured by plastic adherence dependent proliferation or contact independent growth in colony forming assays. Of interest inhibition of GPR64 expression in ET cell lines resulted in impaired endothelial differentiation in tube formation assays. Furthermore, GPR64 suppression substantially inhibited tumor growth and metastatic spread in immunodeficient Rag2-/-gammaC-/- mice. Microarray analysis of ET after GPR64 knock down revealed a GPR64-mediated induction of VEGF receptor 1 ligand placental growth factor (PGF) in ET. PGF itself was induced by EWS-FLI1 in mesenchymal stem cells. Repression of PGF expression in ET cell lines resulted in a similar phenotype as observed after GPR64 knockdown. GPR64 as well as PGF knock down correlated with a reduced proteolytic activity of Matrix Metalloproteinase MMP1 and invasiveness in vitro. MMP1 specific knock down resulted in the abrogation of metastasis of ET in Rag2-/-gammaC-/- mice. We conclude, that GPR64 and subsequent PGF up-regulation in ET orchestrate and promote endothelial invasiveness and metastatic spread and play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and aggressiveness of this tumor.

We found a strong association between the basal-like subtype and BRCA1-mutated breast tumors and the luminal B subtype and BRCA2-mutated breast tumors. RB1 was identified as a major target for genomic disruption in tumors arising in BRCA1 mutation carriers and in sporadic tumors with BRCA1 promoter-methylation, but rarely in other breast cancers.

Recently, we have shown that telomere elongation in cancer cells represses innate immune genes and promotes their differentiation in vivo. This implies that short telomeres contribute to cancer malignancy, but it is unclear how such genetic repression is caused by long telomeres. Here we report that telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) induces genome-wide alteration of gene expression in telomere-elongated cancer cells in vivo. Using three different cell lines, we found that telomere elongation upregulates TERRA and downregulates innate immune genes in vivo xenograft tumors. Most of the suppressed genes belonged to innate immune system categories and were upregulated in various cancers. We propose that TERRA G4 counteracts cancer malignancy through suppression of innate immune genes. Four samples are telomere-elongated cells (PC3/LhTERTL, PC3/LhTERTL/cre, HBC4/hTERT and MKN74/hTERT), and the other four samples are control cell lines.",

The SWI/SNF-family chromatin remodeling protein ATRX is a tumor suppressor in sarcomas, gliomas and other malignancies. Its loss of function facilitates the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway in tumor cells, while it also affects Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) silencing of its target genes. To further define the role of inactivating ATRX mutations in carcinogenesis, we knocked out atrx in our previously published p53/nf1-deficient zebrafish line that develops malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and gliomas. Complete inactivation of atrx using CRISPR-cas9 was lethal in developing fish and resulted in an alpha-thalassemia-like phenotype including reduced alpha-globin expression. In p53/nf1-deficient zebrafish neither peripheral nerve sheath tumors nor gliomas showed accelerated onset in atrx+/- fish, but these fish developed various tumors that were not observed in their atrx+/+ siblings, including epithelioid sarcoma, angiosarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and rare types of carcinoma. Most of these cancer types are included in the AACR Genie database of human tumors associated with mutant ATRX, indicating that our zebrafish model reliably reflects a role for ATRX-loss in the early pathogenesis of these types of human cancers. RNA-seq of p53/nf1- and p53/nf1/atrx-deficient tumors revealed that down-regulation of telomerase accompanied ALT-mediated lengthening of the telomeres in atrx-mutant samples. Moreover, inactivating mutations in atrx disturbed PRC2-target gene silencing, indicating a connection between ATRX loss and PRC2 dysfunction in cancer development. Gene expression values were derived from paired end RNA-Seq data that compared zebrafish samples from p53/nf1/atrx-deficient tumors to samples from atrx-wildtype controls (3 vs. 3 samples).",

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), leukemia stem cells (LSCs) play a central role in disease progression and recurrence due to their intrinsic capacity for self-renewal and chemotherapy resistance. Whereas epigenetic regulation balances normal blood stem cell self-renewal and fate decisions, mutation and dysregulation of epigenetic modifiers are now considered fundamental to leukemia initiation and progression. Alterations in miRNA function represent a non-canonical epigenetic mechanism influencing malignant hematopoiesis; however, the function of miRNA in LSC remains undetermined. Here we show that miRNA profiling of fractionated AML populations defines an LSC-specific signature that is highly predictive of patient survival. Gain-of-function genetic analysis demonstrated that miR-126 restrained cell cycle progression, prevented LSC differentiation, and increased LSC self-renewal. miR-126 promoted chemo-resistance, preserving LSC quiescence in part through suppression of the G0-to-G1 gatekeeper, CDK3. Thus, in AML, miRNAs influence patient outcome through post-transcriptional regulation of stemness programs in LSC. Total RNA was extracted from 8227 cells and treated with miR-126 sponge or miR-126-containing viral particles (and corresponding controls).",

Mouse has been regarded as an effective tool to explore the roles of miRNAs in hippocampus. Although the anatomical structure and physiological function across human and mouse hippocampi are highly conserved, the similarity and difference of hippocampal miRNAomes between the two species have not been well characterized. Our present study represents the first attempt to perform a systematic comparison of the miRNAomes between healthy human and mouse hippocampi using high-throughput sequencing followed by bioinformatic analyses. Contrasting between human and mouse hippocampal miRNAs shows a global similarity of expression pattern; however, the interspecific expression conservation of hippocampal miRNAs is positively associated with the interspecific sequence conservation. Although the type of the abundantly expressed hippocampal miRNAs is almost the same across the two species, only the enriched miRNAs in human hippocampus exhibit potential neuro-related activities. In addition, we also identified a novel miRNA and a species-specific miRNA in human hippocampus whose putative targets are associated with neuro-related activities. Collectively, our results can provide a framework to explore the ability of mice to model the physiological and pathological processes of human hippocampus and also aid in understanding the basis for higher order abilities of learning and memory at the miRNA level. Total RNA from frozen hippocampi (7 humans and 7 mice) was purified using Trizol (Invitrogen, USA) protocol with no modifications.

Glucose transporters are the first and rate-limiting step for cellular glucose usage, which is often exacerbated in tumour cells enabling their growth and proliferation. Although inhibiting glucose metabolism in lung tumours could become an efficient treatment strategy, whether and which glucose transporter(s) should be targeted remains unclear because of their possible functional redundancy, and because other nutrients or transporter-independent metabolic processes including autophagy and macropinocytosis can fuel tumour cell growth in certain contexts. Here we show that glucose transporter Glut1 gene deletion in tumour cells does not impact tumour initiation and only slightly delays progression in a genetically-engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. Using 13C-glucose tracing with correlated nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) and electron microscopy, we report the presence of multiple lamellar body-like organelles produced by tumour cells. Glucose-derived biomass accumulates in these organelles, and this accumulation is decreased in Glut1-deficient tumour cells. Ex vivo, tumour cell glycolysis is impaired in absence of Glut1 except in case of strong expression of another glucose transporter, Glut3. We show that Glut3 is dispensable for Glut1 wild-type tumour development. In contrast, their combined deletion diminishes tumour growth and prevents the appearance of big lesions. Our results demonstrate the requirement for two glucose transporters in lung adenocarcinoma; dual blockade could reach therapeutic responses not achieved by individual targeting.

The mechanisms underlying the neurodevelopmental deficits associated with the syndrome, which include cerebellar hypoplasia, developmental delay, coordination problems and autistic features, are not known. CHD7 is expressed in neural stem and progenitor cells, but its role in neurogenesis during brain development remains unknown. Here we show that deletion of Chd7 from cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCps) in the mouse results in reduced GCp proliferation, cerebellar hypoplasia, developmental delay and motor deficits. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed downregulated Reln gene expression in Chd7-deficient GCps. Recessive RELN mutations is associated with severe cerebellar hypoplasia in humans. We provide molecular and genetic evidence that reduced Reln expression contributes substantially to the GCp proliferative defect and cerebellar hypoplasia in GCp-specific Chd7 mouse mutants. Finally, we show that CHD7 is necessary for the maintenance of an open, accessible chromatin state at the Reln locus. Taken together, this study shows that Reln gene expression is regulated by chromatin remodeling, identifies CHD7 as a previously unrecognized upstream regulator of Reln and provides the first evidence that a mammalian CHD protein controls brain development by modulating chromatin accessibility in neuronal progenitors in vivo.

Protection of the human respiratory system from exposure of volatile nanoparticles has become an emerging health concern. The understanding of the biological processes involved in the development and maintenance of a variety of pathologies is improved by genome-wide approaches. Technical feasibility of this type of experiment has perfected in recent years, but data analysis remains challenging. In this context, gene set analysis has emerged as a fundamental tool for the interpretation of the results. We demonstrate how the use of a combination of gene-by-gene and gene set analyses can enhance the interpretation of results. Gene set analyses are able to distinguish responses due to nanoparticle size also discriminating between long and short time recovery after exposure. Transcription regulation and cell proliferation modulation appear to be an early response while oxidative stress and mitochondrial perturbation are late response. Moreover, smaller the particle higher the effect on inflammatory response and DNA damage activation.

Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are hormone-regulated transcription factors that regulate a diverse array of biological activities, including metabolism, homeostasis, and development. TRs also serve as tumor suppressors, and aberrant TR function (via mutation, deletion, or altered expression) is associated with a spectrum of both neoplastic and endocrine diseases. A particularly high frequency of TR mutations has been reported in renal clear cell carcinoma (RCCC) and in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We have shown that HCC-TR mutants regulate only a fraction of the genes targeted by wild-type TRs, but have gained the ability to regulate other, unique, targets. We have suggested that this altered gene recognition may contribute to the neoplastic phenotype. Here, to determine the generality of this phenomenon, we examined a distinct set of TR mutants associated with RCCCs. We report that two different TR mutants, isolated from independent RCCC tumors, possess greatly expanded target gene specificities that extensively overlap one another, but only minimally overlap that of the WT-TRs, or those of two HCC-TR mutants. Many of the genes targeted by either or both RCCC-TR mutants have been previously implicated in RCCC, and include a series of metallothioneins, solute carriers, and genes involved in glycolysis and energy metabolism. We propose that TR mutations from RCCC and HCC are likely to play tissue-specific roles in carcinogenesis, and that the divergent target gene recognition patterns of TR mutants isolated from the two different types of tumors arises from different selective pressures during development of RCCC versus HCC. Gene expression was analyzed in HepG2 transformants expressing ectopic wildtype THRA, wildtype THRB, HCC-TR mutants aI and bN, and RCCC-TR mutants 6a and 15b using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays in the presence or absence of T3.

We have combined the results of different genomic and expression array platforms on matched samples of sun-exposed skin, AK and cSCC from ten immunocompetent patients, with the objective of better understanding the mechanisms involved in this progression. Gene expression analysis and copy number alterations were assessed using GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array(r) (Affymetrix ) and CytoScan HD Cytogenetics Solution(r) (Affymetrix) platforms, respectively. Integration of genome and transcriptome results was evaluated using the DR-Integrator tool. Additional studies (qPCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blot) were performed for selected genes. Twenty-two genes showed a progressive expression spectrum from clinically normal sun-exposed skin samples to cSCC. FOSL1 and BNC1 encode transcription factors whose expression was increased in cSCC in the expression array and the qPCR. By immunohistochemistry, FOSL1 showed an intense staining at the invasive front of cSCC samples and BNC1 expression varied from a nuclear location (sun-exposed skin) to a cytoplasmic location (cSCC). Western blot analyses confirmed the enhancement of FOSL1 and BNC1 expression. Additionally, the smallest overlapping regions of genomic imbalance (SORIs) involving at least 3 of the samples of each group (sun-exposed skin, AK or cSCC) were selected. One of the SORIs was a deletion in the p24.1 band of chromosome 3, shared by 7 of the cSCC. A strong correlation in the integration analysis was found for NEK10, a gene contained in the previously mentioned SORI. Loss of NEK10 expression in cSCC was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses. In conclusion, our findings suggest that FOSL1 may play a role in promoting the cSCC invasion ability.

Here, we discovered that LATS2 knockout causes dysregulation of PRC2 and subsequent transcriptome changes for differentiation in both mouse and human cells. LATS2 depletion dependent dysregulation of PRC2 also effects H3K4me3 and forms negative feedback loop for maintenance of PRC2.

Exogenous pyruvate modulates metabolism, provides cellular protection, and is essential for the maintenance of human preimplantation embryos and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). However, little is known about how pyruvate contributes to cell fate determination during epiblast stage. In this study, we used hESCs as a model to demonstrate that elevated exogenous pyruvate shifts metabolic balance towards oxidative phosphorylation in both maintenance and differentiation conditions. During differentiation, pyruvate potentiates mesoderm and endoderm lineage specification. Pyruvate production and its mitochondrial metabolism are required in BMP4-induced mesoderm differentiation. However, the TCA cycle metabolites do not have the same effect as pyruvate on differentiation. Further study shows that pyruvate increases AMP/ATP ratio, activates AMPK, and then modulates the mTOR pathway to enhance mesoderm differentiation. This study reveals that exogenous pyruvate not only controls metabolism, but also modulates signaling pathways in hESC differentiation. Total RNA obtained from H1 human embryonic stem cell (hESC) culture in E8 medium (E8_2 Days), E8 medium with Pyruvate 16 mM treatment (Pyr 16mM_2 Days); HESCs were treated with BMP4 for 2 or 6 days for mesoderm differentiation in E8 medium, BMP4 treated for 2 days (BMP4_2 Days), BMP4 treatment with Pyruvate 16mM for 2 days (BMP4+Pyr 16mM_2 Days) or for 6 days (BMP4+Pyr 16mM_6 Days).",

In both NOD mice and humans, the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is dependent in part on autoreactive CD8+ T-cells recognizing pancreatic ss-cell peptides presented by often quite common MHC class I variants. Studies in NOD mice previously revealed the common H2-Kd and/or H2-Db class I molecules expressed by this strain acquire an aberrant ability to mediate pathogenic CD8 T-cell responses through interactions with T1D susceptibility (Idd) genes outside the MHC. A gene(s) mapping to the Idd7 locus on proximal Chromosome 7 was previously shown to be an important contributor to the failure of the common class I molecules expressed by NOD mice to mediate the normal thymic negative selection of diabetogenic CD8+ T-cells. Using an inducible model of thymic negative selection and mRNA transcript analyses we initially identified an elevated Nfkbid expression variant as a strong candidate for an NOD Idd7 region gene contributing to impaired thymic deletion of diabetogenic CD8+ T-cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic attenuation of Nfkbid expression in NOD mice resulted in improved negative selection of autoreactive diabetogenic AI4 and NY8.3 CD8+ T-cells. These results indicated allelic variants of Nfkbid represent an Idd7 gene contributing to the efficiency of intrathymic deletion of diabetogenic CD8+ T-cells. However, while enhancing thymic deletion of pathogenic CD8+ T-cells, ablation of Nfkbid expression surprisingly accelerated T1D onset in NOD mice likely by numerically decreasing regulatory T- and B-lymphocytes (Tregs/Bregs), thereby reducing their peripheral immunosuppressive effects.We used microarray analysis to identify differentialy expressed genes in thymus under conditions of induced thymic negative selection. We compare two mice strains, NOD-LCMV vs NOD.Ln82-LCMV (a congenic stock for a C57BL/6 derived segment delimited by markers D7Mit117-D7Mit247).

The transcription factors Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2 are the master regulators of pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), however, their functions in human ESCs (hESCs) have not been rigorously defined. Here we show that the requirements for NANOG, OCT4 and SOX2 in hESCs differ from those in mESCs. Both NANOG and OCT4 are required for self-renewal and repress differentiation. OCT4 controls both extraembryonic and epiblast-derived cell fates in a BMP4-dependent manner. OCT4-depleted hESCs commit to trophectoderm and primitive endoderm in the presence of BMP4, but undergo neuroectoderm differentiation in the absence of BMP4. NANOG represses neuroectoderm and neural crest commitment, but has little or no effect on the other lineages. We find that SOX2 is not required for self-renewal because it is redundant with SOX3, which is induced in SOX2-depleted hESCs. Simultaneous depletion of both SOX2 and SOX3 induces differentiation into the primitive streak. Unexpectedly, we identify significant variability in the usage of pluripotency factors by individual hESC lines, suggesting that the pluripotency network is remodelled to support a continuum of developmental states. Our study revises the general view of how NANOG, OCT4 and SOX2 orchestrate self-renewal in hESCs. Total RNA obtained from SOX2-KD stable hESC clones and H1P control stable hESC clones.",

Noonan syndrome (NS) is caused by mutations in RAS/ERK pathway genes, and is characterized by craniofacial, growth, cognitive and cardiac defects. NS patients with kinase-activating RAF1 alleles typically develop pathological left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), which is reproduced in Raf1 L613V/+ knock-in mice. Here, using inducible Raf1 L613V expression, we show that LVH results from the interplay of cardiac cell types. Cardiomyocyte Raf1 L613V enhances Ca 2+ sensitivity and cardiac contractility without causing hypertrophy. Raf1 L613V expression in cardiomyocytes or activated fibroblasts exacerbates pressure overload-evoked fibrosis. Endothelial/endocardial (EC) Raf1 L613V causes cardiac hypertrophy without affecting contractility. Co-culture and neutralizing antibody experiments reveal a cytokine hierarchy (TNFa->IL6) from Raf1 L613V -expressing ECs that drives cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro. Furthermore, post-natal TNFa inhibition normalizes the increased wall thickness and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vivo. We conclude that NS cardiomyopathy involves cardiomyocytes, ECs, and fibroblasts, TNFa/IL6 signaling components represent potential therapeutic targets, and abnormal EC signaling might contribute to other forms of LVH. control vs. Raf1 L613V/+ knock-in cardiomyocytes.",

Methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me) at actively expressed, cell type-specific genes is established during development by the Trithorax group of epigenetic regulators. In mammals, the Trithorax family includes KMT2A-D (MLL1-4), a family of SET domain proteins that function in large complexes to impart mono-, di-, and trimethylation at H3K4. Individual KMT2s and their co-factors are essential for embryonic development and the establishment of correct gene expression patterns, presumably by demarcating the active and accessible regions of the genome in a cell specific and heritable manner. Despite the importance of H3K4me marks in development, little is known about the importance of histone methylation in maintaining gene expression patterns in fully differentiated and non-dividing cell types. In this report, we utilized an inducible cardiac-specific Cre driver to delete the PTIP protein, a key component of a H3K4me complex, and ask whether this activity is still required to maintain the phenotype of terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes. Our results demonstrate that reducing the H3K4me3 marks is sufficient to alter gene expression patterns and significantly augment systolic heart function. These results clearly show that maintenance of H3K4me3 marks is necessary for the stability of the transcriptional program in differentiated cells. The array we performed allowed us to identify genes that are regulated by PTIP and histone methylation. 8-week-old littermate mice on a mixed C57B6 and B6129 background were utilized. Three mice were on a background with a PTIP floxed allele and a wild type PTIP allele (PTIP+1, PTIP+2, PTIP+3). Three mice had a transgene that expresses a modified estrogen receptor -Cre recombinase fusion protein under the control of a cardiac-specific driver (alpha myosin heavy chain, Jackson Lab stock #005650) and a floxed PTIP allele and a null PTIP (PTIPKO1, PTIPKO2, PTIPKO3). Both groups of mice were injected with tamoxifen at 8 weeks of age. Tamoxifen deletes the floxed PTIP allele in the PTIPKO mice. 5 days after tamoxifen injection, RNA was harvested from left ventricle (LV) apices in both groups.

Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is an aggressive form of ovarian cancer with high ARID1A mutation rates. Here we present a genetically engineered mouse model of OCCC. We find that ARID1A inactivation is not sufficient for tumor formation, but requires concurrent activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase catalytic subunit, PIK3CA. Remarkably, the mice develop highly penetrant tumors with OCCC-like histopathology, culminating in hemorrhagic ascites and a median survival period of 7.5 weeks. Therapeutic treatment with the pan-PI3K inhibitor, BKM120, prolonged mouse survival by inhibiting tumor cell growth. Cross-species gene expression comparisons support a role for IL-6 inflammatory cytokine signaling in OCCC pathogenesis. We further show that ARID1A-PIK3CA mutations cooperate to promote tumor growth through sustained IL-6 overproduction. Our findings establish an epistatic relationship between SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling and PI3K pathway mutations in OCCC and demonstrate that these pathways converge on pro-tumorigenic cytokine signaling.

Circulating levels of the gut microbe-derived metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide(TMAO) have recently been linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Here we performed transcriptional profiling in mouse models of altered reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), and serendipitously identified the TMAO-generating enzyme flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) as a powerful modifier of cholesterol metabolism and RCT. Knockdown of FMO3 in cholesterol-fed mice alters biliary lipid secretion, blunts intestinal cholesterol absorption, and limits the production of hepatic oxysterols and cholesteryl esters. Furthermore, FMO3 knockdown stimulates basal and liver X receptor (LXR)-stimulated macrophage RCT, thereby improving cholesterol balance. Conversely, FMO3 knockdown exacerbates hepatic ER stress and inflammation in part by decreasing hepatic oxysterol levels and subsequent LXR activation. FMO3 is thus identified as a central integrator of hepatic cholesterol and triacylglycerol metabolism, inflammation, and ER stress. These studies suggest that the gut microbiota-driven TMA/FMO3/TMAO pathway is a key regulator of lipid metabolism and inflammation. To identify potential regulators of macrophage reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), liver was isolated from two independent mouse models where the non-biliary RCT pathway known as transintestinal cholesterol excretion (TICE) was either chronically (NPC1L1-liver-transgenic mice) or acutely (ACAT2 antisense oligonucleotide treatment) stimulated.

Introduction: Glioma stem cells isolated from human glioblastomas are resistant to radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy and may drive tumor recurrence. Treatment efficacy may depend on the presence of glioma stem cells, expression of DNA repair enzymes such as methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT), or transcriptome subtype. Methods: To model genetic alterations in the core signaling pathways of human glioblastoma, we induced conditional Rb knockout, Kras activation, and Pten deletion mutations in cortical murine astrocytes. Serial neurosphere culture, multi-lineage differentiation, and orthotopic transplantation were used to assess whether these mutations induced de-differentiation of cortical astrocytes into glioma stem cells. Efficacy of radiation and temozolomide was examined in vitro and in an allograft model in vivo. The effects of radiation on transcriptome subtype was examined by expression profiling. Results: G1/S-defective, Rb knockout astrocytes gained unlimited self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation capacity, in both the presence and absence of Kras and Pten mutations. Only triple mutant astrocytes formed serially-transplantable glioblastoma allografts. Triple mutant astrocytes and allografts were sensitive to radiation, but expressed Mgmt and were resistant to temozolomide. Radiation induced a shift in transcriptome subtype of glioblastoma allografts from proneural to mesenchymal. Conclusion: A defined set of core signaling pathway mutations induces de-differentiation of cortical murine astrocytes into glioma stem cells. This non-germline genetically engineered mouse model mimics human proneural glioblastoma on histopathological, molecular, and treatment response levels. It may be useful in dissecting the genetic and cellular mechanisms of treatment resistance and developing more effective therapies.

Supranormal levels of aldosterone are associated with increased cardiovascular risk in humans, and with accelerated atherosclerosis in animal models. Atherosclerosis is a low-grade inflammatory disorder, with monocyte-derived macrophages as major drivers of plaque formation. Monocytes can adopt a long-term pro-inflammatory phenotype after brief stimulation with microbial pathogens or endogenous atherogenic lipoproteins via a process termed trained immunity. Using a primary human in vitro model, we demonstrate that aldosterone induces trained immunity via the mineralocorticoid receptor. We identify fatty acid synthesis as a crucial pathway necessary for the induction of trained immunity in monocyte-derived macrophages and demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of this pathway blunts aldosterone-induced trained immunity. At the level of gene regulation, aldosterone promotes enrichment of the transcriptionally-permissive H3K4me3 modification at promoters of genes central to the fatty acid synthesis pathway. These data provide mechanistic insight into the contribution of aldosterone to inflammation, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. After isolation, human monocyte-derived macrophages were stimulated (trained) with aldosterone (10nM) or vehicle (ethanol) for 24h, which was followed by a resting period of 5 days in medium.

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is caused by insufficient epigenetic repression of D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat where DUX4, an FSHD causing gene is embedded. There are two forms of FSHD, FSHD1 with contraction of D4Z4 repeat and FSHD2 with chromatin compaction defects mostly due to SMCHD1 mutation. Previous reports showed DUX4-induced gene expression changes as well as changes in microRNA expression in FSHD muscle cells. However, a genome wide analysis of small noncoding RNAs that might be regulated by DUX4 or by mutations in SMCHD1 has not been reported yet. Here, we identified several types of small noncoding RNAs including known microRNAs that are differentially expressed in FSHD2 muscle cells compared to control. Although fewer small RNAs were differentially expressed during muscle differentiation in FSHD2 cells compared to controls, most of the known myogenic microRNAs, such as miR1, miR133a, and miR206 were induced in both FSHD2 and control muscle cells during differentiation. Our small RNA sequencing data analysis also revealed both DUX4- and SMCHD1-specific changes in FSHD2 muscle cells. Six FSHD2 microRNAs were affected by DUX4 overexpression in control myoblasts, whereas increased expression of tRNAs and 5S rRNAs in FSHD2 muscle cells was largely recapitulated in SMCHD1-depleted control myoblasts.

Accordingly, labeled CoRL were sorted from individual young (2m) and aged (27m) male and female Ren1cCre|ZsGreen reporter mice, and their transcriptomic profiles analyzed by RNA seq.

In addition to marked differences in individual genes between aged female and male mice, gene ontology analysis showed major pathway differences by sex.

Innate immune system is essential for the immune surveillance of inner and outer threats, initial host defense responses and immune modulation. The role of natural drug compounds, including E. fischeriana, in innate immune regulation is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that E. fischeriana compound Dpo is involved in antiviral signaling. The genome wide RNA-seq analysis revealed that Dpo synergized the induction of ISGs by viral infection. Consistently, Dpo enhanced the antiviral immune responses and protected the mice from death during viral infection. Dpo however was not able to rescue STING deficient mice lethality caused by HSV-1 infection. The enhancement of ISG15 by Dpo was also impaired in STING, IRF3, IRF7 or ELF4 deficient cells, demonstrating that Dpo activates innate immune responses in a STING/IRFs/ELF4 dependent way. The STING/IRFs/ELF4 axis is therefore important for Dpo induced ISGs expression, and can be used by host to counteract infection. immortallized bone marrow derived macrophages were treated with medium (control) or Dpo at a concentration of 8ng/ul for 12 hours (Dpo)before harvest for RNA extraction.",

Profound changes in cancer cell identity can alter malignant potential and therapeutic response. Loss of the pulmonary lineage specifier NKX2-1 augments the growth of KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma and causes pulmonary to gastric transdifferentiation. Here we show that the transcription factors FoxA1 and FoxA2 are required for initiation of mucinous NKX2-1-negative lung adenocarcinomas in the mouse and for activation of their gastric differentiation program. Foxa1/2 deletion severely impairs tumor initiation and causes a proximal shift in cellular identity, yielding tumors expressing markers of the squamocolumnar junction of the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, stochastic loss of FoxA1/2 expression in NKX2-1-negative tumors is associated with keratinizing squamous differentiation. Using sequential in vivo recombination, we find that FoxA1/2 loss in established KRAS-driven neoplasia is sufficient for direct induction of keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas in the lung. Thus, NKX2-1, FoxA1 and FoxA2 coordinately regulate the growth and identity of lung adenocarcinoma in a context-specific manner.

Publication abstract: An incomplete view of the (epi)genetic events that drive melanoma initiation and progression has been a major barrier to rational development of effective therapeutics and prognostic diagnostics for melanoma patients. Recent approaches that integrate human melanoma genomic and transcriptomic data provide unprecedented opportunities to discover oncogenic melanoma drivers. One limitation, however, is that human melanoma genome exhibits a radically altered cytogenetic profile. There is therefore the need for biologically-meaningful approaches to identify and validate lesions that drive melanomagenesis. We combined comparative oncogenomic approaches with mouse modeling to identify new cancer genes/pathways that drive melanoma progression. Spontaneously acquired genetic alterations such as copy-number alterations and specific mutations in mouse tumors of defined genetic origin were identified and used to prioritize relevant lesions from the complex human melanoma genomes. This integrated effort confirmed the importance of several genes and pathways previously implicated in melanoma and identified new putative melanoma tumor suppressor genes. Genetic ablation of one such gene, c-Fes, cooperated with BRafv600E to accelerate melanomagenesis in mice. This comparative oncogenomic approach has therefore helped discover a series of novel melanoma tumor suppressor genes, including c-FES, with prognostic and therapeutic relevance in human melanoma.

In an effort to direct clinical use of Src inhibitors, we tested the effectiveness of one of the four Src inhibitors in clinical testing, SKI-606 (bosutinib), in the MMTV-PyVmT transgenic mouse model of breast cancer. Tumor formation in this model is dependent on the presence of Src, but the necessity of Src kinase activity for tumor formation has not been determined.

Myocardial infarction (MI) leads to cardiomyocyte death, which triggers an immune response that clears debris and restores tissue integrity. In the adult heart, the immune system facilitates scar formation, which repairs the damaged myocardium but compromises cardiac function. In neonatal mice, the heart can regenerate fully without scarring following MI; however, this regenerative capacity is lost by P7. The signals that govern neonatal heart regeneration are unknown. By comparing the immune response to MI in mice at P1 and P14, we identified differences in the magnitude and kinetics of monocyte and macrophage responses to injury. Using a cell-depletion model, we determined that heart regeneration and neoangiogenesis following MI depends on neonatal macrophages. Neonates depleted of macrophages were unable to regenerate myocardia and formed fibrotic scars, resulting in reduced cardiac function and angiogenesis. Immunophenotyping and gene expression profiling of cardiac macrophages from regenerating and nonregenerating hearts indicated that regenerative macrophages have a unique polarization phenotype and secrete numerous soluble factors that may facilitate the formation of new myocardium. Our findings suggest that macrophages provide necessary signals to drive angiogenesis and regeneration of the neonatal mouse heart. Modulating inflammation may provide a key therapeutic strategy to support heart regeneration.

Targeted therapies have the potential to revolutionize cancer care by providing personalized treatment strategies that are less toxic and more effective but it is clear that for most solid tumors suppression of a single target is not sufficient to prevent development of resistance. A powerful method to identify mechanisms of resistance and targets for combination therapy is to use an in vivo genetic approach. We have developed a novel retroviral gene delivery mouse model of melanoma that permits control of gene expression post-delivery using the tetracycline (tet)-regulated system. In this study we used this melanoma model to select for resistant tumors following genetic inhibition of mutant NRAS. Analysis of tumors that became resistant to NRAS suppression revealed that the most common mechanism of resistance was overexpression of the Met receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). Importantly, inhibition of Met overcomes NRAS resistance in this context. Analysis of NRAS mutant human melanoma cells revealed that inhibition of MEK is also associated with adaptive RTK signaling. Furthermore, co-inhibition of RTK signaling and MEK overcomes acquired MEK inhibitor resistance in NRAS mutant melanoma. These data suggest that combined inhibition of RTK and MEK signaling is a rational therapeutic strategy in mutant NRAS driven melanoma. Reversible NRAS Q61R expression in the melanocytes of DCT-TVA;Ink4a/Arf lox/lox mice (FVB/n) was achieved by transducing the animals with Tet-off and TRE-NRASQ61R-IRES-Cre avian leukosis viruses.

The cardinal clinical features of Parkinson's disease (PD) (rigidity, rest tremor, bradykinesia, and postural instability) result from selective loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. More specifically, dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are much more susceptible to damage than the adjacent dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). This dichotomy is not only seen in human Parkinsons disease, but also in many animal models of PD, including administration of the mitochondrial toxin rotenone to rats, which replicates many of the behavioral and neuropathological features of PD. The factors underlying this selective vulnerability are unknown, but could be related to differences in neuronal circuitry, differences in glial support, or intrinsic differences between the neuronal populations of the two regions. Elucidation of these factors may lead to a greater understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of Parkinson's disease.We will determine gene expression profiles of untreated rat SNc and VTA dopaminergic neurons using laser capture microscopy to obtain region-specific neuronal mRNA.There are intrinsic differences in gene expression between dopaminergic neurons in the rat SNc and VTA that result in greater susceptibility of SNc neurons to degeneration in experimental parkinsonism. These differences may be related to dopamine metabolism, oxidative metabolism and stress, protein aggregation, or other unforseen pathways.We will compare gene expression profiles between SNc and VTA dopaminergic neurons in normal rats. No treatment or time points will be studied in this experiment. Animals will be anesthetized, sacrificed by decapitation, and brains frozen on dry ice. Frozen sections will be collected onto glass microscope slides and rapidly immunostained for tyrosine hydroxylase to identify dopaminergic neurons.

With current therapy protocols up to 90 % of patients can be cured, but there is still a need to improve therapy for patients with aggressive WT and to reduce treatment intensity where possible. Prior data suggested deregulation of the retinoic acid (RA) pathway in high-risk WT. This could be validated in a large independent tumor set. Reduced RA pathway activity and MYCN overexpression were found in high risk tumors as opposed to tumors with low/intermediate risk, suggesting a beneficial impact of RA on advanced WT. To investigate the possible mode of action of retinoids as a novel therapeutic agent we treated primary tumor cell cultures with all-trans-RA (ATRA), 9cis-RA, fenretinide and combinations of retinoids and a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. Genes deregulated in high risk tumors showed opposite changes upon treatment suggesting a positive effect of retinoids. 6/7 primary cultures tested reduced proliferation, irrespective of prior RA signaling levels.

ATRA and 9cis-RA induced morphological changes suggestive of differentiation, while fenretinide induced apoptosis in several cultures tested. Microarray analysis of ATRA treated WT cells revealed differential expression of many genes involved in extracellular matrix formation and osteogenic, neuronal or muscle differentiation.

There are limited studies attempting to correlate the expression changes in oral squamous cell carcinoma with clinically relevant variables. We determined the gene expression profile of 16 tumor and 4 normal tissues from 16 patients by means of Affymetrix Hu133A GeneChips. The hybridized RNA was isolated from cells obtained with laser capture microdissection, then was amplified and labeled using T7 polymerase-based in vitro transcription. The expression of 53 genes was found to differ significantly (33 upregulated, 20 downregulated) in normal versus tumor tissues under two independent statistical methods. The expression changes in four selected genes (LGALS1, MMP1, LAGY, and KRT4) were confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Two-dimensional hierarchical clustering of the 53 genes resulted in the samples clustering according to the extent of tumor infiltration: normal epithelial tissue, tumors less than or equal to 4 cm in dimension, and tumors more than 4 cm in dimension (P=0.0014). The same pattern of clustering was also observed for the 20 downregulated genes. We did not observe any associations with lymph node metastasis (P=0.097).Keywords: TNM,Tumor-node-metastasis LCM,Laser capture microdissection OSCC,Oral squamous cell Carcinoma.

The presence or absence of lymph node metastasis plays a major role in the prediction of prognosis and subsequent patient management. However, good proportion of patients who display lymph node positivity remain disease free for 3 years or more, after the initial treatment, while a third of those who were lymph node negative at presentation, develop distant metastasis within the same period. We performed gene expression profiling on a cohort Indian breast cancer patients followed up for a period of 3-5 years and in comparison with a previously published Caucasian cohort data, we identified gene signatures that are associated with distant metastasis. This association was irrespective of the hormone receptor status. Our results show that the genes that signify immune system development and response are repressed, while factors for DNA replication are up regulated in patients who develop distant metastasis. A large number of genes encoding proteins involved in the mitotic spindle formation that belong to the TRIM28 protein network, are differentially regulated in the metastatic tumors. Also, there was a significant overlap of genes reported in a mouse model of bone metastasis, with patients who developed bone metastasis in our cohort. In conclusion, we present for the first time probable gene signatures that correlate with distant metastasis in breast cancer patients irrespective of nodal or hormone receptor status. 80 indian breast cancer patients(samples),comprising of 22ER+(estrogen receptor),and 55 ER-.PR(progesterone receptor) ,HER and NOD status are also given in corresponding sample title and array files.",

In a subgroup of patients with NAFLD inflammation and fibrosis develops, this so-called Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A multi-hit hypothesis has been proposed in which during the first \"hit\" fat accumulation occurs in hepatocytes from excessive delivery of fatty acids from adipose tissue, in addition there is an imbalance in lipid synthesis and export. However, the reason why fat accumulation is subsequently followed by inflammation and fibrosis in some patients is poorly understood.

Currently, the therapeutic prospects for cirrhosis patients are limited to liver transplantation and, therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new therapeutic strategies for improved treatments. Cirrhosis was induced in male Wistar rats with CCl4 treatment, and RNA from the complete livers was extracted and quantified through microarray experiments. Angiopoietins signalling is a key pathway in blood vessel normalization. Angiopoietin 1 (Ang1)-Tie2 signalling stabilizes blood vessels, Angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) on the other hand is a context-dependent antagonist of Ang1 and decreases its stabilizing effect giving rise to immature blood vessels. Cirrhotic conditions are characterized by higher expression and activity of Ang2 than healthy conditions, resulting in the loss of blood vessels stability. Previous work showed that inhibition of Ang2 via CVX-060 enhances Ang1-Tie2 signalling, and can stabilize the vascular system in cirrhotic livers. We therefore performed RNA extraction after treatment of cirrhotic rats with CVX-060 during 4 weeks. We observed changes in expression state (expressed/not expressed) in key transcription factors previously implicated in cirrhosis. To induce cirrhosis, male Wistar rats were exposed to inhalation of CCl4, as previously described. Five cirrhotic rats were treated once a week with 10 mg/kg of CVX-060 (Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY, USA) for 4 weeks.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can be obtained from several sources and the significant differences in their properties, makes it crucial to investigate the differentiation potential of MSCs from different sources to determine the optimal source of MSCs. We investigated if this biological heterogeneity in MSCs from different sources results in different mechanisms for their differentiation. In this study, we compared the gene expression patterns of phenotypically defined MSCs derived from three ontogenically different sources: Embryonic stem cells (hES-MSCs), Fetal limb (Flb-MSCs) and Bone Marrow (BM-MSCs). Differentially expressed genes between differentiated cells and undifferentiated controls were compared across the three MSC sources. We found minimal overlap in differential gene expression (5-16%) among the three sources. Flb-MSCs were similar to BM-MSCs based on differential gene expression patterns. Pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed a large variation in the canonical pathways leading to MSC differentiation. The similar canonical pathways among the three sources were lineage specific. The Flb-MSCs showed maximum overlap of canonical pathways with the BM-MSCs, indicating that the Flb-MSCs is an intermediate source between the less specialised hES-MSC source and the more specialised BM-MSC source. The source specific pathways prove that MSCs from the three ontogenically different sources use different biological pathways to obtain similar differentiation outcomes. Thus our study advocates the understanding of biological pathways to obtain optimal sources of MSCs for various clinical applications. The Microarray datasets comprises of hES-MSCs differentiated into the three lineages (Adipocytes (A), Chondrocytes (C) and Osteocytes (O)) at Day 7 and Day 21 as well as their undifferentiated form that was set as the control (Basal (B0) at Day 0).

During neocortical development, neurons undergo polarization, oriented migration, and layer type-specific differentiation. The transcriptional programs underlying these processes are not completely understood. Here we show that the transcription factor Bcl11a regulates polarity and migration of upper layer neurons. Bcl11a-deficient late-born neurons fail to correctly switch from multipolar to bipolar morphology resulting in impaired radial migration. We show that the expression of Sema3c is increased in migrating Bcl11a-deficient neurons and that Bcl11a is a direct negative regulator of Sema3c transcription. In vivo gain-of-function and rescue experiments demonstrate that Sema3c is a major downstream effector of Bcl11a required for the cell polarity switch and for the migration of upper layer neurons. Our data uncover a novel Bcl11a/Sema3c-dependent regulatory pathway used by migrating cortical neurons.

Abnormal activities of histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) and lysine deacetylases (HDACs) are associated with aberrant gene expression in breast cancer development. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between KDMs and HDACs in chromatin remodeling and regulation of gene transcription are still elusive. In this study, we showed that treatment of human breast cancer cells with inhibitors targeting the zinc cofactor dependent class I/II HDACs, but not NAD+ dependent class III HDACs, led to significant increase of H3K4me2 which is a specific substrate of histone lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and a key chromatin mark promoting transcriptional activation. We also demonstrated that inhibition of LSD1 activity by a pharmacological inhibitor, pargyline, or siRNA resulted in increased acetylation of H3K9 (AcH3K9). However, siRNA knockdown of LSD2, a homolog of LSD1, failed to alter the level of AcH3K9, suggesting that LSD2 activity may not be functionally connected with HDAC activity. Combined treatment with LSD1 and HDAC inhibitors resulted in enhanced levels of H3K4me2 and AcH3K9, and exhibited synergistic growth inhibition of breast cancer cells. Finally, microarray screening identified a unique subset of genes whose expression was significantly changed by combination treatment with inhibitors of LSD1 and HDAC. Our study suggests that LSD1 intimately interacts with histone deacetylases in human breast cancer cells. Inhibition of histone demethylation and deacetylation exhibits cooperation and synergy in regulating gene expression and growth inhibition, and may represent a promising and novel approach for epigenetic therapy of breast cancer.

Reduced incidence of experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) associated with decreased Th17 cell generation in vivo was observed in mice with SRC-3 deletion specifically in T cells.

To identify the pathways in which Alox5 gene regulates function of LSCs, we performed a comparative DNA microarray analysis using total RNA isolated from non-BCR-ABL-expressing Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+, BCR-ABL-expressing wild type LSCs and BCR-ABL-expressing Alox5-/- LSCs. The result was validated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis of non-BCR-ABL-expressing Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+, BCR-ABL-expressing wild type LSCs and BCR-ABL-expressing Alox5-/- LSCs.We have shown that Alox5 is a critical regulator of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in a BCR-ABL-induced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) mouse model, and we hypothesize that the Alox5 pathway represents a major molecular network that regulates LSC function. Therefore, we sought to further dissect this pathway by comparing the gene expression profiles of wild type and Alox5-/- LSCs derived from our mouse model for BCR-ABL-induced CML. DNA microarray analysis revealed a small group of candidate genes that exhibited changes in the levels of transcription in the absence of Alox5 expression. In particular, we noted that the expression of the Msr1 gene was up-regulated in Alox5-/- LSCs, suggesting that Msr1 might suppress the proliferation of LSCs. Using our CML mouse model, we show that Msr1 is down-regulated by BCR-ABL and this down-regulation is partially restored by Alox5 deletion, and that Msr1 deletion causes acceleration of CML development. Moreover, Msr1 deletion markedly increases LSC function through its effects on cell cycle progression and apoptosis. We also show that Msr1 affects CML development by regulating the PI3K-AKT pathway and b-Catenin. Together, these results demonstrate that Msr1 suppresses LSCs and CML development. The enhancement of Msr1 function may be of significance in the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting CML. To identify genes that are regulated by BCR-ABL in LSCs and LSCs without Alox5 gene, we compared the gene profile between wild type(WT) LSCs or Alox5-/- LSCs.",

Oxidative stress and mitochondrial function have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD but the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the degeneration of specific neuronal groups remains unclear. DJ-1 mutations are one cause of recessive parkinsonism, but this gene is also involved in cancer by promoting Ras signaling and suppressing PTEN-induced apoptosis. The specific function of DJ-1 is unclear, although it is responsive to oxidative stress and may play a role in the maintenance of mitochondria. Here we show that DJ-1 associates with specific RNA targets in cells and in the brain including mitochondrial genes, genes involved in glutathione metabolism and members of the PTEN/PI3K cascade. Pathogenic recessive mutants are deficient in this activity. We show that DJ-1 is sufficient for RNA binding at nanomolar concentrations in vitro and that there is some RNA sequence specificity to the association. Oxidative stress causes DJ-1 to dissociate from RNA. Using in vitro and in vivo models of mild oxidative stress, we show that DJ-1 normally suppresses translation in normal circumstances but allows translation after oxidative stress. We tested the hypothesis that these specific RNA targets are responsible for sensitivity to stress by exposing knockout flies to glutathione synthesis inhibitors and saw the predicted increased sensitivity in vivo. These data implicate a single mechanism for the pleiotropic effects of DJ-1 in different model systems, namely that the protein binds and regulates specific groups of RNA targets in an oxidationdependent manner. Furthermore, these results suggest how a small protein might both be an upstream regulator of processes important in parkinsonism and be a modifier of cancer-related processes.Keywords: Immunoprecipitated RNA comparisons. 6-8 biological replicates of RNA immunoprecipitated with DJ-1 protein was compared to RNA isolated with a nonspecific IgG control antibody in human cells, or to nonspecific RNA isolated with the DJ-1 antibody from KO mouse brains.",

Cancer metastasis requires that primary tumour cells evolve the capacity to intravasate into the lymphatic system or vasculature, and extravasate into and colonize secondary sites1. Others have demonstrated that individual cells within complex populations show heterogeneity in their capacity to form secondary lesions2 5. Here we develop a polyclonal mouse model of breast tumour heterogeneity, and show that distinct clones within a mixed population display specialization, for example, dominating the primary tumour, contributing to metastatic populations, or showing tropism for entering the lymphatic or vasculature systems. We correlate these stable properties to distinct gene expression profiles. Those clones that efficiently enter the vasculature express two secreted proteins, Serpine2 and Slpi, which were necessary and sufficient to program these cells for vascular mimicry. Our data indicate that these proteins not only drive the formation of extravascular networks but also ensure their perfusion by acting as anticoagulants. We propose that vascular mimicry drives the ability of some breast tumour cells to contribute to distant metastases while simultaneously satisfying a critical need of the primary tumour to be fed by the vasculature. Enforced expression of SERPINE2 and SLPI in human breast cancer cell lines also programmed them for vascular mimicry, and SERPINE2 and SLPI were overexpressed preferentially in human patients that had lung-metastatic relapse. Thus, these two secreted proteins, and the phenotype they promote, may be broadly relevant as drivers of metastatic progression in human cancer.

First, we identified estrogen-regulated genes using the ER+ MCF-7 breast cancer cell line treated with estrogen.

Small RNAs regulate the genetic networks through a ribonucleoprotein complex called the RNA induced silencing complexes (RISC), which in mammals contains at its center one of four Argonaute proteins (Ago1-4). A key regulatory event in the RNAi and miRNA pathways is Ago loading, where double stranded small RNA duplexes are incorporated into RISC (pre-RISC) and then become single stranded (mature-RISC), a process that is not well understood. The Agos contain an evolutionary conserved PAZ (Piwi/Argonaute/Zwille) domain whose primary function is to bind the 3'-end of small RNAs. We created multiple Paz domain disrupted Ago mutant proteins and studied their biochemical properties and biological functionality in cells. We found that the Paz domain is dispensable for Ago loading of slicing-competent RISC. In contrast, in the absence of slicer activity or slicer substrate duplex RNAs, Paz-disrupted Agos bound duplex siRNAs but were unable to unwind/eject the passenger strand and form functional RISC complexes. We have discovered that the highly conserved Paz domain plays an important role in RISC activation, providing new mechanistic insights into how miRNAs regulate genes, as well as new insights for future design of miRNA and RNAi-based therapeutics.

    "text": "Combined epigenetic and differentiation-based treatment inhibits neuroblastoma tumor growth and links HIF2a to tumor suppression [RNA-Seq]. Neuroblastoma is a pediatric cancer characterized by variable outcomes ranging from spontaneous regression to life-threatening progression. High-risk neuroblastoma patients receive myeloablative chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem-cell transplant followed by adjuvant retinoid differentiation treatment. However, the overall survival remains low; hence, there is an urgent need for alternative therapeutic approaches. One feature of high-risk neuroblastoma is the high level of DNA methylation of putative tumor suppressors. Combining the reversibility of DNA methylation with the differentiation-promoting activity of retinoic acid (RA) could provide an alternative strategy to treat high-risk neuroblastoma. Here we show that treatment with the DNA demethylating drug 5-Aza-deoxycytidine (AZA) restores high-risk neuroblastoma sensitivity to RA. Combined systemic distribution of AZA and RA impedes tumor growth and prolongs survival. Genomewide analysis of treated tumors reveals that this combined treatment rapidly induces a HIF2a-associated hypoxia-like transcriptional response followed by an increase in neuronal gene expression and a decrease in cell-cycle gene expression. A small-molecule inhibitor of HIF2a activity diminishes the tumor response to AZA+RA treatment, indicating that the increase in HIF2a levels is a key component in tumor response to AZA+RA. The link between increased HIF2a levels and inhibited tumor growth is reflected in large neuroblastoma patient datasets. Therein, high levels of HIF2a, but not HIF1a, significantly correlate with expression of neuronal differentiation genes and better prognosis but negatively correlate with key features of high-risk tumors, such as MYCN amplification. Thus, contrary to previous studies, our findings indicate an unanticipated tumor-suppressive role for HIF2a in neuroblastoma. 68 samples, 3-5 samples per group, 4st treatment molecules; Ctrl (DMSO), Retinoic acid (RA), 5-Aza-deoxycytidine (AZA) and RA+AZA. 2E6 cells were injected, treatment start day 8 and tumors were collected at end point (EP; 1000 m3), day 10 or day 14.",

We studied ~70-year-old participants (n=14), in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in which they were treated with 6 weeks each of metformin and placebo.

As expected, metformin therapy lowered 2-hour glucose, insulin AUC, and insulin secretion compared to placebo. Using FDR<0.05, 647 genes were differentially expressed in muscle and 146 genes were differentially expressed in adipose tissue. Both metabolic and non-metabolic pathways were significantly influenced, including pyruvate metabolism and DNA repair in muscle and PPAR & SREBP signaling, mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and collagen trimerization in adipose.

Cellular metabolic reprogramming occurred at early stage, boosting the number and function of stem/stem-like cells; while cell-intrinsic rewiring of signal transduction networks happened at later stage, promoting growth factor-independent proliferation. Strikingly, colonic DNA methylome was pre-programmed by obesity at young age priming for a tumor-prone gene signature after aging.

Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes are widely associated with positive outcomes, but are still markers of a systemic failed immune response against unresolved cancer. Cancer immunotherapies can reverse their tolerance phenotypes, while preserving tumor-reactivity and neoantigen-specificity shared with circulating immune cells. We performed comprehensive transcriptomic analyses to identify gene signatures common to circulating and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in the context of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Modulated genes also associated with disease outcome were validated in other cancer types. Using bioinformatics we identified practical diagnostic markers and actionable targets of the failed immune response. On circulating lymphocytes, three genes could efficiently stratify patients from healthy control donors. From their associations with resistance to cancer immunotherapies as well as viral and bacterial infections, we have uncovered not only pan-cancer, but pan-pathology failed immune response gene signatures.

The formation of granulomas is associated with the resolution of Q fever, a zoonosis due to Coxiella burnetii; however the molecular mechanisms of granuloma formation remain poorly understood. We generated human granulomas with peripheral blood mononuclear cells and beads coated with C. burnetii, using BCG extracts as controls. A microarray analysis showed dramatic changes in gene expression in granuloma cells compared with peripheral blood mononuclear cells. About 60% of modulated genes were common to C. burnetii and BCG granulomas including M1-related genes. C. burnetii granulomas also expressed a specific transcriptional profile that was essentially enriched in genes associated with type I interferon response (IFI44, IFI44L, IFI6, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, ISG15, IFIT1, IFITM2, IFITM3, MX1 and MX2). Real-time RT-PCR confirmed that C. burnetii especially increased the expression of interferon-stimulated genes in granulomas generated from controls or Q fever patients. Our results showed that granuloma formation is associated with a core of transcriptional response, but that the granulomatous response to C. burnetii is characterized by the activation of type I interferon-related genes, conferring a new role for type I interferon response in the control of C. burnetii infection.

Moreover the validity of externally defined gene-modules in FFPE microarray expression profiles is unknown. Using eight breast cancer tumors with available frozen and FFPE samples, five sample-matched data sets were generated from different combination of Affymetrix arrays, amplification-and-labeling kit and sample preservation method. The reliability of differential expression analysis was investigated by developing de novo ER/HER2 pathway gene-modules from matched data sets and validating it on external data set using ROC analysis. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of module scores between matched FFPE-frozen expression profiles was used to measure reliability of externally defined gene-modules in FFPE expression profiles. Independent of array/amplification-kit/sample preservation method used, de novo ER/HER2 gene-modules derived from all matching data sets showed similar prediction performance during independent validation (AUC range; ER: 0.92-0.95, HER2: 0.88-0.91), except for de novo HER2 gene-module derived from FFPE data set with 3'IVT kit (AUC: 0.67-0.72).

The goal of the present study is to analyze the characteristics of maternal to zygotic transition (MZT) in Arabidopsis.The maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) is an essential developmental turning point during the alternation of generations in both plants and animals. In animals, early embryogenesis is maternally controlled and zygotic genome activation (ZGA) starts much later. However, in plants, the timing of MZT and parental contributions to the zygotic transcriptome remain unclear. To address above mentioned questions, we selected Arabidopsis as model plant for the analysis. Regarding to the characteristics of MZT, egg cells, embryos including spherical zygote, elongated zygote, 1-cell embryo and 32-cell embryo were isolated and collected for RNA sequencing. Hybrid zygotes at two representative stages from the reciprocal crosses between polymorphic Arabidopsis Columbia (Col) and Landsberg erecta (Ler) accessions were also sequenced for investigating the parental contributions. We demonstrate that plant MZT occurs during the zygote stage and is a two-step process, first involving rapid maternal transcript degradation and, second, large-scale de novo transcription. Parental contributions to the zygotic transcriptome are stage dependent over the course of zygote development; the spherical zygote is characterized by a maternally dominated transcriptome, whereas the elongated zygote genome shows equal parental contributions.

Genetic variants at the PTPN2 locus, which encodes the tyrosine phosphatase PTPN2, cause reduced gene expression and are linked to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other autoimmune diseases. PTPN2 inhibits signaling through the T cell and cytokine receptors and loss of PTPN2 promotes T cell expansion and CD4 and CD8-driven autoimmunity. However, it remains unknown whether loss of PTPN2 in FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) plays a role in autoimmunity. Here we show that a reduction in Ptpn2 expression, comparable to that reported in human carriers of autoimmune-predisposing PTPN2 variants, unexpectedly enhances the severity of autoimmune arthritis through a Treg-intrinsic mechanism. Mechanistically, we found that through dephosphorylation of STAT3, Ptpn2 inhibits IL-6-driven pathogenic loss of FoxP3 after Tregs have acquired RORgt expression, at a stage when chromatin accessibility for STAT3-targeted IL-17 associated transcription factors is maximized. We conclude that PTPN2 promotes FoxP3 stability in RORgt+ Treg and that loss of function of PTPN2 in Treg contributes to the association between PTPN2 and autoimmunity.

Here, we report that a systemically administered 16-nt, unconjugated LNA (locked nucleic acid)-antimiR oligonucleotide complementary to the 5' end of miR-122 leads to specific, dose-dependent silencing of miR-122 and shows no hepatotoxicity in mice. Antagonism of miR-122 is due to formation of stable heteroduplexes between the LNA-antimiR and miR-122 as detected by northern analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated uptake of the LNA-antimiR in mouse liver cells, which was accompanied by markedly reduced hybridization signals for mature miR-122 in treated mice. Functional antagonism of miR-122 was inferred from a low cholesterol phenotype and de-repression within 24 h of 199 liver mRNAs showing significant enrichment for miR-122 seed matches in their 3' UTRs.

RNA-sequencing and ChIP-PCR analyses revealed that JMJD3 exerts anti-AML effect by directly modulating H3K4 and H3K27 methylation levels to activate the expression of a number of key myelopoietic regulatory genes. Mechanistic exploration identified a physical and functional association of JMJD3 with C/EBPb that presides the regulatory network of JMJD3. Thus, the leukemia regulatory role of JMJD3 varies in a disease phase- and lineage-dependent manner, and acts as a potential oncorepressor in certain subsets of AML largely by coupling to C/EBPb-centered myelopoietic program.This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

    "text": "Analysis of redundancy between RNAi and piRNA pathways in the mouse oocytes. Suppression of retrotransposons is an integral part of germline genome defense. The PIWI-associated RNA (piRNA) pathway mediates post-transcriptional and transcriptional silencing of retrotransposons in vertebrates. The loss of the piRNA pathway in mice results in male sterility while females remain fertile. Unlike spermatogenic cells, mouse oocytes utilize also RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, another small RNA pathway capable of retrotransposon suppression. To examine redundancy of piRNA and RNAi pathway in the mouse female germline, we produced an RNAi pathway mutant DicerSOM and crossed it with a catalytically-dead mutant of Mili, an essential piRNA factor. Ovaries and follicular development in mice lacking both pathways appear normal suggesting that RNAi in oocytes does not rescue a piRNA pathway knock-out phenotype. We observed that one of the pathways dominates in suppression of different retrotransposons. Intracisternal A Particle retrotransposon is mainly targeted by the piRNA pathway, MT and RLTR10 retrotransposons were targeted mainly by RNAi. Importantly, both pathways redundantly suppress LINE-1 retrotransposons where the loss of both RNA silencing pathways yielded ~6-fold upregulation of negligible levels of LINE-1 transcripts. This implies that another transcriptional silencing mechanism must contribute to LINE-1 repression and could explain why both, RNAi and piRNA pathways, are non-essential defense pathway in the mouse female germline. We report transcriptome profiles of partial and complete knockout of Dicer1 specific isoform in oocytes.",

To define its intracellular signaling mechanisms by which BMP4 regulates lung development, BMP-specific Smad1 or Smad5 was selectively knocked out in fetal mouse lung epithelial cells. Abrogation of lung epithelial-specific Smad1, but not Smad5, resulted in retardation of lung branching morphogenesis and reduced sacculation, accompanied by altered distal lung epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation, and consequently severe neonatal respiratory failure. By combining cDNA microarray with ChIP-chip analyses, Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (Wif1) was identified as a novel target gene of Smad1 in the developing mouse lung epithelial cells. Loss of Smad1 transcriptional activation of Wif1 expression was associated with reduced Wif1 expression and increased Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activity in lung epithelia, resulting in specific fetal lung abnormalities. Therefore, a novel regulatory loop of BMP4-Smad1-Wif1-Wnt/beta-catenin in coordinating BMP and Wnt pathways to control fetal lung development is suggested. mRNA profiling: Total RNA was isolated from left lobe lungs of three pair of E18.5 wild type and Smad1 lung epithelium-specific conditional knockout mice.",

We utilized a bioartificial matrix containing fibrillar collagen I, the major matrix component of bone, as scaffold for ex vivo expansion of HSCs. CD34+ HSCs were isolated from umbilical cord blood and cultivated within reconstituted collagen I fibrils in presence of FLT3-ligand, SCF and IL-3.

Although the total expansion factor of CD34+ cells was slightly lower when cells were cultivated in the collagen I gel, the frequency of colony-forming units (CFU-C) increased compared to control suspension cultures. Gene expression analysis with microarray chip technology revealed the upregulation of more than 50 genes in presence of collagen I. Among them, genes for several growth factors, cytokines and chemokines (e.g. interleukin 8, MIP1-a) could be confirmed by quantitative PCR.

MicroRNAs are small non-coding molecules that have been shown to repress the translation of thousands of genes. Changes in microRNA expression in a variety of diseases, including cancer, are leading to the development of microRNAs as early indicators of disease, and to their potential use as therapeutic agents. A significant hurdle to the use of microRNAs as therapeutics is our inability to predict the molecular and cellular consequences of perturbations in the levels of specific microRNAs on targeted cells. While the direct gene (mRNA) targets of individual microRNAs can be computationally predicted and are often experimentally validated, assessing the indirect effects of microRNA variation remains a major challenge in molecular systems biology. We present experimental evidence for a computational model that quantifies the extent to which down-regulated transcriptional repressors contribute to the unanticipated upregulation of putative microRNA targets. An appreciation of the effects of these repressors may provide a more complete understanding of the indirect effects of microRNA dysregulation in diseases such as cancer, and to their successful clinical application. mRNA were collected from the surface epithelial cells of 10 normal ovaries and from laser capture microdisection of 10 ovarian tumors. mRNA expression was captured on Affymetrix U133 Plus 2 chips.

FoxO transcription factors represent targets of the PI3K/PKB survival pathway controlling important biological processes such as stress responses, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, vascular remodelling and metabolism. Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of alternative mechanisms of FoxO-dependent gene expression beyond classical binding to a FoxO-responsive DNA binding element (FRE). Here we explored the relative contribution of those mechanisms by comparing the transcriptional responses to conditional activation of FoxO3 and a corresponding FRE-binding mutant in primary human endothelial cells. Microarray analysis revealed several functional gene clusters regulated in absence of an intact DNA-binding domain. Notably, both mutants triggered apoptosis albeit with different efficiencies. This was associated with regulation of overlapping and distinct proapototic gene clusters. Subsequent analysis demonstrated important roles for the Bcl2-like family members BIM and NOXA in this process. Remarkably, BIM was effectively induced by the FoxO3 FRE-binding mutant and BIM depletion could rescue its proapoptotic effect. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of alternatively regulated FoxO3 targets in primary cells and underscores the importance of such genes for endothelial function and integrity.

Here we determine the consequences of genetic alternation of NT3 signaling on genome-wide transcription programs in proprioceptors, an important sensory neuron subpopulation involved in motor reflex behavior. We find that the expression of many proprioceptor-enriched genes is dramatically altered by genetic NT3 elimination, independent of survival-related activities. Combinatorial analysis of gene expression profiles with proprioceptors isolated from mice expressing surplus muscular NT3 identifies an anticorrelated gene set with transcriptional levels scaled in opposite directions. Voluntary running experiments in adult mice further demonstrate the maintenance of transcriptional adjustability of genes expressed by DRG neurons, pointing to life-long gene expression plasticity in sensory neurons. We combined a mouse line expressing GFP under the control of the TrkC promoter (BAC transgene approach) with various NT3 signaling mutants in order to identify the transcriptional changes in identified subpopulations of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons.

The common response genes included a set of 23 genes significantly induced upon DV infection of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes, and B cells (analysis of variance, P < 0.05). Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), one of the common response genes, was identified as a key link between type I and type II interferon response genes. We found that DV induces TRAIL expression in immune cells and HUVECs at the mRNA and protein levels. The induction of TRAIL expression by DV was found to be dependent on an intact type I interferon signaling pathway. A significant increase in DV RNA accumulation was observed in anti-TRAIL antibody-treated monocytes, B cells, and HUVECs, and, conversely, a decrease in DV RNA was seen in recombinant TRAIL-treated monocytes. Furthermore, recombinant TRAIL inhibited DV titers in DV-infected DCs by an apoptosis-independent mechanism.

Understanding the relationship between radiation-induced breast cancer and obesity, together with information on underlying mechanisms, are potentially useful in risk management and prevention of second cancer in patients receiving radiotherapy. The present study aims to develop a novel animal model to study the relationship by combining two Sprague-Dawley rat models of radiation carcinogenesis and diet-induced obesity. Mammary carcinomas were induced in female obese and lean rats by irradiation with 4 Gy of gamma rays. Gene expression of mammary carcinomas and normal mammary tissues were analyzed with Agilent Whole Rat Genome DNA microarray. The result indicated that genes related to translation and oxidative phosphorylation were upregulated in carcinomas of obese rats. Female Sprague-Dawley (Jcl:SD) rats fed on a high fat diet (45 kcal% fat) were divided into obesity prone (OP, n = 30) and resistant (OR, n = 30) individuals based on the body weight at 7 weeks of age, when they were whole-body irradiated with 4 Gy of Cs-137 gamma rays at 0.5 Gy/min; lean control (LC, n = 30) rats were fed on a standard diet (10 kcal% fat) and irradiated in the same manner; these groups of rats were observed for development of palpable mammary cancer, while kept on the same diet, for 30 weeks. Mammary adenocarcinomas with homogeneous histology without necrosis or marked infiltrating cells were selected for microarray analysis (OP, n = 6; OR, n = 3; LC, n = 3) as well as normal tissues (OP, n = 3; OR, n = 2; LC, n = 3).

For most human cancers, the identity of the cells that initiate and promote metastasis is still unknown, hampering our ability to develop therapies to prevent or inhibit the spread of tumour cells to distant sites. Using an orthotopic model of human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), we have now identified a subpopulation of CD44bright cells within the primary lesion with the highest potential to develop lymph node and lung metastasis. This population is slow-cycling, expresses high levels of the receptor CD36 at the cell membrane and relies on fatty acid metabolism to thrive in lymph nodes and bronchoalveolar environments. Importantly, inhibition of CD36 by either shRNA or neutralizing monoclonal antibodies severely impairs metastatic spread of primary OSCC patient samples and established cell lines. Further underscoring its importance, CD36 overexpression in poorly disseminating tumours confers an aggressive metastatic behaviour. Analyses of public gene expression data indicate that the presence of the signature-defining CD36+ cells also strongly correlates with a poor prognosis in patients with lung SCC, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, or luminal breast cancer. By identifying metastasis-promoting cells and then targeting them with CD36 inhibition, novel anti-metastatic therapies could be developed for patients with these types of tumours. 3 biological replicates from Detroit-562 (Detroit #1,#2, #3) cell line and 2 biological replicates from patient derived cell line VDH-02 (hpSCC/VDH02 #2, #4) were included.

Understanding the crosstalk between malignant B-cells and their milieu could provide clues on the molecular and clinical biology of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). Aiming to generate novel therapeutic strategies, different groups have studied different CLL proliferative fractions. We previously, identified one of these proliferative subsets in the peripheral blood from progressive unmutated CLL patients. Since the presence of this small subset appears to be a hallmark of a proliferative disease in which B lymphocytes are being constitutively activated in the proliferative centers of these patients, we performed gene expression analysis comparing the global mRNA and microRNAs expression of this leukemic subpopulation. Our results suggest that the proliferative behaviour of this fraction appears to depend on microRNA-22 over-expression, which induces PTEN downregulation and PI3K/AKT pathway activation. Transfection experiments demonstrated that miR-22 overexpression in CLL B-cells switches on PI3K/AKT leading to FOXO1 inactivation, p27-Kip1 downregulation, and overexpression of Survivin and Ki-67 proteins. We also demonstrated that this pathway could be triggered by microenvironment signals like CD40L/IL4 and more importantly, that this regulatory loop is also present in lymph nodes from progressive UM patients. Altogether, these results underline the key role of PI3K/AKT pathway in the generation of the CLL proliferative pool and provide rationale for the usage of PI3K inhibitors.

Defective Hippo/YAP signaling in the liver results in tissue overgrowth and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we uncover mechanisms of YAP-mediated hepatocyte reprogramming and HCC pathogenesis. We show that YAP functions as a rheostat maintaining metabolic specialization, differentiation and quiescence within the hepatocyte compartment. Importantly, treatment with siRNA-lipid nanoparticles (siRNA-LNPs) targeting YAP restores hepatocyte differentiation and causes pronounced tumor regression in a genetically engineered mouse HCC model (mice with liver-specific Mst1/Mst2 double knockout). Furthermore, YAP targets are enriched in an aggressive human HCC subtype characterized by a proliferative signature and absence of CTNNB1 mutations. Thus, our work reveals Hippo signaling as a key regulator of positional identity of hepatocytes, supports targeting YAP using siRNA-LNPs as a paradigm of differentiation-based therapy, and identifies an HCC subtype potentially responsive to this approach. Mice with liver-specific Mst1/Mst2 double-knockout (Adeno-Cre injected Mst1-/-; Mst2Flox/Flox mice) were monitored for the formation of HCC by ultrasound imaging.

Cluster and promoter analyses suggested driver genes that specifically responded to the EE, and pointed to a pivotal role of Egr1 to have hierarchically activated other drivers. We suggest a model in which EE-induced driver genes prevent and counter-balance perturbations of SNCA overexpression, restoring a largely normalized gene expression profile and system state. Using a 2x2 factorial design, we cross-compared a line of transgenic mice overexpressing human SNCA with wildtype animals, and the effects of a long-term EE with standard housing conditions.

Many of the newly discovered protein-coding genes encode peptides and small proteins, referred to collectively as microproteins. Microproteins are produced through ribosome translation of small open reading frames (smORFs). The discovery of many smORFs reveals a blind spot in traditional gene-finding algorithms for these genes. Biological studies have found roles for microproteins in cell biology and physiology, and the potential that there exists additional bioactive microproteins drives the interest in detection and discovery of these molecules. A key step in any proteogenomics workflow is the assembly of RNA-Seq data into likely mRNA transcrips that are then used to create a searchable protein databases. Here we demonstrate that specific features of the assembled transcriptome impact microprotein detection by shotgun proteomics. By tailoring transcript assembly for downstream mass spectrometry searching, we show that we can detect more than double the number of high-quality microprotein candidates and introduce a novel open-source mRNA assembler for proteogenomics (MAPS) that incorporates all of these features. By integrating our specialized assembler, MAPS, and a popular generalized assembler into our proteogenomics pipeline, we detect 45 novel human microproteins from a high quality proteogenomics dataset of a human cell line. We then characterize the features of the novel microproteins, identifying two classes of microproteins.

Specific deletion of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (Socs3) in keratinocytes can cause severe skin inflammation with infiltration of immune cells, however the molecular mechanisms and key regulatory pathways involved remains poorly understood. To investigate the role of Socs3 in keratinocytes, we generated and analyzed global RNA-Seq profiles in Socs3 conditional knockout (cKO) mice at two different stages (2- and 10- weeks). Over 400 shared genes were found to be significantly regulated at both time points. Two week samples were marked by initial skin barrier dysfunction established by the downregulation of keratin associated genes and upregulation of genes regulating lipid metabolism. Subsequent increase in expression level of multiple chemokines and cytokines at 10 week were observed representing response to skin inflammation caused by the disruption of skin barrier function. A group of activator protein-1 related genes were to found to be highly elevated in Socs3 cKO mice at both time points. This observation was duly validated using qRT-PCR in Socs3 depleted human keratinocyte-derived HaCaT cells. Overall this study reveals an important regulatory dynamics of Socs3 in skin barrier dysfunction.

Numerous cytokines have been shown to affect epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation through epithelial-mesenchymal interaction. Growing evidence suggests that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling is an important mediator of these interactions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of PDGF-a on enterocyte turnover in a rat model of short bowel syndrome (SBS). Male rats were divided into four groups: Sham rats underwent bowel transection, Sham-PDGF-a rats underwent bowel transection and were treated with PDGF-a, SBS rats underwent a 75% bowel resection, and SBS-PDGF-a rats underwent bowel resection and were treated with PDGF-a. Parameters of intestinal adaptation, enterocyte proliferation and apoptosis were determined at sacrifice. Illumina's Digital Gene Expression (DGE) analysis was used to determine PDGF-related gene expression profiling. PDGF-a and PDGF-a receptor (PDGFR-a) expression was determined using Real Time PCR. Western blotting was used to determine p-ERK, Akt1/2/3, bax and bcl-2 protein levels. SBS rats demonstrated a significant increase in PDGF-a and PDGFR-a expression in jejunum and ileum compared to sham animals. SBS-PDGF-a rats demonstrated a significant increase in bowel and mucosal weight, villus height and crypt depth in jejunum and ileum compared to SBS animals. PDGF-a expression in crypts increased in SBS rats (vs sham) and was accompanied by increased cell proliferation following PDGF-a administration. A significant decrease in cell apoptosis in this group was correlated with lower bax protein levels. In conclusion, in a rat model of SBS, PDGF-a stimulates enterocyte turnover, which is correlated with up-regulated PDGF-a receptor expression in the remaining small intestine. Animals were divided randomly into two experimental groups of 6 rats each. Group A rats underwent bowel transection and re-anastomosis (Sham), Group B animals underwent 75% bowel resection (SBS). Due to the quality of DNA, we performed final analysis from 5 jejunal samples (1 sham and 4 resected rats) and from 7 ileal samples (3 sham and 4 resected rats).

CD4(+) type 1 T regulatory (Tr1) cells are induced in the periphery and have a pivotal role in promoting and maintaining tolerance.

By gene expression profiling of human Tr1 cell clones, we identified the surface markers CD49b and lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) as being stably and selectively coexpressed on mouse and human Tr1 cells. We showed the specificity of these markers in mouse models of intestinal inflammation and helminth infection and in the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that transcriptionally active leukemia-associated fusion oncogenes alter self-renewal in and generate acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from committed progenitors, linking transformation and self-renewal pathways. AML is a heterogeneous disease, both genetically and biologically, and it is not known whether transformation is mediated by common or overlapping genetic programs downstream of multiple mutations or through the engagement of unique programs downstream of individual mutations. This distinction is important, as the demonstration of common pathways may identify common molecular targets for the treatment of AML.Here we demonstrate that the ability to alter self-renewal in vitro and in vivo is a more generalized property of leukemia-associated oncogenes. We further demonstrate that disparate leukemia-associated oncogenes initiate early common and overlapping transformation and self-renewal gene expression programs to mediate these effects. Furthermore, elements of these programs can be detected in established leukemia stem cells from an animal model and across a large cohort of patients with differing acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subtypes, where they strongly predict for disease biology. Finally, individual genes from the programs are demonstrated to partially phenocopy the leukemia-associated oncogenes and themselves alter self-renewal in committed murine progenitors and generate AML when expressed in murine bone marrow. The dataset comprises granulocyte monocyte precursors (GMP) transduced with either GFP alone or the fusion oncogenes MOZ-TIF2 or NUP98-HOXA9 or AML1-ETO, as labelled. Early gene expression changes (36 hours after transduction) were analysed between these replicate samples in two separate ways; either in a single two-class comparison of all oncogene transduced GMP with empty-vector transduced GMP or in three separate two-class comparisons comparing each oncogene individually with empty-vector transduced GMP. In the first analysis we identified 1082 genes/1119 probesets whose expression levels significantly differed (FDR level 0.05). There is a loss of self-renewal potential in the transition from the LSK to GMP population and to further enrich for potential self-renewal genes we compared the expression of these genes/probes in sorted normal LSK versus GMP populations. Genes which were not significantly (p<0.05) and similarly differentially expressed between LSK and GMP were excluded, allowing us to prioritize an immediate \"leukemia initiation\" program of 167 genes (182 probesets). Our second analysis demonstrated differential expression of 5750, 1161, and 5109 genes, when MOZ-TIF2, NUP98-HOXA9 and AML1-ETO transduced GMP were respectively compared with empty-vector transduced GMP (p<0.05). When our \"leukemia initiation\" signature was compared to the single comparisons, 127/167 (76%) genes overlapped. To assess the evolutionary nature of transcriptional programs critical for leukemia induction and maintenance, the gene expression profiles of replicate functionally validated leukemic stem cells from a MOZ-TIF2 model of leukemia (L-GMP) were then compared to their normal phenotypic counterpart (normal GMP). 2715 genes were differentially expressed between normal and leukemic GMP (p<0.05). Similarities were seen between our immediate pre-leukemic signatures and the gene expression profiles in the overt leukemias. The overlap with the leukemia initiation and leukemia self-renewal signatures was highly significant at 59/167 genes (35%) and 29/91 genes (32%), respectively (both p<0.0001). Gene expression levels were measured using Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) GeneChip Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 arrays (22,690 probesets) with hybridisation and washes as per the manufacturers specifications. The starting point for all analyses was the ''.CEL'' files from the MAS5 software. Data was analyzed using the R statistical package bioconductor18. Data quality was assessed using functions in the affy and affyPLM packages and outlier arrays were removed from subsequent analysis. The GCRMA algorithm (ver. 2.4.1) was used to obtain normalized expression estimates. Genes were selected for further analysis on the following basis: genes that had probesets for which the expression value was greater than 60 (which in our study constitute the average background reading of all probesets) and that had a present flag call in at least two of three samples. To detect significant changes in the expression levels, two-sample Welch t-tests (parametric; assuming unequal variances; Benjamini and Hochberg step-up multiple testing correction at a False Discovery Rate <0.05) was applied to the resulting genes.",

    "text": "Role of Microglial C5aR1 in the Arctic Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model. C5aR1, a receptor for the complement activation proinflammatory fragment, C5a, is primarily expressed on cells of the myeloid lineage, and to a lesser extent on endothelial cells and neurons in brain. Previous work demonstrated C5aR1 antagonist, PMX205, decreased amyloid pathology and suppressed cognitive deficits in Alzheimer Disease (AD) mouse models. In the Arctic AD mouse model, genetic deletion of C5aR1 prevented behavior deficits at 10 months. However, the molecular mechanisms of this protection has not been definitively demonstrated. To understand the role of microglial C5aR1 in the Arctic AD mouse model, we have taken advantage of the CX3CR1GFP and CCR2RFP reporter mice to distinguish microglia as GFP-positive and infiltrating monocytes as GFP and RFP positive, for subsequent transcriptome analysis on specifically sorted myeloid populations from wild type and AD mouse models. Immunohistochemical analysis of mice aged to 2, 5, 7 and 10 months showed no change in amyloid beta (Ab) deposition in the Arctic C5aR1 knockout (KO) mice relative to that seen in the Arctic mice. Of importance, no CCR2+ monocytes/macrophages were found near the plaques in the Arctic brain with or without C5aR1. RNA-seq analysis on microglia from these mice identified inflammation related genes as differentially expressed, with increased expression in the Arctic mice relative to wildtype and decreased expression in the Arctic/C5aR1KO relative to Arctic. In addition, phagosomal-lysosomal proteins and protein degradation pathways that were increased in the Arctic mice were further increased in the Arctic/C5aR1KO mice. These data are consistent with a microglial polarization state with restricted induction of inflammatory genes and enhancement of clearance pathways. Microglia mRNA profiles of wildtype (WT), C5aR1 knockout (C5aR1KO), Arctic (ARC) and Arctic C5aR1 knockout (ARCKO) mice at 2, 5, 7 and 10-11 month.

Adult neural stem cells (NSCs) derive from embryonic precursors, but little is known about how or when this occurs. We have addressed this issue using single cell RNAseq at multiple developmental timepoints to analyze the embryonic murine cortex, one source of adult forebrain NSCs. We computationally identify all major cortical cell types, including the embryonic radial precursors (RPs) that generate adult NSCs. We define the initial emergence of RPs from neuroepithelial stem cells at E11.5. We show that by E13.5 these RPs express a transcriptional identity that is maintained and reinforced throughout their transition to a non-proliferative state between E15.5 and E17.5. These slowly-proliferating late embryonic RPs share a core transcriptional phenotype with quiescent adult forebrain NSCs. Together, these findings support a model where cortical RPs maintain a core transcriptional identity from embryogenesis through to adulthood, and where the transition to a quiescent adult NSC occurs during late neurogenesis. We applied the high-throughput single-cell mRNA sequencing technique, Drop-seq, to the embryonic mouse cortex. 2000-5000 single cells from wildtype CD1 embryos of gestational ages E11.5, E13.5, E15.5 and E17.5 were characterized.",

    "text": "Human CD28+/- tumor infiltrating lymphocytes gene expression. This analysis reveals the different gene expression profiles between human melanoma tumor infiltrating lymphocytes subsets CD8+CD28+ and CD8+CD28-.Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) is an effective approach that removes tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from this suppressive tumor microenvironment and expands and activates CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in vitro, differentiating them into potent anti-tumor effector cells that can be re-introduced back into patients. One of the key problems that may limit tumor regression and long-term durable clinical responses in ACT is the persistence of TILs following infusion. Our study has indicated that ex vivo expanded TILs to be hypo-responsive to peptide re-stimulation, manifested in slow entry into cell cycle and increased apoptosis. Phenotypic and functional analysis using a number of different T-cell differentiation markers found that CD28 was markedly down-modulated in post-REP cells, while CD27 and CD57 levels showed no statistically-relevant changes in expression. Here on a global gene expression level, microarray gene chip analysis of sorted CD8+CD28+ and CD8+CD28- post-REP TILs revealed a number of key differences in their gene expression profiles; notably, an increase in KIR family member expression, loss of p53-binding proteins, and lower CD127/IL-7Ra gene expression found in the CD28- population. On top of advancing T cell phenotype, reactivation and memory, this set of data may also provide insight for ACT clinical protocol optimization to improve TIL response in vivo. After isolation from tumor fragment and ex vivo expansion with IL-2, human tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were sorted by FACS into two subsets as described, followed by an immediate microarray analysis.Specifically: The tumor samples were cut into 3-5 mm2 pieces and cultured in 2 ml of TIL culture medium (TIL-CM) consisting of RPMI 1640, 10% human AB serum, 1 mM Glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1X Penicillin-Streptomcyin (Pen-Strep), and 20 mg/ml Gentmicin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in 24-well plates. IL-2, at 6,000 U/ml was added to all wells. The dividing TIL lines were fed with fresh TIL-CM containing 3,000 U/ml IL-2 (Proleukin(r) from Novartis) and sub-cultured 1:1 in TIL-CM with 6,000 U/ml IL-2 to maintain viable cell density between 0.5-2 x 10e6/ml. These TILs were designated as \"pre-REP\" and were subjected to continued expansion using the \"rapid expansion protocol\" (REP) originally designed by Riddell and Greenberg. Briefly, 1.3 x 10e5 pre-REP TILs in TIL-CM were added to upright T-25 flasks containing 30 ng/ml OKT3 and 26 x 10e6 allogeneic irradiated (5,000 cGy) PBMC feeder cells obtained from 4 pooled normal donor PBMC (obtained from the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Bank, Houston, TX) in 20 ml of TIL-CM. On day 2, 10 ml of AIMV (Invitrogen) was added together with 6,000 U/ml IL-2 (final concentration). The TILs were expanded for another 12 days and diluted as needed with AIMV and IL-2 to keep the viable cell density between 1-4 x 106/ml. Using this methodology, routinely 50-100 x 10e6 \"post-REP\" TIL were isolated from each starting T-25 flask culture. Post-REP TILs were freshly harvested from the flasks and sorted after anti-CD4 and anti-CD28 staining into CD4-, CD28+ and CD4-, CD28- two subsets. After a 3 h rest period to shed off staining antibodies post sorting, TILs were processed with Qiagen RNeasy kit to obtain RNA for microarray experiment. 1 mg of RNA of each sample was subjected to reverse transcription and probe blotting using an Illumina kit, where human Ref6 chip was used (Illumina, Inc.).",

The reassorted human 2009 pandemic H1N1 (H1N1pdm) virus infected millions of people and caused thousands of deaths with associated immunopathology. Traditional immunosuppressants have limited capabilities in controlling inflammatory responses associated with severe influenza infections. A new therapeutic strategy, therefore, must be developed. We evaluated several adjuvants including toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, TLR independent adjuvants and Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) for limiting severe H1N1pdm infection outcomes in a mouse model. In contrast to the TLR agonists and TLR independent adjuvants, CFA which contains multiple pattern recognition receptor (PRR) agonists significantly restrained pro-inflammatory responses and promoted survival in mice from lethal H1N1pdm infection. CFA reduced expression of the plamacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) markers and interferon alpha (IFN-a) after infection, whereas it elevated the T regulatory (Treg) cell suppressive molecules galectin-1 and CTLA-4 expression. Consequently, Th1 cell differentiation and CD8+ effector T cell responses were diminished via downregulated myeloid DC (mDC) costimulation. Furthermore, CTLA-4 expressing Treg cells were dramatically increased when the CFA primed splenocytes were restimulated with its stimuli-killed mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. TB). The elevated CTLA-4 on Treg cells led to reduced CD86 expressing pDCs/mDCs and less CD4+ effector T cells. Overall, our study highlights that the stimuli of innate immunity potentially controls overactive host immune responses in certain situations, and the uncovered mechanism(s) sheds light on the development of anti-influenza therapies. C57B6/J Mice were treated with CFA at day -2 and day 2 post H1N1pdm infection. Weight loss and lethality were monitored post infection. At day 3 and day 5 lung tissues were collected for RNA extraction and expression array analysis.",

Status epilepticus (SE) is a life-threatening condition that can give rise to a number of neurological disorders, including learning deficits, depression, and epilepsy. Many of the effects of SE appear to be mediated by alterations in gene expression. To gain deeper insight into how SE affects the transcriptome, we employed the pilocarpine SE model in mice and Illumina-based high-throughput sequencing to characterize alterations in gene expression from the induction of SE, to the development of spontaneous seizure activity. While some genes were upregulated over the entire course of the pathological progression, each of the three sequenced time points (12-hour, 10-days and 6-weeks post-SE) had a largely unique transcriptional profile. Hence, genes that regulate synaptic physiology and transcription were most prominently altered at 12-hours post-SE; at 10-days post-SE, marked changes in metabolic and homeostatic gene expression were detected; at 6-weeks, substantial changes in the expression of cell excitability and morphogenesis genes were detected. At the level of cell signaling, KEGG analysis revealed dynamic changes within the MAPK pathways, as well as in CREB-associated gene expression. Notably, the inducible expression of several noncoding transcripts was also detected. These findings offer potential new insights into the cellular events that shape SE-evoked pathology. . cDNA from two animals was pooled into two independent biological replicates for each timepoint (ie. two sets of two animals per experimental group: control, 12 hours, 10 days, 6 weeks).

Heart toxicity occurred at day 2 of exposure in all three regions of the heart (atrium, ventricle, interventricular septum) and was characterized by myofiber vacuolation, necrosis, mononuclear-cell infiltration, and atrial thrombosis. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that the primary site of damage occured in the mitochondrion. Damaged mitochondria had disrupted cristae and loss of membrane structure, and distention of the myocardial sarcoplasmic reticulum. By day 5, even though daily dosing was continued, the heart toxic lesions begin to resolved. By day 16, even though BCEM treatment continued, the heart appeared normal.RNA was extracted from control and dosed rats at day 2 and day 5, and analyzed for gene change by PCR. Gene changes associated with promoting cell growth including up regulation of growth factors and cell adhesion molecules were up regulated. Temperature regulation was promoted by up regulation of uncoupling proteins. Genes controlling the action potential of the heart, including ion flow and G protein signals, were altered. Because mitochondria are damaged by BCEM exposure, preserving and restoring energy function to the heart is considered to be essential, and up regulation of components of the ATP synthase unit occurred by day 5.Significant gene changes included up regulation of transcription factors, growth factors, membrane bound G protein signals, and ion transport controls.

The administrations were applied to the skin of the male rats at 0.5 ml/kg body to deliver doses of 0, 400, or 600 mg/kg body weight. All dose formulations were determined to be within +-10% of target concentrations. Approximately 45% of a dermal dose of CEM is adsorbed (NIEHS Contract NO1-ES-75407 2002). Male F344/N rats (Taconic Laboratories, Germantown, NY) were placed on study at 5 weeks of age and housed one per cage in polycarbonate cages in rooms maintained at temperatures between 69 and 75degF with 35 - 65% relative humidity and a 12-hr light/dark cycle. Control and treated groups received irradiated NTP-2000 diet (Zeigler Brothers, Gardners, PA) ad libitum.Histopathology:Animals were anesthetized with CO 2 and heart collected and preserved in 10% formalin. Slides were made from paraffin sections from rats treated with BCEM as previously described (Dunnick et al. 2004a). Pathologic analysis included comparing heart lesions in male rats after 2, 3, 5, and 16 days of treatment.RNA Extraction MethodsRNA was extracted from hearts of three control animal at day 2, three control rats at day 5, three rats exposed to 200, 400, or 600 mg/kg BCEM at day 2 and three at day 5. Animals designated for heart RNA extraction were anesthetized with CO2/O2 on study days 2 and 5, exanguinated, and their hearts infused with RNAlater. Total cardiac RNA was isolated from hearts using the QIAGEN Rneasy kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). The RNA was quantified through optical density measurements and agarose gel electrophoresis, and kept frozen at - 70 C. RNA was extracted from control, 200, 400, and 600 mg/kg rats.",

    "text": "Active Creb3L1 can upregulate secretory pathway genes in HeLa cells. Abstract: Secretion occurs in all cells, with relatively low levels in most cells and extremely high levels in specialized secretory cells, such as those of the pancreas, salivary and mammary glands. Here, we report that the CrebA/Creb3-like family of bZip transcription factors functions to upregulate expression of both the general protein machinery required in all cells for secretion and of cell-type specific secreted proteins. Drosophila CrebA directly binds the enhancers of secretory pathway genes and is both necessary and sufficient to activate expression of every secretory pathway component gene examined thus far. Microarray profiling reveals that CrebA also upregulates expression of genes encoding cell type specific secreted components. Finally, we find that the human CrebA orthologues, Creb3L1 and Creb3L2, have the ability to upregulate the secretory pathway in non-secretory cell types.Goals: Creb3L1 is the closest related human orthologue of Drosophila CrebA. CrebA is required to upregulate genes encoding the protein machinery and cargo in specialized secretory cells. To determine if the human orthologues of CrebA, Creb3L1 and Creb3L2, perform the same function, we expressed the truncated active form of Creb3L1 in non-secretory HeLa cells. We then performed microarray experiments and found that active Creb3L1 is sufficient to upregulate genes encoding the protein machinery of the secretory pathway, as observed with Drosophila CrebA. HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with truncated Creb3L1 (Creb3L1 T) and GFP. Following 20 hours in culture, GFP positive cells were isolated by FACS and RNA was extracted using the Rneasy kit (Qiagen). As a control, mock transfected cells were also subjected to cell sorting and RNA was extracted using the same protocols. At least three replicates were obtained for each group.",

    "text": "Microprocessor mediates transcription termination in long noncoding microRNA genes. MicroRNA (miRNA) play a major role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. In mammals most miRNA derive from the introns of protein coding genes where they exist as hairpin structures in the primary gene transcript, synthesized by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). These are cleaved co-transcriptionally by the Microprocessor complex, comprising DGCR8 and the RNase III endonuclease Drosha, to release the precursor (pre-)miRNA hairpin, so generating both miRNA and spliced messenger RNA1-4. However, a substantial minority of miRNA originate from Pol II-synthesized long non coding (lnc) RNA where transcript processing is largely uncharacterized5. Here, we show that most lnc-pri-miRNA do not use the canonical cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) transcription termination pathway6, but instead use Microprocessor cleavage both to release pre-miRNA and terminate transcription. We present a detailed characterization of one such lnc-pri-miRNA that generates the highly expressed liver-specific miR-1227. Genome-wide analysis then reveals that Microprocessor-mediated transcription termination is commonly used by lnc-pri-miRNA but not by protein coding miRNA genes. This identifies a fundamental difference between lncRNA and pre-mRNA processing. Remarkably, inactivation of the Microprocessor can lead to extensive transcriptional readthrough of lnc-pri-miRNA, resulting in inhibition of downstream genes by transcriptional interference. Consequently we define a novel RNase III-mediated, polyadenylation-independent mechanism of Pol II transcription termination in mammalian cells. Chromatin associated RNA-seq from sicntrl,siDrosha,siDGCR8 treated Hela cells. Same for sicntrl and siDGCR8 from Huh7 cells.

Previously, we have reported that genomic loss of 14q occurs more frequently in high grade clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) than low grade ones and shows a significant impact on the expression levels of genes located on this region, suggesting that the genes located on the region and downregulated by the loss may be involved in the malignant transformation of ccRCCs. Here, among the genes located on the minimal common region of 14q loss, we found that 6 were significantly downregulated in high grade ccRCCs due to copy number loss. Using the data set from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network, downregulation of one out of the 6 genes, WDR20, was significantly associated with poorer prognosis for the patients with ccRCC, suggesting that downregulation of WDR20 may be involved in the malignant transformation of ccRCC. In functional assays, exogeneous WDR20 significantly inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in RCC cell lines. Interestingly, the phosphorylation levels of ERK and AKT, which reportedly contribute to the malignant phenotype of RCC cells, were clearly reduced by the exogeneous expression of WDR20. Thus, our data suggest that downregulation of WDR20 due to 14q loss may be involved in the malignant transformation of ccRCCs in part through the activation of ERK and AKT pathways. Downregulated expression levels of genes in minimal common region due to 14q loss. Expression levels of 6 genes were determined by microarray analysis and compared between normal kidney tissues (normal, n=16), low grade (low, n=16) and high grade (high, n=16) ccRCCs. The expression level (log2) normalized by the median expression level for the 16 normal samples.",

    "text": "Rational selection of syngeneic preclinical tumor models for immunotherapeutic drug discovery [exon array]. Murine syngeneic tumor models are the cornerstone of novel immuno-oncology (IO)-based therapy development but the molecular and immunological features of these models are still not clearly defined. The translational relevance of differences between the models is not fully understood, impeding appropriate preclinical model selection for target validation, and ultimately hindering drug development. Within a panel of commonly-used murine syngeneic tumor models, we showed variable responsiveness to IO-therapies. We employed aCGH, whole-exome sequencing, exon microarray analysis and flow cytometry to extensively characterise these models and revealed striking differences that may underlie these contrasting response profiles. We identified strong differential gene expression in immune-related pathways and changes in immune cell-specific genes that suggested differences in tumor immune infiltrates between models. We further investigated this using flow cytometry, which showed differences in both the composition and magnitude of the tumor immune infiltrates, identifying models that harbor 'inflamed' and 'non-inflamed' tumor immune infiltrate phenotypes. Moreover, we found that immunosuppressive cell types predominated in syngeneic mouse tumor models that did not respond to immune-checkpoint blockade, whereas cytotoxic effector immune cells were enriched in responsive models. A cytotoxic cell-rich tumor immune infiltrate has been correlated with increased efficacy of IO-therapy in the clinic and these differences could underlie the varying response profiles to IO-therapy between the syngeneic models. This characterisation highlighted the importance of extensive profiling and will enable investigators to select appropriate models to interrogate the activity of IO-therapies as well as combinations with targeted therapies in vivo. Mouse syngeneic tumour cell lines were grown in vitro n=1 and in vivo n 5 subcutaneously on the backs of mice from their parental strain or orthotopically (see sample records for specific details for each mouse model). Mice were sacrificed when tumours reached an average of 200 mm3. In vitro samples underwent aCGH analysis and transcriptomics analysis while in vivo tumor samples along with a draining lymph node and spleen sample were taken from the same mouse and underwent transcriptomics analysis. Whole exome sequencing and immunophenotyping were also performed on these syngeneic models to in all give a multiomic characterisation of these models.",

Whereas previous studies suggested that AZIN2 might participate in mouse spermatogenesis, immunohistological analysis of human testicular sections revealed that AZIN2 is also detected in the steroidogenic Leydig cells but not in the germinal epithelium. In the present study, we found a close ontogenic similarity in the mRNA levels of OAZs and AZINs between mice and rats, but an opposite expression pattern of ODC activity. Further analysis of AZIN2 and OAZ3 in the testis of mice with different alterations in spermatogenesis and fertility, induced either genetically or pharmacologically, corroborated that both AZIN2 and OAZ3 are mainly expressed in the haploid germinal cells. Finally, by using transgenic mice with a truncated Azin2 gene fused to the bacterial lacZ gene, we studied the expression of Azin2 in testes, epididymides and spermatozoa. AZIN2 was detected in spermatids and spermatozoa, as well as in Leydig cells, and in epithelial epidydimal cells. Azin2 knock-out male mice were fertile; however, they showed marked decreases in testicular putrescine and plasma and testicular testosterone levels, and a dramatic reduction in the sperm motility. These results suggest an important role for AZIN2 in testicular cells by modulating polyamine concentrations, testosterone synthesis and sperm function. Overall, our data corroborate the relevance of polyamine regulation in spermatogenesis, where both AZIN2 and OAZ3 play fundamental roles.We used microarrays in order to detect how the disruption of Azin2 could affect overall gene expression in testis. Homogeneous populations of male adult mice were selected for testis RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. For this analysis, we used two samples from Azin2 KO mice (KO1 and KO2) and two samples from Azin2 WT mice (WT1 and WT2).",

The transcription factor c-JUN and its upstream kinase JNK1 have been implicated in BCR-ABL induced leukemogenesis. JNK1 has been shown to regulate BCL2 expression thereby altering leukemogenesis, but the impact of c-JUN remained unclear. In this study we show that JNK1 and c-JUN promote leukemogenesis via separate pathways, since lack of c-JUN impairs proliferation of p185BCR-ABL transformed cells without affecting viability. The decreased proliferation of c-JunD/D cells is associated with the loss of cyclin dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) expression. In c-JunD/D cells CDK6 expression becomes down-regulated upon BCR-ABL induced transformation which correlates with CpG island methylation within the 5' region of Cdk6. We verified the impact of Cdk6 deficiency by using Cdk6-/- mice that developed BCR-ABL induced B-lymphoid leukemia with significantly increased latency and an attenuated disease phenotype. In addition we show that re-expression of CDK6 in BCR-ABL transformed c-JunD/D cells reconstitutes proliferation and tumor formation in Nu/Nu mice. In summary, our study reveals a novel function for the AP-1 transcription factor c-JUN in leukemogenesis by antagonizing promoter methylation. Moreover, we identify CDK6 as relevant and critical target of AP-1 regulated DNA methylation upon BCR-ABL induced transformation, thereby accelerating leukemogenesis.

Identification of molecular target(s) and mechanism(s) of silica-induced pulmonary toxicity is important for the intervention and/or prevention of diseases associated with occupational exposure to crystalline silica. Rats were exposed to crystalline silica by inhalation (15 mg/m3, 6 h/day, 5 days) and global gene expression profile was determined in the lungs by microarray analysis at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks following termination of silica exposure. The number of significantly differentially expressed genes (>1.5 fold change and <0.01 FDR p value) detected in the lungs during the post-exposure time intervals analyzed exhibited a steady increase in parallel with the progression of silica-induced pulmonary toxicity noticed in the rats. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of a representative set of 10 genes confirmed the microarray findings. The various biological functions, canonical pathways, and molecular networks affected by silica exposure, as identified by the bioinformatics analysis of the significantly differentially expressed genes, also exhibited a steady increase similar to the silica-induced pulmonary toxicity. Genes involved in oxidative stress, inflammation, respiratory diseases, cancer, and tissue remodeling and fibrosis were significantly differentially expressed in the rat lungs; however, unresolved lung inflammation was the single most significant biological response to pulmonary exposure to crystalline silica. Excessive mucus production, as implicated by significant overexpression of the pendrin coding gene, SLC26A4, was identified as a novel mechanism for silica-induced pulmonary toxicity. Collectively, the findings of our study provided insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of crystalline silica-induced pulmonary toxicity in the rat and these findings may be useful in future to develop strategies to prevent occupational silicosis. A total of 60 rat lung samples were analyzed in this gene expression experiment. Rats were exposed to crystalline silica at a concentration of 15 mg/m3, 6-hours/day for 5 consecutive days.

Overexpression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) has been reported in both malignant and premalignant breast lesions, and has been associated with poor outcome. FAS has gained interest as a metabolic target for the treatment of breast cancer based on evidence that blockade with the antifungal antibiotic, cerulenin or synthetic inhibitor C75 inhibits proliferation of breast cancer cells and delays tumor development. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a class of fatty acids found in beef and dairy products, has been shown to inhibit FAS in bovine mammary adipose. Based on previously well-documented anti-tumor activity of CLA, we hypothesized that one mechanism of CLA's anti-tumorigenic activity may be metabolic blockade of FAS. We fed virgin PyV-MT transgenic mice a diet supplemented with either 1% CLA, as mixed isomers, or control chow for four weeks. Tissue histology was determined by H&E staining. cDNA microarray and real-time quantitative PCR were performed to determine relative expression of lipogenic genes. Western blots were used to examine relative protein expression of FAS. Differences in protein densitometry were analyzed using Students 2-sided T-test. Probability was determined using the binomial sign test. Level of significance for all tests was 0.05. H&E staining revealed a shift towards advanced mammary lesions in the CLA-fed mice compared to control animals (24/26 vs. 11/26) (p for trend < 0.001). Microarray analysis revealed a >2-fold decrease in FAS in the CLA-fed group compared to controls, and was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (p < 0.001) and Western blot. The decrease in FAS mRNA expression was unexpectedly associated with more advanced disease (p for trend < 0.01). Conclusions: Dietary CLA suppressed fatty acid synthase in the mammary glands of the PyV-MT mouse while promoting mammary tumor progression.Keywords: dietary intervention to compare mammary tumorigenesis between groups. PyV-MT and wild type FVB mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bay Harbor, ME) and housed 2-4 per cage in micro insulator rooms.

High levels of ambient ozone have been associated with decreased lung function and increased exacerbations of asthma in children and adults. However, the effects of ozone on the newborn's lung are largely unknown. This study was aimed at profiling the newborn lung response to ozone at the transcriptome level to define the impact of ozone pollutant on the developing postnatal lung. Newborn mice were exposed to ozone or filtered normal air for 3 h. Total RNA was isolated from lung tissues at 6 and 24 h after completion of exposure and was subjected to gene expression analysis using Whole Mouse Genome Gene Expression 4X44K Microarrays (G2519F-014868, Agilent Technologies). Transcriptome analysis of the postnatal lung indicated that 455 genes were down-regulated and 166 genes were up-regulated by at least 1.5 fold at 6 h post-ozone exposure (t-test, p<0.05). At 24 h post exposure, 543 genes were down-regulated and 323 genes were up-regulated in the lungs of ozone-exposed newborn mice, compared to filtered air-exposed newborn mice (t-test, p<0.05). After controlling for false discovery rate, 50 genes were significantly down-regulated and only 4 genes were up-regulated at 24 h post ozone-exposure (q<0.05). Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that cell cycle-associated functions including cell division/proliferation, cellular assembly and organization were the predominant pathways negatively regulated by ozone exposure. These findings suggest that elevated ozone pollution may interfere with lung development and growth in the early age. Three-day old BALB/c mice were exposed for 3 h to ozone (1000 parts per billion). Age-matching littermate controls were exposed for 3 h to filtered normal air. Whole lung tissue was collected 6 and 24 h after completion of exposure to ozone or filtered air and was subjected to microarray analysis. Each time point was performed separately with its own filtered air littermate controls. Pups were cross-fostered during exposure so that all pups were with a dam during exposure.

Here we report a critical role of osteoclastic ERa in mediating estrogen action on bone in females. We selectively ablated ERa in differentiated osteoclasts (ERa dOc/dOc). ERa dOc/dOc females, but not males, exhibited clear trabecular bone loss, similar to the osteoporotic bone phenotype in post-menopausal women. Recovery of bone loss by estrogen treatment of the ovariectomized ERa dOc/dOc females was ineffective in the trabecular areas of the long bones and lumbar vertebral bodies. Osteoclastic apoptosis, induced by estrogen, occurred simultaneously with up-regulation of Fas ligand (FasL) expression in intact trabecular bones of ERa +/+mice, but not in ERa dOc/dOc mice. ERa was also required for similar effects of estrogen and tamoxifen in cultured osteoclasts. These findings suggest that the osteoprotective actions of estrogen and SERMS are mediated at least in part through osteoclastic ERa in trabecular bone; and the life span of mature osteoclasts is regulated through activation of the Fas/FasL system.Keywords: Study about estrogen response of osteoclast-specific estrogen receptor alpha mice.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are maternally inherited and are associated with a broad range of debilitating and fatal diseases. Assisted reproductive technologies designed to uncouple the inheritance of mtDNA from nuclear DNA may enable women who carry mtDNA mutations to have a genetically related child with a greatly reduced risk of disease. Here we report for the first time that pronuclear transplantation (PNT) between normally fertilised human zygotes provides an effective approach to preventing transmission of mtDNA disease. We found that the procedures previously used to perform PNT between abnormally fertilized human zygotes are highly inefficient when applied to those that undergo normal fertilization. We have therefore developed an alternative approach based on transplanting PN shortly after completion of the second meiotic division rather than shortly before onset of the first mitosis. This approach promotes highly efficient development to the blastocyst stage without affecting nuclear genome integrity. Furthermore, the expression profile of genes encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes was indistinguishable from unmanipulated control embryos. Importantly, levels of mtDNA transferred with the nuclear genome are below the threshold for mtDNA disease. Together these data indicate that transplantation of pronuclei early in the first cell cycle holds promise as a safe and effective approach to preventing transmission of mtDNA disease.

    "text": "Functional genomics of central nervous system and liver following herpes simplex virus corneal infection. The overall goal of the study was to use in vivo data combined with functional genomics to define gene expression signatures representative of a spectrum of HSV CNS infections.Innate immune deficiencies result in a spectrum of severe clinical outcomes following infection. In particular, there is a strong association between loss of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) pathway, breach of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and virus-induced neuropathology. The gene signatures that characterize resistance, disease, and mortality in the virus-infected nervous system have not been defined. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is commonly associated with encephalitis in humans, and humans and mice lacking Stat1 display increased susceptibility to HSV central nervous system (CNS) infections. In this study, two HSV-1 strains were used, KOS (wild type [WT]), and Dvhs, an avirulent recombinant lacking the virion host shutoff (vhs) function. In addition, two mouse strains were used: strain 129 (control) and a Stat1-deficient (Stat1(-/-)) strain. Using combinations of these virus and mouse strains, we established a model of infection resulting in three different outcomes: viral clearance without neurological disease (Dvhs infection of control mice), neurological disease followed by viral clearance (Dvhs infection of Stat1(-/-) mice and WT infection of control mice), or neurological disease followed by death (WT infection of Stat1(-/-) mice). Through the use of functional genomics on the infected brain stem and liver, we determined gene signatures that were representative of the three infection outcomes. Gender matched, 6- to 8- week old immunocompetent, control 129S6 and 129S6 Stat1 knockout mice were infected corneally with 2x10^6 PFU of either wild type HSV-1, a vhs-null HSV virus, or mock-infected. Brain stems and liver of individual mice were isolated at days 1, 3, 5 and 7 post-inoculation for microarray analysis. For microarray analysis, samples were collected from n=2 animals (1 male, 1 female) per mouse strain and virus strain for each time point. Equal masses of tissue were pooled from two mock-infected mice per time point and run on microarray.",

Mice possessing the lethal yellow (LY) agouti mutation (C57BL/6J Ay/a) exhibit adult-onset obesity, altered metabolic regulation, and early reproductive senescence. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that aging obese mice possess differences in expression of ovarian genes involved in reproductive function relative to age-matched lean mice. To synchronize ovarian state and exclude gonadotropin-mediated effects, 90- and 180-day old diestrous LY and lean black (C57BL/6J a/a) mice were suppressed with GnRH antagonist (Antide(r)) for five days, then injected with 5 IU equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG). Complementary RNA derived from RNA extracts of whole ovarian homogenates collected 36h post eCG were run individually on CodeLink Mouse Whole Genome Bioarrays (Applied Microarrays). Unidentified genes, EST, genes whose expression was below sensitivity limits, and those with less than a 2-fold difference in expression between groups were excluded from analysis. After exclusions, 52 genes had a significant (p<0.05) difference in expression between 180-day-old obese LY and lean black mice. LY exhibited elevated ovarian expression of agouti (350x), leptin (6.5x), and numerous genes involved in cholesterol/lipid transport and metabolism, e.g., lanosterol synthase, CYP51, and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). Fewer genes showed lower expression in LY mice, e.g. angiotensinogen. In contrast, none of these genes showed differential expression in 90-day-old LY and black mice, which are of similar body weight. Interestingly, 180-day-old LY mice had a 2-fold greater expression of 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) type 1 and a 2-fold lesser expression of 11b-HSD type 2, differences not seen in 90-day-old mice. Consistent with altered 11b-HSD expression, ovarian concentrations of corticosterone (C) were elevated in aging (180-day) LY mice relative to black mice, but C levels were similar in young (90-day) LY and black mice.

At 36 hours after the Antide injections, the mice were stimulated to ovulate with an injection of eCG. At 36 hours after eCG injection the mice were euthanized and the ovaries collected. One ovary from each animal was preserved in RNAlater for DNA microarray analysis.Quality control steps: The cRNA that was synthesized from each ovary was used for hybridization to a single CodeLink (Applied Microarrays) Whole Mouse Genome microarray. Only one sample was hybridized with each slide and only one dye (Alexa 647) was used so no dye swaps were necessary. Bacterial control spikes were used as per manufacturer's instructions.Samples used, extract preparation and labelling:The origin of each biological sample: Ovaries of mice with the lethal yellow mutation in the agouti gene (C57BL/6J Ay/a) and their non-mutated black littermates (C57BL6 a/a) (n=3 per group).Manipulations of biological samples and protocols used: The ovarian cycles of 90- and 180-day old mice with the lethal yellow mutation in the agouti gene (C57BL/6J Ay/a) and their non-mutated black littermates (C57BL6 a/a) (n=3 per group) were synchronized with the GnRH antagonist, Antide.

One ovary from each animal was preserved in RNAlater for DNA microarray analysis.Experimental factor: age, presence vs absence of LY mutationTechnical protocols: The ovaries were collected into RNAlater (Ambion) and stored at -80C until processed. The RNAlater was blotted from the ovaries and each was individually homogenized in TRI reagent (MRC). Bromochloropropane and sodium acetate were added, and the samples were centrifuged to separate the phases. The RNA-containing layer was removed and the RNA purified on an RNeasy extraction column (Qiagen). The sample was treated with an on-column DNase treatment (RNase-free DNase, Qiagen). The purity and quantity were evaluated by an Agilent Bioanalyzer using the RNA 6000 Nanoassay LabChip.Labelled cRNA was prepared using the manufacturer's Instruction Protocol (www1.amershambiosciences.com, CodeLink Gene Expression System: Manual Labelled cRNA Target Preparation). The source of reagents was the CodeLink Expression Assay Reagent Kit, Manual Prep, except where specified otherwise. 2.0 micrograms of total endometrial cell RNA was mixed with bacterial control RNA spikes and primed with T7 oligo(dT) primer for 10 min at 70C. (The bacterial control spikes included araB, entF, fixB, gnd, hisB, and leuB.) The first strand of cDNA was synthesized with first strand buffer, dNTP mix, RNase inhibitor, and reverse transcriptase for 2 h at 42C. The second strand cDNA synthesis reaction was prepared using second strand buffer, dNTP mix, DNA polymerase mix, and RNase H; the reaction was carried out for 2h at 16C. The double-stranded cDNA was purified on QIAquick columns (Qiagen) and the eluent was dried down in a SpeedVac concentrator. The double-stranded cDNA was resuspended in a mixture containing T7 reaction buffer, T7 ATP, T7 GTP, T7 UTP, T7 CTP, biotin-11-UTP, and T7 enzyme mix for the synthesis of cRNA. The cRNA synthesis reaction was terminated after 14h at 37C by purifying the cRNA on RNeasy columns (Qiagen). The concentration of cRNA was determined by spectrophotometry.Hybridization procedures and parameters: 10 micrograms of cRNA was mixed with fragmentation buffer and heated to 94C for 20 min. The fragmented cRNA was mixed with CodeLink hybridization buffer, loaded on the microarray slides, and hybridized for 18 hours at 37C.The slides were washed in 0.75x TNT (Tris-HCl, NaCl, Tween-20) at 46C for 1h then incubated with streptavidin-Alexa 647 fluorescent dye for 30 min at room temperature. The Alexa fluor was prepared in TNB blocking buffer (0.1M Tris-HCl, 0.15M NaCL, 0.5% NEN Blocking Reagent-PerkinElmer) The slides were then washed 4 times for 5 min each in 1x TNT and twice in 0.05% Tween 20 for 5 sec each.

The Ewing Sarcoma protein (EWS) is a multifaceted RNA binding protein (RBP) with established roles in transcription, pre-mRNA processing, and DNA damage response. By generating high quality EWS-RNA interactome, we uncovered its specific and prevalent interaction with a large subset of primary microRNAs (pri-miRNA). Depletion of EWS reduced, while overexpression enhanced, the expression of its target miRNAs. Biochemical analysis revealed that multiple elements in target pri-miRNAs, including the sequences flanking the stem-loop region, contribute to EWS binding and sequence swap between target and non-target demonstrated that the flanking sequences provide the specificity for enhanced pri-miRNA processing by the Microprocessor Drosha/DGCR8. Interestingly, as previously reported and we confirmed, EWS appears to repress Drosha expression, and we further demonstrated that EWS is able to enhance the recruitment of Drosha to the chromatin. Together, these findings suggest that EWS may positively and negatively regulate miRNA biogenesis, but via distinct mechanisms, thus providing a new foundation to understand the function of EWS in development and disease.

    "text": "The Chromatin-Looping Factor ZNF143 Engages at Looping Promoters to Favor the Estrogen Response in Breast Cancer (RNA-seq). Estrogen signaling in breast cancer cells relies on long-range chromatin interactions connecting distal regulatory elements bound by the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) to target gene promoters. This ensures stimulus and subtype-specific transcriptional responses. Expanding on the function of CTCF and the cohesin complex in breast cancer, we demonstrate that the chromatin-looping factor ZNF143 binds the promoter of most early-response estrogen target genes connected to distal regulatory elements in ESR1-positive breast cancer cells. Its chromatin occupancy is unaffected by estrogen stimulation, supporting a stable three-dimensional genomic architecture within the early response to estrogen. Its loss abrogates the estrogen-induced transcriptional response and growth of breast cancer cells. When taking into account CTCF, ZNF143 and cohesin complex subunits, we show that chromatin-looping factors are genetically altered in over 20% of ESR1-positive primary breast tumors. Furthermore, the overexpression of ZNF143, CTCF and RAD21, a cohesin complex subunit, in ESR1-positive breast tumors associates with a worse clinical outcome. Overall, our results suggest that ZNF143 is a new critical effector of the estrogen response and highlights the contribution of the chromatin looping machinery to ESR1-positive breast cancer development. mRNA profiles of MCF-7 cells (siCtl or siZNF143) under vehicle (EtOH) or E2 (10 uM 17-beta oestradiol) stimulation.",

A two by two design was used to test the effect of Rosi treatment on the development of DN. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic DBA/2J mice were treated with Rosi. DN and oxidative stress were quantified, and gene expression was profiled using the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 microarray platform. An informatics approach identified key regulatory elements activated by Rosi. Diabetic DBA/2J mice developed severe hyperglycemia, DN and elevated oxidative stress. Rosi treatment did not affect hyperglycemia but did reduce oxidative stress and prevented development of thermal hypoalgesia.

Success of immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has invigorated their use in neo-adjuvant setting for early-stage disease. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the early immune responses to therapy remain poorly understood. Through an integrated analysis of early-stage NSCLC patients and a Kras-mutant mouse model, we show a prevalent programmed cell death 1/ programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) axis exemplified by increased intratumoral PD-1+ T cells and PD-L1 expression. Notably, tumor progression was associated with spatiotemporal modulation of the immune microenvironment. Importantly, PD-1 inhibition controlled tumor growth, improved overall survival, and reprogrammed tumor-associated lymphoid and myeloid cells. Depletion of T lymphocyte subsets demonstrated synergistic effects of those populations on PD-1 inhibition of tumor growth. Transcriptome analyses revealed T cell subset-specific alterations corresponding to degree of response to the treatment. These results provide insights into temporal evolution of the phenotypic effects of PD-1/PD-L1 activation and inhibition, and motivate targeting this axis early in lung cancer progression. CD4 and CD8 lung tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were sorted into RLT lysis buffer from IgG antibody or anti-PD1 antibody treated C57Bl/6 mice at day 14, 17 or 24 for mRNA-Sequencing.",

It has been proposed that the pathogenesis of HF may involve the action of mitochondria. Here we evaluate three different models of HF: tachycardiomyopathy, HF with preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, and LV myocardial ischemia and hypertrophy. Regardless of whether LVEF is preserved or reduced, our results indicate that the three models share common molecular features: an increase in mitochondrial ROS, followed by ultrastructural alterations in the mitochondrial cristae and loss of mitochondrial integrity that lead to cardiomyocyte death. We show that the ablation of the mitochondrial protease OMA1 averts cardiomyocyte death in all three experimental HF models, and thus, plays a direct role in cardiomyocyte protection. This finding identifies OMA1 as a potential target for preventing the progression of myocardial damage in HF associated to a variety of etiologies.

Obesity and diabetes associated visual impairment and vascular dysfunctions are increasing reasons for vision loss. The detailed mechanisms in these diseases are still largely unknown, but mice models have been useful to study these mechanisms and explore the detailed effects of potential compounds. Such compounds usually have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.These properties are found in anthocyanins and a major source of dietary anthocyanins in Nordic diet is bilberries (European wild blueberries, Vaccinium myrtillus). In this explorative study we show results with differentially expressed genes in retina using a high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model. Our findings displayed differential regulation of genes in pathways for apoptosis, inflammation and oxidative stress, especially systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and glutathione metabolism. Mice fed with HFD had increased retinal gene expression of several crystallins, which was reduced in the retina of mice fed with bilberries. Bilberries seem to reduce the expression of genes in MAPK and to increase the expression of genes in glutathione metabolism pathway. All together despite minor effects in the mouse phenotype, a diet rich in bilberries may prevent the retinal gene expression changes in the early stages of obesity. Mice were fed ad libitum with normal control diet (NCD, 10% kcal fat), high-fat diet (HFD, 45% kcal fat), 5% (w/w) freeze-dried biberries (Vaccinium myrtillus) in NCD (NCD+BB) or HFD (HFD+BB) for 12 weeks.

On a pure genetic background, compared to wild-types, Del/+ mice carrying the deletion showed weight and adipogenesis deficits, hyperactivity, repetitive behaviors, and recognition memory deficits, whereas Dup/+ mice showed the opposite phenotypes and Del/Dup individuals displayed no changes. Alterations in social interaction were also observed in Del/+ and Dup/+ animals on a mixed genetic background.Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the majority of genes located on the Sult1a1-Spn were dosage-sensitive and potentially implicated in the opposite phenotypes described above on the neurocognitive aspect. Nevertheless, the outcome of the 16p11 region genetic dosage on metabolism depends on different genetic contributions between human and mouse.

Deep sequencing was performed to screen differentially expressed microRNAs between HCC (n=5) and liver cirrhosis (LC, n=5) group. Three upregulated and two downregulated microRNAs were selected for qPCR analysis. The levels of selected microRNAs were normalized to Caenorhabditis elegans miR-39 microRNA mimics.

The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate diagnostic perfromance of candidate microRNAs. Area under the curve (AUC) of miR-148a was 0.891 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.809-0.947] in discriminating HCC from LC, remarkably higher than alpha fetoprotein (AFP) (AUC: 0.712, 95 % CI: 0.607-0.803). Binary logistic regression was adpoted to establish the diagnostic model for discriminating HCC from LC. And the combination of miR-122, miR-148a and AFP increased the AUC to 0.931 (95% CI, 0.857-0.973), which can also be applied for distinguishing early HCC from LC. miR-122 was the best for differentiating HCC from NC (AUC: 0.990, 95% CI, 0.945-1.000).

Overall, the induction of lncRNAs and mRNAs was increased by pretreatment with all three radioprotectants. Amifostine treatment led to a similar expression pattern of lncRNAs, and mRNAs to that of CBLB502 but not to that of nilestriol. The radioprotectants exhibited mostly opposite effects against IR-induced lncRNAs, and mRNAs in bone marrow, and might induce a potential common mechanism of histone gene downregulation only in the face of IR, mainly via nucleosome assembly and related signaling pathways, which may be a common response to IR-induced biological changes and could explain the radioprotection mechanism.

Accumulating evidence indicates that altered miRNA expression is crucially involved in lung cancer development, but only little has been elucidated about how MYC, an archetypical oncogene, is regulated by miRNAs, especially through a mechanism involving the MYC cofactor(s). In this study, we aimed at identifying miRNAs involved in the regulation of MYC transcriptional activity in lung cancers. To this end, we have taken an integrative approach with combinatorial usage of miRNA and mRNA expression profile datasets of patients' tumor tissues as well as those of MYC-inducible cell lines in vitro. We report here that in addition to miRNAs previously reported to be directly regulating or regulated by MYC including let-7 and miR-17-92, our strategy allowed us to identify miR-342-3p as the one capable of indirectly regulating MYC activity through direct repression of a MYC-cooperating molecule, E2F1. Furthermore, the miR-342-3p module activity, which we defined as a gene set reflecting experimentally substantiated influence of miR-342-3p on mRNA expression, was found to be inversely correlated with MYC activity reflected in the MYC module activity in three independent datasets of lung adenocarcinoma patients obtained by the Director's Challenge Consortium of the United States (P=1.94x10-73), the National Cancer Center of Japan (P=9.05x10-34) and our own in this study (P=3.37x10-6).

Most colorectal cancers (CRC) arise in a progression through adenoma to carcinoma phenotypes as a consequence of altered genetic information. Clinical progression of CRC may occur in parallel with distinctive signaling alterations. We designed multidirectional analyses integrating microarray-based data with biostatistics and bioinformatics to elucidate the signaling and metabolic alterations underlying CRC development in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Methodology/Principal Findings. Studies were performed on normal mucosa, adenoma, and CRC samples obtained during surgery or colonoscopy. Collections of cryostat sections prepared from the tissue samples were evaluated by a pathologist to control the relative cell type content. RNA was isolated from 105 macro- and 40 microdissected specimens. The measurements were done using Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133plus2, and probe set data were generated using two normalization algorithms: MAS5 and GCRMA with LVS. The data were evaluated using pair-wise comparisons and data decomposition into SVD modes. The method selected for the functional analysis used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Based on a consensus of the results obtained by two tissue handling procedures, two normalization algorithms, and two probe set sorting criteria, we identified six KEGG signaling and metabolic pathways (cell cycle, DNA replication, p53 signaling pathway, purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, and RNA polymerase) that are significantly altered in both macro- and microdissected tumor samples compared to normal colon. On the other hand, pathways altered between benign and malignant tumors were identified only in the macrodissected tissues. Conclusion/Significance. Multidirectional analyses of microarray data allow the identification of essential signaling alterations underlying CRC development.

Protein Arginine MethylTransferase 5 (PRMT5) is known to mediate epigenetic control on chromatin and to functionally regulate components of the splicing machinery. In this study we show that selective deletion of PRMT5 in different organs leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. At the molecular level, PRMT5 depletion results in reduced methylation of Sm proteins, aberrant constitutive splicing and in the Alternative Splicing (AS) of specific mRNAs. We identify Mdm4 as one of these mRNAs, which due to its weak 5'-Donor site, acts as a sensor of splicing defects and transduces the signal to activate the p53 response, providing a mechanistic explanation of the phenotype observed in PRMT5 conditional knockout mice. Our data demonstrate a key role of PRMT5, together with p53, as guardians of the transcriptome.

Purpose: To better understand the function of the various cell types of the brain, we prospectively purified neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, newly formed oligodendrocytes, myelinating oligodendrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, and pericytes from mouse cerebral cortex. We generated a transcriptome database for these 8 cell types by RNA sequencing and used a highly sensitive algorithm to detect alternative splicing events in each gene. Our analysis identified thousands of new cell type enriched genes and splicing isoforms that will provide novel markers for cell identification, new tools for genetic manipulation, and numerous insights into the biology of the brain.Method Part1:To purify astrocytes, we took advantage of a BAC transgenic mouse line expressing EGFP under the control of regulatory sequences in Aldh1l1-BAC. This line has been previously characterized to have complete astrocyte-specific labeling throughout the brain. Cells from a litter of 8-16 P7 Aldh1l1-EGFP transgenic mice of both genders were pooled together as one biological replicate. The cortices were dissected out and meninges were removed. The tissue was enzymatically dissociated to make a suspension of single cells as described previously. Briefly, the tissue was incubated at 33 degC for 45 minutes in 20 ml of a papain solution containing Earle's balanced salts (EBSS, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, E7510), D(+)-glucose (22.5mM), NaHCO3 (26mM), DNase (125U/ml, Worthington, Lakewood, NJ, LS002007), papain (9 U/ml, Worthington, Lakewood, NJ, LS03126), and L-cysteine (1mM, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, C7880). The papain solution was equilibrated with 5% CO2 and 95% O2 gas before and during papain treatment. Following papain treatment, the tissue was washed three times with 4.5ml of inhibitor buffer containing BSA (1.0mg/ml, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, A-8806), and ovomucoid (also known as trypsin inhibitor, 1.0 mg/ml, Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, IN 109878) and then mechanically dissociated by gentle sequential trituration using a 5ml pipette. Dissociated cells were layered on top of 10ml of high concentration inhibitor solution with 5mg/ml BSA and 5mg/ml ovomucoid and centrifuged at 130g for 5 minutes. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 12 ml Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA 14287) containing 0.02% BSA and 12.5U/ml DNase and filtered through a 20um Nitex mesh (Sefar America Inc., Depew NY, Lab Pak 03-20/14) to remove undissociated cell clumps. This yields a single cell suspension. Cell health is assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Only single cell suspensions with >85% viability were used for purification experiments. 1mg/ml propidium iodide (PI, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, P4864) was added to the single cell solution to label dead cells. Cells were sorted on a BD Aria II cell sorter (BD Bioscience) with a 70mm nozzle. Dead cells and debris were gated first by their low forward light scatter and high side light scatter and secondly by high PI staining. Doublets were removed by high side light scatter. Cell concentration and flow rate were carefully adjusted to maximize purity. Astrocytes were identified based on high EGFP fluorescence. FACS routinely yielded >99% purity based on reanalysis of sorted cells.Method Part2:To purify neurons, a single cell suspension was prepared as described above and incubated at 34 degC for one hour to allow expression of cell surface protein antigens digested by papain, and then incubated on two sequential panning plates coated with BSL-1 to deplete endothelial cells (10 minutes each), followed by a 30 minute incuation on a plate coated with mouse IgM anti-O4 hybridoma (Bansal et al., 1989. 4ml hybridoma supernatant diluted with 8ml DPBS/0.2% BSA) to deplete OPCs, and then incubated for 20 minutes on a plate coated with rat anti-mouse CD45 (BD Pharmingen 550539, 1.25ug in 12ml of DPBS/0.2% BSA) to deplete microglia and macrophages. Finally cells were added to a plate coated with rat anti-mouse L1CAM (30ug in 12ml of DPBS/0.2% BSA, Millipore, Billerica, MA, MAB5272) to bind neurons. The adherent cells on the L1CAM plate were washed 8 times with 10-20 ml of DPBS to remove all antigen-negative nonadherent cells, and then removed from the plate by treating with trypsin (Sigma, 1,000U/ml, T-4665) in 8ml Ca2+ and Mg2+ free EBSS (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA, 9208) for 3-10 minutes at 37degC in a 10% CO2 incubator. The trypsin was then neutralized with 20ml of fetal calf serum (FCS) solution containing 30% FCS (Gibco, 10437-028), 35% Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM, Invitrogen, 11960-044), and 35% Neurobasal (Gibco, 21103-049). The cells were dislodged by gentle squirting of FCS solution over the plate and harvested by centrifugation at 200g for 10 minutes.Method Part3:To purify microglia and oligodendrocyte-lineage cells, the mice were first perfused with 10ml PBS to remove macrophage contamination from the brain. A single cell suspension was then prepared as described above and incubated 20 minutes on a plate coated with rat anti-mouse CD45 (BD Pharmingen 550539, 1.25ug in 12ml of DPBS/0.2% BSA) to harvest microglia, and then incubated sequentially on four BSL1 coated plates (8 minutes each) to deplete endothelial cells and remaining microglia. The remaining cells were next incubated for 30 minutes on a rat anti-PDGFRa (10ug in 12ml DPBS/0.2% BSA, Fitzgerald, Acton, MA, 10R-CD140aMS) coated plate to harvest OPCs, and then incubated on an additional PDGFRa plate and mouse A2B5 monoclonal antibody ascites (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) coated plate for 30 minutes each to deplete remaining OPCs. The cell suspension was next incubated on an anti-MOG hybridoma coated plate for 30 minutes to harvest myelinating oligodendrocytes, followed by an additional anti-MOG hybridoma coated plate for 30 minutes to deplete any remaining myelinating oligodendrocytes. Finally, the cell suspension was incubated on an anti-GalC hybridoma coated plate for 30 minutes to harvest newly formed oligodendrocytes. For purification of RNA, the cells were lysed while still attached to the panning plate with Qiazol reagent (Qiagen 217004), and total RNA was purified as described below.Mehtod Part4:To purify endothelial cells, we took advantage of Tie2-EGFP transgenic mice available from Jackson labs. These mice express EGFP under the pan-endothelial Tie2 promotor (Daneman et al., 2010; Motoike et al., 2000). Single cell suspension was prepared and FACS was performed as described above.Method Part5: RNA-Seq was performed on the polyadenylated fraction of RNA isolated from purified cell samples.Two biological replicates were used for each phase.100 ng total RNAs were used for each sequencing library. RNA samples were polyA selected and paired-end sequencing libraries were constructed using TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit as described in the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation V2 Guide (Illumina).The samples were then sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer.Method Part6: Read mapping and Transcriptome construction were done by using optimized pipeline which integrate Tophat followed by Cufflinks.Result:We purified neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), newly formed oligodendrocytes (NFOs), myelinating oligodendrocytes (MOs), microglia, endothelial cells and pericytes from mouse cortex and used RNA-Seq to generate a high resolution transcriptome database of > 22,000 genes. We identified thousands of novel cell type-enriched genes that have not been previously identified. These include novel transcription factors, ligands, receptors, enzymes, and signaling molecules. We then used a novel splice mapping algorithm to identify thousands of cell type-specific alternative splicing events.Conclusion:We generated a transcriptome database for these 8 cell types by RNA sequencing and used a highly sensitive algorithm to detect alternative splicing events in each gene. Our analysis i. mRNA profiles of purified cell samples from mice were generated by RNA-sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000.",

The phosphorylation of eIF4E1 at serine 209 by MNK1 or MNK2 has been shown to initiate oncogenic mRNA translation, a process that favours cancer development and maintenance. Here, we interrogate the MNK-eIF4E axis in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and show a distinct distribution of MNK1 and MNK2 in germinal centre B-cell (GCB) and activated B-cell (ABC) DLBCL. Despite displaying a differential distribution in GCB and ABC, both MNKs functionally complement each other to sustain cell survival. MNK inhibition ablates eIF4E1 phosphorylation and concurrently enhances eIF4E3 expression. Loss of MNK protein itself down-regulates total eIF4E1 protein level by reducing eIF4E1 mRNA polysomal loading without affecting total mRNA level or stability. Enhanced eIF4E3 expression marginally suppresses eIF4E1-driven translation but exhibits a unique translatome that unveils a novel role for eIF4E3 in translation initiation. Together, we propose that MNKs can modulate oncogenic translation by regulating eIF4E1-eIF4E3 levels and activity in DLBCL. As the knockdown of eIF4E1 or eIF4E3 caused significant cell death, we overexpressed either protein in HLY-1 cells and performed sucrose density gradient fractionation. RNA was extracted from polysome fractions #9-10, containing highly translated polysome-bound mRNAs, from total RNA and from an empty vector control. These samples, in triplicate, were used for either translatome or transcriptome analysis using Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 BeadChips for gene expression analysis.",

    "text": "Tristetraprolin disables prostate cancer maintenance by impairing proliferation and metabolic function. Tristetraprolin (TTP) is an RNA-binding protein that post-transcriptionally suppresses gene expression by delivering mRNA cargo to processing bodies (P-bodies) where the mRNA is degraded. TTP functions as a tumor suppressor in a mouse model of B cell lymphoma, and in some human malignancies low TTP expression correlates with reduced survival. Here we report important prognostic and functional roles for TTP in human prostate cancer. First, gene expression analysis of prostate tumors revealed low TTP expression correlates with patients having high-risk Gleason scores and increased biochemical recurrence. Second, in prostate cancer cells with low levels of endogenous TTP, inducible TTP expression inhibits their growth and proliferation, as well as their clonogenic growth. Third, TTP functions as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer, as forced TTP expression markedly impairs the tumorigenic potential of prostate cancer cells in a mouse xenograft model. Finally, pathway analysis of gene expression data suggested metabolism is altered by TTP expression in prostate tumor cells, and metabolic analyses revealed that such processes are impaired by TTP, including mitochondrial respiration. Collectively, these findings suggest that TTP is an important prognostic indicator for prostate cancer, and augmenting TTP function would effectively disable the metabolism and proliferation of aggressive prostate tumors. PC-3 cells were infected with a pRetroX-Tet-On-Advanced retrovirus and selected for by G418 resistance. Then the G418-resistant cells were secondarily infected with either a pRetroX-Tight-pPGK-tdTomato or a pRetroX-Tight-TTP-pPGK-tdTomato retrovirus and selected for by the expression of tdTomato. G418-resistant, tdTomato-positive cells were used for experiments, in triplicate for each cell type. Cells were treated with 300 ng/ml doxycycline (Dox) for 4h prior to collection.

Ewing sarcoma (ES) is the second most common bone malignancy affecting children and young adults with poor prognosis due to high metastasis incidence. Our group previously described that EphA2, a tyrosine kinase receptor, promotes angiogenesis in ES cells via ligand-dependent signaling. EphA2 ligand-independent activity, controlled upon phosphorylation at S897 (p-EphA2S897), has been linked to metastasis in several malignancies. Here, we stablish a correlation between ES cells aggressiveness and p-EphA2S897. Moreover, stable overexpression of EphA2 in low EphA2 expression ES cells enhanced proliferation and migration, but not a nonphosphorylable mutant (S987A). Consistently, silencing of EphA2 reduced tumorigenicity, migration and invasion in vitro, and lung metastasis incidence in experimental and spontaneous metastasis assays in vivo. A gene expression microarray revealed the implication of EphA2 in cell signaling, cellular movement and survival. Altogether, our results suggest that p-EphA2S897 correlates with aggressiveness in ES, so blocking its function may be a promising treatment. 9 samples were analyzed: A673 parental or transfected with control shRNA (n=2); TC252 parental or transfected with control shRNA (n=2); A673 transfected with EphA2 shRNA (n=2), TC252 transfected with EphA2 shRNA (n=3),.",

We investigated hepatocarcinogenesis in Mdr2-KO mice, a model of inflammation-associated HCC, using gene expression profiling and immunohistochemical analyses. Gene expression profiling demonstrated that although Mdr2-KO mice differ from other published murine HCC models, they share several important deregulated pathways and many coordinately differentially expressed genes with human HCC datasets. Analysis of genome positions of differentially expressed genes in liver tumors revealed a prolonged region of down-regulated genes on murine chromosome 8 in three of the six analyzed tumor samples. This region is syntenic to human chromosomal regions that are frequently deleted in human HCC and harbor multiple tumor suppressor genes. Real-time RT-PCR analysis of 16 tumor samples confirmed down-regulation of several tumor suppressors in most tumors. We demonstrate that in the aged Mdr2-KO mice, cyclin D1 nuclear level is increased in dysplastic hepatocytes that do not form nodules; however, it is decreased in dysplastic nodules and in liver tumors. We found that this decrease is mostly at the protein, rather than the mRNA level. These findings raise the question on the role of cyclin D1 at early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis in the Mdr2-KO HCC model. Furthermore, we show that most liver tumors in Mdr2-KO mice were characterized by the absence of b-catenin activation. In conclusion, the Mdr2-KO mouse may serve as a model for b-catenin-negative subgroup of human HCCs characterized by low nuclear cyclin D1 levels in tumor cells and by down-regulation of multiple tumor suppressor genes.Keywords: Hepatocellular carcinoma, Mouse model, Mdr2-knockout.

Bacterial infection in the mammary gland parenchyma induces local inflammation that can lead to a multietiological complex disease called mastitis. Globally Staphylococcus aureus is the single largest mastitis pathogen and the infection can ultimately result in either subclinical or chronic and sometimes lifelong infection. In the present report we have addressed the differential inflammatory response in the mice mammary tissue during intramammary infection and the altered epigenetic context induced by two closely related strains of S. aureus. Immunohistochemical and immunoblot analysis showed strain specific hyperacetylation at histone H3K9 and H3K14 residues. Real-time PCR and genome-wide gene expression studied showed expression of a set of proinflammatory genes and cytokines in a temporal manner. Remarkably, over expression of the genes significantly correlated with the promoter specific acetylation in these residues. Furthermore, we have identified several differentially expressed known miRNAs and 4 novel miRNAs in the S. aureus infected mice mammary tissue by small RNA sequencing. By employing these gene expression data, an attempt has been made to delineate the gene regulatory networks in the strain specific inflammatory response. Apparently, one of the isolates of S. aureus activated the NFkB signaling leading to drastic inflammatory response and induction of immune surveillance, which could lead to rapid clearance of the pathogen. The other strain repressed most of the inflammatory response, which might help in its sustenance in the host tissue. Taken together, our studies shed substantial lights to understand the mechanisms of strain specific differential inflammatory response to S. aureus infection during mastitis.

The use of integrated approaches in genetic toxicology, including the incorporation of gene expression data to determine the molecular pathways involved in the response, is becoming more common. In a companion paper, a genomic biomarker was developed in human TK6 cells to classify chemicals as genotoxic or non-genotoxic. Because TK6 cells are not metabolically competent, we set out to broaden the utility of the biomarker for use with chemicals requiring metabolic activation. Specifically, chemical exposures were conducted in the presence of rat liver S9. The ability of the biomarker to classify genotoxic (benzo[a]pyrene, BaP; aflatoxin B1, AFB1) and non-genotoxic (dexamethasone, DEX; phenobarbital, PB) agents correctly was evaluated. Cells were exposed to increasing chemical concentrations for 4h and collected 0h, 4h and 20h post-exposure. Relative survival, apoptosis, and micronucleus frequency were measured at 24h. Transcriptome profiles were measured with Agilent microarrays. Statistical modeling and bioinformatics tools were applied to classify each chemical using the genomic biomarker. BaP and AFB1 were correctly classified as genotoxic at the mid- and high concentrations at all three time points, whereas DEX was correctly classified as non-genotoxic at all concentrations and time points. The high concentration of PB was misclassified at 24h, suggesting that cytotoxicity at later time points may cause misclassification. The data suggest that the use of S9 does not impair the ability of the biomarker to classify genotoxicity in TK6 cells. Finally, we demonstrate that the biomarker is also able to accurately classify genotoxicity using a publicly available dataset derived from human HepaRG cells. This experiment examined the whole genome transcriptional response of TK6 cells exposed to BaP for 4 hours followed by a 4h in fresh media (8h time point) at 3 different concentrations, including a low (0.45 mg/ml), a medium (1.4 mg/ml), and a high (10 mg/ml) concentration, in addition to negative controls (+-S9), vehicle controls (+-S9) and a direct-acting positive control, cisplatin (-S9) at 24 mg/ml (PC-24). Each concentration and time point had 3 biological replicates. There were a total 12 samples (24 arrays) included in the final analysis using a two-colour dye swap design.Please note that each sample data table contains normalized data combined from two replicates and the sample-dye assignment information for each of the raw data files is included in the 'readme.txt' (available as Series supplementary file).",

MicroRNAs (miRs) function primarily as post-transcriptional negative regulators of gene expression through binding to their mRNA targets. Reliable prediction of a miR's targets is a considerable bioinformatic challenge of great importance for inferring the miR's function. Sequence-based prediction algorithms have high false-positive rates, are not in agreement, and are not biological context specific. Here we introduce CoSMic (Context-Specific MicroRNA analysis), an algorithm that combines sequence-based prediction with miR and mRNA expression data. CoSMic differs from existing methods--it identifies miRs that play active roles in the specific biological system of interest and predicts with less false positives their functional targets. We applied CoSMic to search for miRs that regulate the migratory response of human mammary cells to epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Several such miRs, whose putative targets were significantly enriched by migration processes were identified. We tested three of these miRs experimentally, and showed that they indeed affected the migratory phenotype; we also tested three negative controls. In comparison to other algorithms CoSMic indeed filters out false positives and allows improved identification of context-specific targets. CoSMic can greatly facilitate miR research in general and, in particular, advance our understanding of individual miRs' function in a specific context.

Although macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) have been proposed to drive the psoriatic cascade, their largely overlapping phenotype hampered studying their respective role. Topical application of Imiquimod, a Toll-like receptor 7 agonist, induces psoriasis in patients and psoriasiform inflammation in mice. We showed that daily application of Imiquimod for 14 days recapitulated both the initiation and the maintenance phase of psoriasis. Based on our ability to discriminate Langerhans cells (LCs), conventional DCs, monocytes, monocyte-derived DCs and macrophages in the skin, we characterized their dynamics during both phases of psoriasis. During the initiation phase, neutrophils infiltrated the epidermis whereas monocytes and monocyte-derived DCs were predominant in the dermis. During the maintenance phase, LCs and macrophage numbers increased in the epidermis and dermis, respectively. LC expansion resulted from local proliferation, a conclusion supported by transcriptional analysis. Continuous depletion of LCs during the course of Imiquimod treatment aggravated chronic psoriatic symptoms as documented by an increased influx of neutrophils and a stronger inflammation. Therefore, by developing a mouse model that mimics the human disease more accurately, we established that LCs play a negative regulatory role during the maintenance phase of psoriasis. DCs and other myeloid cell types were isolated from lymphoid organs as previously described (Henri et al. 2010). Briefly, LNs were cut into small pieces and digested for 20 min at room temperature with a mixture of type II collagenase (Worthington Biochemical) and DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich). The resulting cell suspension was treated with 5 mM EDTA to disrupt DC-T cell conjugates. After eliminating undigested material, light-density cells were enriched by centrifugation on an Optiprep solution (d = 1.32 g/mL, Abcys). To extract skin mononuclear phagocytic cells, ears were splitted into dorsal and ventral parts and incubated with a solution of PBS containing 1 mg/mL dispase (Roche) for 2 h at 37deg C or overnight at 4deg C, as specified.

BRD4 is a member of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family, which has become a promising drug target for numerous cancers. It has been reported that BRD4 is deregulated in gliomas; however, the precise molecular pathways regulated by BRD4 are still elusive.In this study, we knocked down BRD4 expression in glioma cell line U251 by lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) approach. BRD4 downregulation attenuated cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis. Genome-wide analysis of BRD4-regulated transcripts in U251 cells was performed using microarray to reveal the possible molecular mechanism. To knock down BRD4 expression in U251 cells, lentivirus that expressed shRNA against human BRD4 were transfected U251 cells. Scrambled shRNA (Scr-shRNA) that targeted a non-specific sequence was used as the normal control. The efficiency of BRD4 knockdown were demonstrated by real-time PCR and western blot assays. BRD4-shRNA- transfected and Scr-shRNA-transfected U251 cells were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.",

Purpose: We aimed to investigate in depth the regulation of microRNA expression by hypoxia in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7, establish the relationship between microRNA expression and HIF binding sites, pri-miRNA transcription and microRNA processing gene expression.Methods: microRNA sequencing data and gene expression microarray data were generated from MCF-7 cells submitted to an hypoxia timecourse (16h, 32h and 48h at 1% Oxygen). Data was integrated to 500 published high-stringency HIF binding sites identified in MCF-7 cells.Results: We identified 41 microRNAs significantly up- and 28 down- regulated, of which 38 mature and 20 star forms are reported in conjunction with hypoxia for the first time. HIF-1a and HIF-2a binding sites within 50kb distance of microRNA loci were found by integration of HIF ChIP-seq data, showing overall association between binding sites and up-regulation. Gene expression profiling analysis showed no full coordination between pri-miRNA and microRNA expression, pointing towards additional levels of regulation. Several transcripts playing a role in microRNA processing were found regulated by hypoxia, of which two were HIF dependent.Conclusions: The data support the hypothesis that microRNA expression under hypoxia is regulated at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. HIF is involved at both levels, regulating the transcription of certain microRNAs and also the expression of key elements of the microRNA processing pathway. microRNA-seq profiles of MCF-7 exposed to hypoxia (1% Oxygen) for 16h (2 replicates), 32h (2 replicates) and 48h (2 replicates) and to normoxia (2 replicates) were generated using Illumina sequencing platform.",

    "text": "Transcriptional Profiling Defines the Roles of ERK and p38 Kinases in Epidermal Keratinocytes. Epidermal keratinocytes respond to extracellular influences by activating cytoplasmic signal transduction pathways that change the transcriptional profiles of affected cells. To define responses to two such pathways, p38 and ERK, we used SB203580 and PD98059 as specific inhibitors, and identified the regulated genes after 1, 4, 24 and 48 hrs, using Affymetrix' Hu133Av2 microarrays. Additionally, we compared genes specifically regulated by p38 and ERKs with those regulated by JNK and by all three pathways simultaneously. We find that the p38 pathway induces the expression of extracellular matrix and proliferation-associated genes, while suppressing microtubule-associated genes; the ERK pathway induces the expression of nuclear envelope and mRNA splicing proteins, while suppressing steroid synthesis and mitochondrial energy production enzymes. Both pathways promote epidermal differentiation and induce feedback inactivation of MAPK signaling. c-FOS, SRY and N-Myc appear to be the principal targets of the p38 pathway, Elk-1 SAP1 and HLH2 of ERK, while FREAC-4, ARNT and USF are common to both.

From a large-scale comparative analysis of temporal transcriptomes from patient-matched tumor biopsies, we discovered highly recurrent differential expression and signature outputs of c-MET, LEF1 and YAP1 as drivers of acquired MAPK inhibitor resistance. Moreover, integration of gene- and signature-based transcriptomic analysis revealed profound CD8 T cell deficiency detected in half of resistant melanomas in association with downregulation of dendritic cells and antigen presentation.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent and deadly primary malignant brain tumor. Hallmarks are extensive intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity and highly invasive growth, which provide great challenges for treatment. Efficient therapy is lacking for GBM and the majority of patients survive less than one year from diagnosis. GBM progression and recurrence is caused by treatment-resistant glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). GSC cultures are considered important models to use in target identification and drug screening. The current state of the art method to isolate and maintain GSC cultures that faithfully mimic the primary tumor, is to use serum-free (SF) media conditions developed for neural stem cells (NSCs). Here we have investigated the outcome of explanting 230 consecutively collected GBM patient samples under both SF and standard, serum-containing media conditions. The establishment of maintainable SF cultures (SFCs) was most frequent, but for a subgroup of GBM specimens a viable culture could only be established in serum-containing media, called exclusive serum culture (ESC). ESCs expressed nestin and SOX2, and displayed all functional characteristics of GSCs, i.e. extended proliferation, sustained self-renewal and orthotopic tumor initiation. Once adapted to the in vitro milieu they were also sustainable in SF media. Molecular analyses showed that ESCs formed a discrete group that was most related to the mesenchymal GBM subtype. This distinct subgroup of GBM that had evaded modeling under SF conditions provide unique cell models of GBM intertumor heterogeneity.

DEK overexpression has proposed to be closely associated with many malignancies, however, functional mechanisms and crucial roles are still unclear. DEK-expressing cells significantly increased in human oral squamous cell carcinogenesis. We generated ubiquitous and squamous cell-specific Doxycycline (DOX)- inducible Dek mice (iDek and iDek-e mice, respectively). DOX administrated (DOX+) iDek mice promoted field cancerization and the development of OSCC in the environment exposed to carcinogen. By the microarray expression profiling analysis, the promotion of the filed cancerization by Dek overexpression was mediated by the upregulation of DNA replication- and cell cycle (G1 to S phase transition)-related genes.

Expression profiling of androgen and insulin pathway regulating genes unveils SOS 1 as candidate gene for idiopathic hirsutismBackground: Idiopathic Hirsutism (IH), defined as the presence of terminal hairs in females in a male-like pattern, affecting about 5% -15% of women, may result from the interaction between the androgen level and the sensitivity of the hair follicle to the androgen. The pathophysiology of IH is presumed to be linked to increased SRD5A activity, probably both isoenzyme types (SRD5A1 and SRD5A2) and generally related to an alteration in androgen receptor (AR) function. IH is often associated to metabolic syndrome, visceral obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and hypertension.Methodology/Principal Findings: With the aim of identifying genes involved in the pathogenesis of this disorder, we investigated the expression profile of 190 genes involved in the androgen biosynthesis and metabolism, and other genes coding for products active in the insulin pathway in skin genital fibroblasts. For this purpose we selected from a cohort of 240 women affected with androgen excess syndrome a group of 52 idiopathic hirsute patients (22%) and we selected 8 of them with the higher grade of hirsutism (Ferriman & Gallway score >20) for the genetic studies comparing the data with 4 healthy women used as controls. The array gene signature in the IH patients identified 4 differentially expressed genes, 2 up-regulated and 2 down-regulated (FC>=+- 1.5). Differentially expressed genes included products involved in insulin signalling while no androgens related genes were found altered in expression levels. We found that one of the over expressed transcript codes for the SOS1 gene product, which is overproduced in IH patients compared to controls. We did not identified any genomic variants or SNPs in the SOS1 promoter region and/or witin the 3'UTR with documented functional effects on SOS1 gene expression, although some variants in the 3'UTR seems to be potentially active in modulating the binding of transcription factors.Conclusions/Significance: In the cohort of women with androgen excess syndrome studied the 22% had neither hyperandrogenemia nor biochemical sign of hyperinsulinemia. We were able to demonstrate that SOS1 mRNA is over-expressed resulting in over production of SOS1 protein in IH patients. This suggests that an increase of SOS1 protein production could reflect a situation with an increased SOS1 activity function in hirsute patients. These findings propose a role for SOS1, in cooperation with other insulin pathway genes, in the pathogenesis of IH. We used the microarray technology to study the expression profiles of 190 genes involved in the androgen biosynthesis and metabolism, and other genes coding for products active in the insulin pathway, in genital skin fibroblasts of 8 idiopathic hirsute women and 4 related controls. To reduce individual variation and other confounding events, such as spontaneous up- and down-regulation of genes, the patients and the controls were pooled into 2 distinct pools. The gene expression analysis have been just used to identify genes which expression profiles result alterated and which could represents new genes involved in the pathogenesis of hirsutism.",

The species Staphylococcus (S.) aureus harbors 19 superantigen gene loci, six of which are located in the enterotoxin gene cluster (egc). While these egc superantigens are far more prevalent in clinical S. aureus isolates than non-egc superantigens, they are not a prominent cause of toxic shock. Moreover, neutralizing antibodies against egc superantigens are very rare, even among carriers of egc-positive S. aureus strains. In search of an explanation we have tested two non-exclusive hypotheses: 1) egc and non-egc superantigens have unique intrinsic properties and drive the immune system into different directions; 2) egc and non-egc-superantigens are released by S. aureus under different conditions, which shape the immune response.A comparison of three egc (SEI, SElM and SElO) and three non-egc superantigens (SEB, SElQ, TSST-1) revealed that both induced proliferation of human PBMC with comparable potency and elicited similar Th1/Th2-cytokine signatures. This was supported by gene expression analysis of PBMC stimulated with one representative superantigen from each group (SEI and SEB). They induced very similar transcriptional changes, especially of inflammation-associated gene networks, corresponding to a very strong Th1- and Th17-dominated immune response.In contrast, the regulation of superantigen release differed markedly between both superantigen groups. Egc-encoded proteins were secreted by S. aureus during exponential growth, while non-egc superantigens were released in the stationary phase.We conclude that the distinct biological behavior of egc and non-egc superantigens is not due to their intrinsic properties, which are very similar, but caused by their differential release by S. aureus. PBMCs from 3 healthy blood donors were purified and treated with Medium (control) and recombinant staphylococcal superantigens SEB and SEI.

Using conditional ablation, we show that loss of either, or both, Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b, progressively impedes hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation during serial in vivo passage. Concomitantly, HSC self-renewal is immensely augmented in absence of either Dnmt3, particularly Dnmt3a. Dnmt3-KO HSCs show upregulation of HSC multipotency genes and downregulation of early differentiation factors, and the differentiated progeny of Dnmt3-KO HSCs exhibit hypomethylation and incomplete repression of HSC-specific genes. HSCs lacking Dnmt3a manifest hyper-methylation of CpG islands and hypo-methylation of genes which are highly correlated with human hematologic malignancies. These data establish that aberrant DNA methylation has direct pathologic consequences for somatic stem cell development, leading to inefficient differentiation and maintenance of a self-renewal program. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (MspI,~40-220bp size fraction) of secondarily-transplanted wild-type and Dnmt3a conditional knockout hematopoietic stem cells.

Here we FACS-purified epithelial cells from human PDAC and normal pancreas and derived their genome-wide transcriptome and DNA methylome landscapes. Clustering based on DNA methylation revealed two distinct PDAC groups displaying different methylation patterns at regions encoding repeat elements. Methylationlow tumors are characterized by higher expression of endogenous retroviral (ERV) transcripts and dsRNA sensors which leads to a cell intrinsic activation of an interferon signature (IFNsign). This results in a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment and poor patient outcome. Methylationlow/IFNsignhigh and Methylationhigh/IFNsignlow PDAC cells preserve lineage traits, respective of normal ductal or acinar pancreatic cells. Moreover, ductal-derived KrasG12D/Trp53-/- mouse PDACs show higher expression of IFNsign compared to acinar-derived counterparts. Collectively, our data point to two different origins and etiologies of human PDACs, with the aggressive Methylationlow/IFNsignhigh subtype potentially targetable by agents blocking intrinsic IFN-signaling.

Background: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been implicated in metastasis, drug resistance, survival under stress and also conferring stem cell-like traits to cancer cells. However, several of the studies have been carried out using model systems that don't appropriately recapitulate all stages of the dynamic process of EMT. Hence, there is a need to overcome this limitation by development of a model system that allows us to mimic each stage of EMT and accurately assess the plastic changes associated with it. Methods: We have derived a cancer cell line from the PyMT-MMTV model of breast cancer, named PyMT-1099 cells, and undertaken a detailed characterization of the morpho-genetic changes it undergoes during a TGF-induced EMT. Further, we have also performed high throughput transcriptomics on PyMT-1099 cells undergoing EMT in a high resolution kinetic of TGF treatment. Results: We show that PyMT-1099 cells undergo an EMT comparable to the classically used immortalized NMuMG cells as assessed by morphological, and marker expression changes on TGFtreatment. Further, PyMT-1099 cells can also migrate in vitro in response to TGF treatment. These cells are also tumorigenic and lead to metastasis formation when transplanted into immunocompromised mice. Conclusion: In this study we report the development of PyMT-1099 cells as an excellent tool to model and study breast cancer-associated EMT both in vitro and in vivo and show that these cells overcome the limitations posed by other cellular systems currently being used to study EMT.

EPS can occur years after termination of PD and, in severe cases, leads to intestinal obstruction and ileus requiring surgical intervention. Despite ongoing research, the pathogenesis of EPS remains unclear. We performed a global transcriptome analysis of peritoneal tissue specimens from EPS patients, PD patients without EPS, and uremic patients without history of PD or EPS (Uremic). Unsupervised and supervised bioinformatics analysis revealed distinct transcriptional patterns that discriminated these three clinical groups. The analysis identified a signature of 219 genes expressed differentially in EPS as compared to PD and Uremic groups. Canonical pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes showed enrichment in several pathways, including antigen presentation, dendritic cell maturation, B cell development, chemokine signaling and humoral and cellular immunity (P value <0.05). Further interactive network analysis depicted effects of EPS-associated genes on networks linked to inflammation, immunological response, and cell proliferation. Gene expression changes were confirmed by qRT-PCR for a subset of the differentially expressed genes. EPS patient tissues exhibited elevated expression of genes encoding sulfatase1, thrombospondin 1, fibronectin 1 and alpha smooth muscle actin, among many others, while in EPS and PD tissues mRNAs encoding leptin and retinol-binding protein 4 were markedly down-regulated, compared to Uremic group patients. Immunolocalization of Collagen 1 alpha 1 revealed that Col1a1 protein was predominantly expressed in the submesothelial compact zone of EPS patient peritoneal samples, whereas PD patient peritoneal samples exhibited homogenous Col1a1 staining throughout the tissue samples. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis is a distinct pathological process from the simple peritoneal fibrosis that accompanies all PD treatment.

    "text": "The role of lncRNA Sarrah in human cardiomyocytes. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to (patho)physiological processes in the heart. Aging is the major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and cardiomyocyte apoptosis is an underlying cause for age-related cardiac dysfunction. RNA sequencing of cardiomyocytes from young and aged mouse hearts revealed several aging-regulated lncRNAs. An siRNA screen for caspase activity identified the aging-regulated lncRNA Sarrah (ENSMUST00000140003) as anti-apoptotic, which we confirmed in human cells (human SARRAH is annotated as OXCT1-AS1). Importantly, human engineered heart tissue showed impaired contractile force development upon SARRAH knockdown compared with controls. Computational prediction of RNA-DNA triple helix formation showed that SARRAH may directly bind the promoters of genes downregulated after SARRAH silencing, which mainly consist of cell survival genes. Indeed, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed RNA-DNA triple helix formation and cardiomyocytes lacking the triple helix-forming domain of Sarrah showed an increase in apoptosis. One of the key direct SARRAH targets is NRF2, an anti-oxidant transcription factor. Restoration of NRF2 levels after SARRAH silencing partially rescues the reduction in cell viability. RNA affinity purification mass spectrometry analysis identified CRIP2 as main protein interaction partner. Furthermore, SARRAH associates with acetyltransferase p300 and acetylated histone H3K27. Finally, Sarrah was also profoundly downregulated after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in mice. Adeno-associated virus-mediated overexpression of Sarrah in mice showed better recovery of cardiac contractile function after AMI compared to control mice, as measured by echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging, consistent with a decrease in cardiomyocyte cell death and an increase in endothelial cell proliferation. In summary, we identified the anti-apoptotic evolutionary conserved lncRNA Sarrah, which is downregulated by aging, as a pivotal regulator of cardiomyocyte survival. Sarrah overexpression has beneficial effects on AMI recovery highlighting it as a potential therapeutic approach against heart failure. 3 replicates human cardiomyocytes were transfected with control gapmeRs and, in parallel, 3 replicates human cardiomyocytes were transfected with gapmeRs targeting lncRNA Sarrah.",

Hippo-YAP signaling pathway is a highly conserved pathway during evolution. It involves in a broad spectrum of physiological and pathological procedure. It also functions in early lineage differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, but the detailed mechanisms remain elusive. Our previous research revealed that knockout of Mst1 and Mst2, the key components of Hippo signaling in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), led ESCs preferentially differentiate into ectoderm lineage, and the differentiation to mesoderm and endoderm lineage was disturbed. To uncover the underlying regulatory mechanisms, we performed ChIP-seq experiments with antibodies against Yap, master transcription factors and some characterized histone modification markers. Combined with RNA-seq assays of wild type and Mst KO ESCs and day 4 embryoid bodies (EBs), we found that YAP is preferentially enriched at Nanog, Sox2, Oct4 and H3K27Ac co-marked super-enhancers (SEs) in ESCs. The upregulation of YAP in Mst KO ESCs resulted in the formation of new super-enhancers on lineage associated genes, leading to the upregulation of these genes and the distortion of ESC differentiation. Hence, our study revealed a super-enhancer related ESC lineage differentiation mechanism which can be shaped by Hippo-YAP signaling. Examination of ES and EB in 2 cell types.",

Background: Basal cells within the human airway epithelium constitute the stem/progenitor cells for other epithelial cell types. Basal cells respond to mucosal injury and damage to the airway mucosa in an ordered sequence of spreading, migration, proliferation and phenotype shifting (differentiation) to other needed cell types. However, dynamic gene transcription in the early events of injury and repair has not been examined in these cells. Methodology and findings: Airway epithelial cells were obtained from donated lungs and grown in submersion culture on pliable membranes to obtain a pure population of basal cells. Microarrays were used to assess the transcriptome of basal cells 8 and 24 hr after mechanical injury (MI), or to cyclic stretch (CS) in a Flexcell system (0.5 Hz, 20% distension), or both treatments. We identified 121 signature genes with > 2-fold higher differential expression (DE) 8 hr after MI; expression of nearly all of these genes returned to baseline at 24 hr after injury. In cells subjected to CS, little change in DE was noted at 8 hr, whereas at 24 hr a CS signature of 1430 DE genes were identified. The MI signature was characterized by genes encoding growth factor receptors related to the EGF pathway, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-33, extracellular matrix components, and NF-kB and p38-MAPK signaling pathways, whereas the CS signature was characterized by a broad range of genes that did not identify specific signaling pathways. Combined MI and CS at 8 hr elicited DE of down-regulated genes not seen with either stimulus alone, and at 24 hr elicited DE that was similar to that seen with CS alone. Conclusion and significance: The human airway basal epithelial cell transcription signature in the first hours after MI, after CS, and after both stimuli identifies unique differentially expressed genes and pathways that may be important in the early molecular response and biology to airway injury. Total RNA obtained from primary (AEC) and differentiated (dAEC) human airway epithelial cells subjected to 8 or 24 hours in vitro mechanical or cyclic stretch or both injuries compared to sham control as well as to type of injury.

Overexpression of RALYL, or RALY and hnRNP C1 that are two other members of the hnRNP C-family, induced HPV16 late gene expression from HPV16 subgenomic plasmids and from episomal forms of the full-length HPV16 genome. Induction of HPV16 late gene expression by the hnRNP C-proteins was dependent on the HPV16 early untranslated region to which these proteins also were shown to bind in vitro, and in living cells. Our experiments revealed that hnRNP C proteins that interacted with the HPV16 early untranslated region reached out to the splicing silencer complex at HPV16 SD3632 and derepressed this splice site, thereby activating production of HPV16 spliced late L1 mRNAs.

In a forward genetic screen we identified a Chlamydia trachomatis L2/434/Bu mutant that causes rapid apoptotic and necrotic death of infected host cells. This phenotype could be linked to the loss of the inclusion membrane protein CpoS. We observed a reduction in cell death when infections were carried out in the presence of cycloheximide or actinomycin D, suggesting that the engagement of cell death depends on host transcription and protein synthesis. We applied RNA-Seq to study the transcriptional response of human endocervical epithelial (A2EN) cells to infection with wild-type or CpoS-deficient bacteria. At 6 hpi the transcriptional profiles of cells infected with the two strains were similar to each other and to the transcriptome of uninfected cells. However, by 18 hpi the transcriptional profile of cells infected with the mutant was strongly altered, with 400 host genes being upregulated greater than two-fold. Among those differentially expressed genes, we observed an enrichment of immunity-related genes, including in particular cytokine genes and interferon-stimulated genes. Overall these data demonstrate that the CpoS-deficient mutant induces an exacerbated interferon response. mRNA profiles of uninfected human A2EN cells, A2EN cells infected with wild-type C. trachomatis L2/434/Bu, and A2EN cells infected with CpoS-deficient C. trachomatis L2/434/Bu were analyzed at 6 hpi and at 18 hpi.

Steroid hormones are well-recognized suppressors of the inflammatory response, however, their cell- and tissue-specific effects in the regulation of inflammation are far less understood, particularly for the sex-related steroids. To determine the contribution of progesterone in the endothelium, we have characterized and validated an in vitro culture system in which human umbilical vein endothelial cells constitutively express human progesterone receptor (PR). Using next generation RNA-sequencing, we identified a selective group of cytokines that are suppressed by progesterone both under physiological conditions and during pathological activation by lipopolysaccharide. In particular, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL2/3, and CXCL1 were found to be direct targets of PR, as determined by ChIP-sequencing. Regulation of these cytokines by progesterone was also confirmed by bead-based multiplex cytokine assays and quantitative PCR. These findings provide a novel role for PR in the direct regulation of cytokine levels secreted by the endothelium. They also suggest that progesterone-PR signaling in the endothelium directly impacts leukocyte trafficking in PR-expressing tissues.

The specific role of ERRa in tumor growth and progression, however, is yet to be fully understood. The significant homology between estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) and ERRa initially suggested that these receptors may share similar transcriptional targets. Using the well-characterized ERa-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, we sought to gain a genome-wide picture of ERa-ERRa cross-talk using an unbiased microarray approach.Since a small molecule ligand has not been identified for ERRa, its transcriptional activity in these studies was induced using its known coactivator PGC-1a (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g coactivator-1a) as a protein ligand. Both wild-type PGC1, as well as ERRa-specific variant (PGC1 2x9) were used to activate ERRa.

Muscle atrophy contributes to the poor prognosis of many physiopathological conditions, but pharmacological therapies are still limited. Muscle activity leads to major swings in mitochondrial [Ca2+] which control aerobic metabolism, cell death and survival pathways. We have investigated in vivo the effects of mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis in skeletal muscle function and trophism, by overexpressing or silencing the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU). The results coherently demonstrate that both in developing and in adult muscles MCU-dependent mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake has a marked trophic effect that does not depend on autophagy or aerobic control, but impinges on two major hypertrophic pathways of skeletal muscle, PGC-1a4 and Igf1-Akt/PKB. In adult mice, MCU overexpression protects from denervation-induced atrophy. These data reveal a novel Ca2+-dependent organelle-to-nucleus signaling route, which links mitochondrial function to the control of muscle mass and may represent a possible pharmacological target in sarcopenia. Experiments were performed on biological replicates of single skeletal muscle fibres. Seven fibres were chosen for their Mutochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU) overexpression and other seven fibres because MCU was silenced.

We have investigated whether gene expression patterns in circulating leukocytes are associated with presence and extent of CAD.MethodsPatients undergoing coronary angiography were selected according to their Duke CAD index (CADi), a validated angiographical measure of the extent of coronary atherosclerosis that correlates with outcome. RNA was extracted from 110 patients with CAD (CADi>23) and from 112 partially matched controls without CAD (CADi=0). Gene expression was assessed using Affymetrix U133A chips. Genes correlating with CAD were identified using Spearman's rank correlation, and predictive gene expression patterns were identified using a partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis.Results160 individual genes were found to significantly correlate with CADi (rho>0.2, P<0.0027), although changes in individual gene expression were relatively small (1.2 to 1.5 fold). Using these 160 genes, the PLS multivariate regression resulted in a highly predictive model (r2=0.764, P<0.001). Cross-validation showed that most of the predictive model was carried by only 8 genes (r2=0.752) (table 1).ConclusionSimultaneous expression pattern of 8 genes appears to be highly predictive for CAD.

Low glucose induces the expression of ubiquitous genes involved in stress responses, nutrient sensing, and organelle biogenesis. By contrast, stimulatory glucose concentrations activate genes with a more restricted expression pattern (b- and neuronal- cell identity). Consistently, glucose-induced genes are globally reduced in islets deficient with Hnf1a (MODY3), characterized by a deficient glucose metabolism. Of interest, a cell cycle gene module was the most enriched among the variable genes between intermediate and stimulatory glucose concentrations.

Communication between glioblastoma brain tumor (GBM) and its microenvironment alters the parameters of tumor growth and host responses, and may be mediated in part by tumor-secreted RNA. The global repertoire of extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) released by GBM, however, has not been investigated. We have developed a protocol enabling quantitative, minimally biased analysis of vesicular and non-vesicular exRNA complexes, including microvesicles (MVs) and exosomes (collectively called extracelluar vesicles; EVs), as well as ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) and applied it to study exRNA in patient-derived glioma stem-like cultures (GSC). Despite the intertumoral heterogeneity, further exacerbated at the exRNA level, the extracellular complexes exhibit distinct RNA composition, with microvesicles most closely reflecting the cellular transcriptome, and exRNPs exhibiting the most discrete repertoire. Up to 90% of exRNA reads represent fragmented rRNA; the remaining content is enriched in small ncRNA species, such as miRNAs in exosomes, and precisely processed tRNA and Y RNA fragments in both EVs and exRNPs. EV-enclosed mRNAs are mostly fragmented, and UTRs are more abundant than ORF regions; nevertheless, some full-length transcripts are present. Overall, there is less than one copy of non-rRNA per EV. Our results suggest that massive EV/exRNA uptake would be required to ensure functional impact of transferred information to the normal recipient cells of the brain and predict the most impactful miRNAs in such conditions.

NLRP6 was previously demonstrated to regulate the production of IL-18 and is important for protecting mice against chemically-induced intestinal injury and colitis-associated colon cancer. However, the cellular mechanisms by which NLRP6 reduces susceptibility to colonic inflammation remain unclear. Here, we determined that NLRP6 expression is specifically upregulated in Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes that infiltrate into the colon during dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced inflammation. Adoptive transfer of WT Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes into Nlrp6-/- mice was sufficient to protect them from mortality, significantly reducing intestinal permeability and damage. NLRP6-deficient inflammatory monocytes were specifically defective in TNFa production, which was important for reducing DSS-induced mortality and dependent on autocrine IL-18 signaling by inflammatory monocytes. Our data reveal a previously unappreciated role for NLRP6 in inflammatory monocytes, which are recruited during intestinal injury to promote barrier function and limit bacteria-driven inflammation.

During inflammation, neutrophils are rapidly mobilized from the bone marrow storage pool into peripheral blood to subsequently enter lesional sites where most of them rapidly undergo apoptosis. Monocytes constitute a second wave of inflammatory immigrates giving rise to long-lived macrophages and dendritic cell subsets. According to descriptive immunophenotypic and cell culture studies, neutrophils may directly \"transdifferentiate\" into monocytes/macrophages. We here provide mechanistic data in human supporting the existence of this cellular pathway. Global transcriptional profiling of neutrophil-dervived monocytic cells revealed close resemblance of gene expression with monocytes and a clear separation of these cells from neutrophils. G-CSF mobilized neutrophils from peripheral blood were isolated and in vitro stimulated with GM-CSF, TNFa, and Il-1b for 5 days to generate monocytic cells.

The fidelity of sound transmission by cochlear implants in patients with sensorineural hearing loss could be greatly improved by increasing the number of frequency channels. This could be achieved by stimulating and guiding neurite outgrowth to reduce the distance between the implant's electrodes and the remnants of the spiral ganglion neurons. However, little is known about signaling pathways, besides those of neurotrophic factors, that are operational in the adult spiral ganglion. To systematically identify neuronal receptors for guidance cues in the adult cochlea, we conducted a genome-wide cDNA microarray screen with two-month-old CBA/CaJ mice. A meta-analysis of our data and those from older mice in two other studies revealed the presence of neuronal transmembrane receptors that represent all four established guidance pathways--ephrin, netrin, semaphorin, and slit--in the mature cochlea as late as 15 months. In addition, we observed the expression of all known receptors for the Wnt morphogens, whose neuronal guidance function has only recently been recognized. In situ hybridizations located the mRNAs of the Wnt receptors frizzled 1, 4, 6, 9, and 10 specifically in adult spiral ganglion neurons. Finally, frizzled 9 protein was found in the growth cones of adult spiral ganglion neurons that were regenerating neurites in culture. We conclude from our results that adult spiral ganglion neurons are poised to respond to neurite damage, owing to the constitutive expression of a large and diverse collection of guidance receptors. Wnt signaling, in particular, emerges as a candidate pathway for guiding neurite outgrowth towards a cochlear implant after sensorineural hearing loss. To determine which potential guidance receptors were present in the adult cochlea and whether any of them were chronically up- or downregulated after damage, we conducted a microarray hybridization screen with modioli from three unexposed and noise-exposed mice each. The noise treatment was administered at four weeks of age, and the modioli were harvested at eight weeks of age. The pre-processed hybridization signals (GSM321743-8) were further analyzed with Bioconductor tools (release 2.1; www.bioconductor.org) in R software (version 2.6.1; http://www.r-project.org) according to the procedures outlined in Gentleman et al.

The acute and chronic toxicity of e-cig use is unclear generally in the context of increasing reports of inflammatory-type pneumonia in some e-cig users. To assess lung effects of e-cigs without nicotine or flavors, we conducted a pilot study with serial bronchoscopies over 4 weeks in 30 never-smokers, randomized either to a four-week intervention with the use of e-cigs containing only 50% propylene glycol (PG) and 50% vegetable glycerine (VG) or to a no-use control group. Compliance to the e-cig intervention was assessed by participants sending daily puff counts and by urinary propylene glycol (PG). Inflammatory cell counts and cytokines were determined in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids. Genome-wide expression, microRNA, and mRNA were determined from bronchial epithelial cells. There were no significant differences in changes of BAL inflammatory cell counts or cytokines between baseline and follow-up, comparing the control and e-cig groups. However, in the intervention but not the control group, change in urinary PG as a marker of e-cig use and inhalation, was significantly correlated with change in cell counts (cell concentrations, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and cytokines (IL-8, IL-13, and TNF-a), although the absolute magnitude of changes was small.

Recent reports of directed reprogramming have raised questions about the stability of cell lineages. Here, we have addressed this issue, focusing upon skin-derived precursors (SKPs), a dermally-derived precursor cell. We show by lineage tracing that murine SKPs from dorsal skin originate from mesenchymal and not neural crest-derived cells. These mesenchymally-derived SKPs can, without genetic manipulation, generate functional Schwann cells, a neural crest cell type, and are highly similar at the transcriptional level to Schwann cells isolated from the peripheral nerve. This is not a mouse-specific phenomenon, since human SKPs that are highly similar at the transcriptome level can be made from facial (neural crest-derived) and foreskin (mesodermally-derived) dermis, and the mesodermally-derived SKPs can make myelinating Schwann cells. Thus, non-neural crest-derived mesenchymal precursors can differentiate into bona fide peripheral glia in the absence of genetic manipulation, suggesting that developmentally-defined lineage boundaries are more flexible than widely thought. We obtained 4 independent samples of neonatal human foreskin and 4 independent samples of discarded facial skin tissue from children less than two years old. Primary cells were isolated and cultured as SKPs and RNA was collected from those cultured samples. RNA samples deriving from these cells were analyzed on the Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array.",

Hidden Markov Model based next generation sequence analysis identified ~68,000 methylated regions per sample. While global CpG Island (CGI) methylation was not differential between benign adjacent and cancer samples, overall promoter CGI methylation increased from ~12.6% in benign samples to 19.3% and 21.8% in localized and metastatic cancer tissues, respectively. We found distinct patterns of promoter methylation around transcription start sites, where methylation occurred not only on the CGIs, but also on flanking regions and CGI sparse promoters. Among the 6,691 methylated promoters in prostate tissues, 2481 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are cancer specific, including numerous novel DMRs. A novel cancer specific DMR in WFDC2 promoter showed heavy methylation in cancer (17/22 tissues, 6/6 cell lines), but not in the benign tissues (0/10) and normal PrEC cells. Integration of LNCaP DNA methylation and H3K4me3 data suggested an epigenetic mechanism for alternate transcription start site utilization and these modifications segregated into distinct regions when present on the same promoter.

The analysis revealed the expression of many well-documented retinal genes as well as a high number of non-annotated genes. Quantitative realtime PCR analysis verified the microarray results in the majority of studied genes. A statistical analysis of the 4 microarray slides revealed 603 differentially expressed genes which were grouped into 6 expression clusters. A bioinformatic analysis of these clusters revealed sets of genes encoding proteins with functions that are likely to be relevant to inner retinal function (e.g. potassium, sodium, calcium, and chloride channels, synaptic vesicle transport, and axonogenesis). In addition, we performed a histological analysis of the maturing retina and studied different aspects of retinal structure. The analysis revealed a significant reduction of outer nuclear layer thickness between 11 and 19 weeks of age and a significant reduction of retinal ganglion cell number at 11 and 19 weeks comparing to 5 weeks.

Here we investigated by gene expression (GEP) profiling whether AML-M0 cases should be considered as one or more unique molecular subgroups that discriminates them from other AML patients. By applying GEP and subsequent unsupervised analysis of 35 AML-M0 samples and 253 previously reported AML cases, we demonstrate that AML-M0 cases express a unique signature. Hematological transcription regulators such as CEBPA, CEBPD, PU.1 and ETV6 and the differentiation associated gene MPO appeared strongly down-regulated, in line with the very primitive state of this type of leukemia. Moreover, AML M0 cases appeared to have a strong positive correlation with a previously defined immature AML subgroup with adverse prognosis. AML-M0 leukemias frequently carry loss-of-function RUNX-1 mutation and unsupervised analyses revealed a striking distinction between cases with and without mutations. RUNX1 mutant AML-M0 samples showed a distinct up-regulation of B-cell-related genes, e.g. members of the B-cell receptor complex, transcriptions regulators RUNX3, ETS2, IRF8 or PRDM1 and major histocompatibility complex class II genes. Importantly, expression of one single gene, i.e. BLNK, enabled prediction of RUNX1 mutations in AML-M0 with high accuracy.

Glioblastomas (GBM) are brain tumors which display a bad prognosis despite conventional treatment associating surgical resection and subsequent radio-chemotherapy. These tumors are defined by an abundant and abnormal vascularization as well as by an important cellular heterogeneity. GBM notably contain a subpopulation of GBM stem-like cells (GSC) which contribute to tumor aggressiveness, resistance, and recurrence. Moreover, GSC directly take part in the formation of new vessels via their transdifferentiation into tumor derived endothelial cells (TDEC). Considering the importance of the vascularization in the GBM, we postulate that radiation could enhance the transdifferentiation of GSC into TDEC. Here, we show that ionizing radiation potentiates endothelial features of TDEC obtained from 3 patient-derived primocultures of GSC. Indeed, TDEC obtained from irradiated GSC (TDEC IR+) migrate more towards VEGF, form more pseudotubes in Matrigel in vitro and develop more functional blood vessel in Matrigel plugs implanted in Nude mice than TDEC obtained from non-irradiated GSC. Transcriptomic analysis allows us to highlight an overexpression of Tie2 in TDEC IR+ which is associated with the activation of AKT signaling pathway. All radiation-induced effects on TDEC IR+ were abolished by using a Tie2 kinase inhibitor, confirming the role of Tie2 signaling pathway in this process. Finally, the number of Tie2+ vessels is increased in recurrent GBM compared with matched untreated tumors. In conclusion, we show that irradiation potentiates proangiogenic features of TDEC throught Tie2/AKT signaling pathway. New therapeutic stategies associating standard teatment and an inhibitor of Tie2 signaling pathway should be considered for forthcoming trials. 12 samples were analyzed: 3 replicates of 4 different condition: GBM stem cells (GSC) (line SRC3), GBM differentiated cells (GDC) obtained from SRC3 GSC and Tumor Derived endothelial cells (TDEC) obtained from irradiated or not SRC3 GSC.",

Background: Ewing sarcoma, a highly aggressive tumor of children and young adults, is characterized most commonly by an 11;22 chromosomal translocation that fuses EWSR1 located at 22q12 with FLI1, coding for a member of the ETS family of transcription factors. Although genetic changes in Ewing sarcoma have been extensively researched, our understanding of the role of epigenetic modifications in this neoplasm is limited. Procedure: In an effort to improve our knowledge in the role of epigenetic changes in Ewing sarcoma we evaluated the in vitro antineoplastic effect of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-Aza-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) and identified epigenetically silenced genes by pharmacologic unmasking of DNA methylation coupled with genome-wide expression profiling.",

Purpose: The complement system is closely linked to the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Several complement genes are expressed in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and complement proteins accumulate in drusen. Further, a common variant of complement factor H (CFH) confers increased risk of developing AMD. Because the mechanisms by which changes in the function of CFH influence development of AMD are unclear, we examined ocular complement expression as a consequence of age in control and CFH null mutant mice.Methods: Gene expression in neuroretinas and RPE/choroid from young and aged WT and Cfh-/- C57BL/6J mice was analysed by microarrays. Expression of a wide range of complement genes was compared to expression in splenocytes and in liver tissue by qRT-PCR.Results: An age-associated increased expression of complement, particularly C1q, C3 and Factor B, in the RPE/choroid coincided with increased expression of the negative regulators Cfh and Cd59a in the neuroretina. Young mice deficient in CFH expressed Cd59a similar to WT, but failed to upregulate Cd59a expression with age. Both hepatic and splenic expression of Cd59a increased with age regardless of Cfh genotype.Conclusions: While the connection between CFH deficiency and failure to up-regulate CD59a remains unknown, these results suggest that expression of CD59 is tissue-specific and that neuroretinal regulation depends on CFH. This could contribute to the visual functional deficits and morphological changes in the Cfh-/- mouse retina that occur with age, and further suggests that deficient neuroretinal regulation of complement could represent an early event in AMD.

Lymphoid committed CD34+lin-CD10+CD24- progenitors undergo a rebound at month 3 after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in the absence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Here, we analyzed transcriptional programs of cell-sorted circulating lymphoid committed progenitors and CD34+Lin-CD10- non lymphoid progenitors in 11 allo-HSCT patients having (n=5) or not developed (n=6) grade 2 or 3 aGVHD and in 7 age-matched healthy donors.

Notably, genes from protein biogenesis, translation machinery and cell cycle (CDK6) were over-expressed in progenitors from patients in the absence of aGVHD compared with healthy donors and patients affected by aGVHD. Expression of many genes from the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation metabolic pathway leading to ATP production were more specifically increased in lymphoid committed progenitors in absence of aGVHD. This was also the case for genes involved in cell mobilization such as those regulating Rho GTPases activity. In all, we show that circulating lymphoid committed progenitors undergo profound changes in metabolism favoring cell proliferation, energy production and cell mobilization after allo-HSCT in humans.

Inhibition of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) has shown efficacy in reducing body weight and improving metabolic parameters, with the effects correlating with target engagement in the brain. Recently, the peripheral effects of inhibiting the CB1 receptor has been appreciated through studies in diet-induced obese and liver-specific CB1 KO mice. In this report, we systematically investigated gene expression changes in peripheral tissues of DIO mice treated with the CB1 inverse agonist AM251. CB1 receptor inhibition led to down-regulation of genes within the de novo fatty acid and cholesterol synthetic pathways, including SREBP-1 and -2, and their downstream targets in both liver and adipose tissue. In addition, genes involved in fatty acid Beta-oxidation were up-regulated with AM251 treatment, probably through the activation of PPARalpha. In adipose tissue, CB1 receptor inhibition led to the down-regulation of genes in the TNFalpha signal transduction pathway and possibly to the activation of PPARgamma, both of which would result in improved insulin sensitivity. CB1-/- mice were obtained from A. Zimmer (University of Bonn) (Zimmer et al., 1999) and back-crossed onto C57BL/6J genetic background for ten generations by A. Zimmer before homozygous CB1-/- mice were re-derived at Taconic Farms (German Town, NY) onto the C57BL/6N genetic background. Male CB1-/- mice and control littermates (n=5-7 in each group) at 2 months of age were fed with regular chow (Teklad 7012, 13 % kcal from fat, 3.41 kcal/g, Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN, USA) or high fat diet (S3282, 59.4% kcal from fat; 24.5% kcal from carbohydrate; 16.2% kcal from protein; 5.29 kcal/g, Bio-Serv, Frenchtown, NJ, USA) for 14 weeks, and were individually caged 1 week before drug treatment.

Solid cancers develop within a supportive microenvironment that promotes tumor formation and continued growth through the elaboration of mitogens and chemokines. Within these tumors, monocytes (macrophages and microglia) represent rich sources of these stromal factors. Leveraging a genetically-engineered mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) low-grade brain tumor (optic glioma), previous studies have demonstrated that microglia are important for glioma formation and maintenance. To identify the tumor-associated microglial factors that support glioma growth (gliomagens), we employed a comprehensive large scale discovery effort using optimized advanced RNA-sequencing methods. Candidate gliomagens were prioritized to identify potential secreted or membrane-bound proteins, which were next validated by quantitative RT-PCR and RNA FISH following minocycline-mediated microglial inactivation in vivo. Using these selection criteria, Ccl5 was identified as a highly expressed chemokine in both genetically engineered Nf1 mouse and human optic gliomas. As a candidate gliomagen, recombinant Ccl5 increased Nf1-deficient optic nerve astrocyte growth in vitro. Importantly, consistent with its critical role in maintaining tumor growth, Ccl5 inhibition with neutralizing antibodies reduced Nf1 mouse optic glioma growth in vivo. Collectively, these findings establish Ccl5 as critical stromal growth factor in low-grade glioma maintenance relevant to future microglia-targeted therapies for brain tumors. Nf1 optic glioma associated microglia from mice were flow sorted. Upregulated genes of glioma associated microglia were verified and further examined.",

Susceptibility genes for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), monogenetic disorders with intellectual disabilities (ID) or schizophrenia (SCZ) converge on processes related to neuronal function and differentiation. Furthermore, ASD risk genes are enriched for FMRP (Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein) targets and for genes implicated in ID. In addition, a significant co-heritability was observed between ASD and SCZ. The genetic overlap between ASD, FXS, ID and SCZ together with the symptomatic differences gives rise to the question if pathomechanisms impair the same or different regulatory patterns activated during neuronal differentiation (ND). To test this idea, we performed transcriptome analysis of in-vitro differentiation of the neuroblastoma cell line model SH-SY5Y and identified genes that were differentially expressed, dynamically regulated, and coordinately expressed. The identified genetic modules activated during ND are enriched for genetic risk factors for these four disorders. Although risk genes for the disorders significantly overlap, we observed disorder specific enrichments: ASD or FXS implicated genes were likely to be positive regulators of ND whereas ID implicated genes were related to negative regulation. ASD and SCZ genes were specifically enriched among cholesterol and fatty acid associated modules. ID genes were overrepresented among cell cycle modules. In addition, we show that ASD genes are likely to be hub genes. We hypothesize that knowledge about genetic variants of an individual combined with network and pathway context of the related genes will allow differentiating between psychiatric disorders. 21 samples, consisting of 3 replicates harvested at 7 different time-points of RA+BDNF-induced neuronal differentiation.",

BackgroundIdentification of patients at risk of tuberculosis relapse following treatment would revolutionize clinical trials of new drugs and regimens and facilitate clinical management. The study aim was to determine whether tuberculosis patients who subsequently suffer relapse have different immune responses to mycobacteria in vitro compared to patients who remain cured for two years post-treatment.MethodsFirst episode pulmonary tuberculosis patients were recruited into a surrogate marker study in Cape Town, South Africa. Peripheral blood samples were collected at diagnosis and after two and four weeks of tuberculosis treatment. Diluted blood was cultured with live Mycobacterium tuberculosis for six days and cellular RNA was frozen. Gene expression in samples from ten patients who subsequently relapsed, confirmed by stain genotyping, was compared to those who remained cured using Affymetrix microarrays.ResultsAt diagnosis, the expression of 668 genes was significantly different in samples from patients who subsequently relapsed compared to successfully cured patients, and these differences persisted for at least four weeks. Gene Ontology and biological pathways analyses revealed the most significant difference was up-regulation of genes involved in cytotoxic cell-mediated killing, such as perforin, granulysin and fas ligand. Results were confirmed by qRT-PCR in a wider patient cohort.ConclusionsThese data show that patients who will subsequently relapse exhibit altered immune responses at diagnosis, including excessively robust cytolytic responses to M. tuberculosis in vitro, compared to patients who will achieve durable cure. Together with microbiological and clinical indices, these differences could be exploited for patient stratification in drugs trials, or for host-directed therapy development.

By cross-referencing the differences in gene expression between these groups, we identified 35 genes potentially regulated by PTHrP in the mammary mesenchyme, including 6 genes known to be involved in BMP signaling.

Using mammary bud cultures, we demonstrated that MMP2 acts downstream of PTHrP to stimulate ductal outgrowth.

    "text": "Differences in food intake of tumour-bearing cachectic mice are associated with hypothalamic serotonin signalling [A286_GEO_LLM]. Background: Anorexia is a common symptom among cancer patients and contributes to malnutrition and strongly impinges on quality of life. Cancer-induced anorexia is thought to be caused by an inability of food intake-regulating systems in the hypothalamus to respond adequately to negative energy balance during tumour growth. Here, we show that this impaired response of food-intake control is likely to be mediated by altered serotonin signalling and by failure in post-transcriptional neuropeptide Y (NPY) regulation. Methods: Two tumour cachectic mouse models with different food intake behaviours were used: a C26-colon adenocarcinoma model with increased food intake and a Lewis lung carcinoma model with decreased food intake. This contrast in food intake behaviour between tumour-bearing (TB) mice in response to growth of the two different tumours was used to distinguish between processes involved in cachexia and mechanisms that might be important in food intake regulation. The hypothalamus was used for transcriptomics (affymetrix chips). Results: In both models, hypothalamic expression of orexigenic NPY was significantly higher compared with controls, suggesting that this change does not directly reflect food intake status but might be linked to negative energy balance in cachexia. Expression of genes involved in serotonin signalling showed to be different between C26-TB mice and Lewis lung carcinoma-TB mice and was inversely associated with food intake. In vitro, using hypothalamic cell lines, serotonin repressed neuronal hypothalamic NPY secretion while not affecting messenger NPY expression, suggesting that serotonin signalling can interfere with NPY synthesis, transport, or secretion.Conclusions: Altered serotonin signalling is associated with changes in food intake behaviour in cachectic TB mice. Serotonins' inhibitory effect on food intake under cancer cachectic conditions is probably via affecting the NPY system. Therefore, serotonin regulation might be a therapeutic target to prevent the development of cancer-induced eating disorders. Lewis Lung tumour cells were intramuscularly inoculated 6w old male C57BL/6 mice. Body weight and food intake were measured 3 times a week. On day 10, 14 and 17 hypothalamus was dissected and used for gene expression profiling.",

Objective - The TRIB1 locus has been linked to hepatic triglyceride metabolism in mice and to plasma triglycerides and coronary artery disease (CAD) in humans. The lipid associated SNPs identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are located ~ 30 kb downstream from TRIB1 suggesting complex regulatory effects on genes or pathways relevant to hepatic triglyceride metabolism. The goal of this study was to investigate the functional relationship between common SNPs at the TRIB1 locus and plasma lipid traits.Methods & Results - Characterization of the risk locus reveals that it encompasses a gene, TRIB1 associated locus (TRIBAL) comprised of a well conserved promoter region and an alternatively spliced transcript. Bioinformatic analysis and re-sequencing identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2001844, within the promoter region that associates with increased plasma triglycerides, reduced HDL-C and CAD risk. Furthermore, we show that rs2001844 is an expression trait locus (eQTL) for TRIB1 expression in blood and alters TRIBAL promoter activity in a reporter assay model. The TRIBAL transcript has features typical of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA), including poor sequence conservation. Modulation of TRIBAL expression had limited impact on either TRIB1 or lipid regulatory genes mRNA levels in human hepatocyte models. In contrast, TRIB1 knockdown markedly increased TRIBAL expression in HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes.Conclusions - These studies demonstrate an interplay between a novel locus,TRIBAL, and TRIB1. TRIBAL is located in the GWAS identified risk locus, responds to altered expression of TRIB1, harbors a risk SNP that is an eQTL for TRIB1 expression and associates with plasma triglyceride concentrations.

Inflammation plays a role in neuropathic pain conditions as well as in pain induced solely by an inflammatory stimulus. Robust mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia can be induced by locally inflaming the L5 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in rat. This model allows investigation of the contribution of inflammation per se to chronic pain conditions. Most previous microarray studies of DRG gene expression have investigated neuropathic pain models involving axon transection. To examine the role of inflammation, we used microarray methods to examine gene expression 3 days after local inflammation of the L5 DRG in rat.We observed significant regulation in a large number of genes (23% of observed transcripts), and examined 221 (3%) with a fold-change of 1.5-fold or more in more detail. Immune-related genes were the largest category in this group and included members of the complement system as well as several pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, these upregulated cytokines had no prior links to peripheral pain in the literature other than through microarray studies, though most had previously described roles in CNS (especially neuroinflammatory conditions) as well as in immune responses. The L5 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) was locally inflamed with zymosan/Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant. DRG were isolated 3 days later. Each sample was RNA extracted from a single DRG. 6 samples from rats with local DRG inflammation were compared with 6 samples from sham-operated rats.",

PHF8 (PHD Finger 8) mutations have been found in patients with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) and craniofacial deformities. Here we identify PHF8 as the first enzyme that mediates demethylation of mono-methylated histone H4 lysine (K) 20 (H4K20me1), with additional activities towards H3K9me2/1 and H3K27me2. Patient mutations significantly compromise the demethylase activity, indicating functional importance. ChIP-seq identified PHF8 near the transcription start sites (TSS) of over 7000 target genes as well as in gene bodies and intergenic regions. PHF8 depletion resulted in up-regulation of H4K20me1 and H3K9me1 at the TSS-associated sites, and H3K9me2 in the gene bodies and intergenic regions, respectively, demonstrating differential substrate specificities at different target genomic locations. PHF8 depletion at the TSS results in decreased target gene expression, which is coincident with increased occupancy of the protein L3MBTL1 previously shown to induce chromatin compaction via binding to lower methyl states including H4K20me1 and H3K9me1.

To directly identify endogenous miRNA binding sites, we performed photo-crosslinking immunoprecipitation using antibodies against Ago2, followed by deep-sequencing of RNA tags (CLIP-seq) in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We also performed parallel CLIP-seq in Dicer null mESCs that lack mature miRNAs, allowing us to define whether the association of Ago2 with the identified sites was mediated by miRNAs. We include the exon-array expression data obtained from three sets of Dicer WT and Dicer Null mESCs.These data are used to determine genes that are differentially expressed between Dicer WT and Dicer Null conditions.

UHRF1 is a major regulator of epigenetic mechanism and is overexpressed in various human malignancies. In this study, we examined the involvement of UHRF1 in aberrant DNA methylation in colorectal cancer (CRC). In CRC cells, transient UHRF1 knockdown rapidly induced DNA demethylation across entire genomic regions, including CpG islands, gene bodies and repetitive elements. Nonetheless, UHRF1 depletion only minimally reversed CpG island hypermethylation-associated gene silencing. However, the combination of UHRF1 depletion and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition synergistically reactivated the silenced genes and strongly suppressed CRC cell proliferation. Our results suggest that (i) maintenance of DNA methylation in CRC cells is highly dependent on UHRF1; (ii) UHRF1 depletion rapidly induces DNA demethylation, though it is insufficient to fully reactivate the silenced genes; and (iii) dual targeting of UHRF1 and HDAC may be an effective new therapeutic strategy. RKO cells were transfected with a control siRNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or siRNAs targeting UHRF1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated for 72 h.

Epigenetic silencing of HLTF in human b cells alters insulin secretion and is associated with diabetes. Here we examine the effects of Hltf-deletion on b cell function in genetically engineered mouse models. The developmental timeline for the exclusive expression of full-length Hltf mRNA and protein overlaps with the organization of murine pancreatic islets. Reduced insulin in the pancreatic b cells of global Hltf-deleted near-term (E18.5) fetal mice predicts postpartum hypoinsulinemia. Seventy-five percent of newborn global Hltf-deleted postprandial mice die at a ratio of 3:2 males to females with negligible serum insulin levels, and their apoptotic b cells are devoid of insulin. They are also hypoglycemic. Newborn b cell-specific Hltf-deleted mice succumb to the same loss of glucose homeostasis indicating the phenotype is solely attributable to loss of b cell function. Confirmation that an intact immune system is an absolute requirement for the phenotype resulted from breeding the Hltf-deletion into the Rag2-IL2-null background. Triple null (Hltf-/-Rag2-/-IL2-/-) newborn mice that lack functional receptors for IL-2,-4,-7,-9,-15, and -21, and have severe lymphocyte developmental impairment (deficient T and B cells, no NK cells) are euglycemic and normoinsulinemic with normal survival rates. Transcriptomic profiling (RNA-seq) eliminated b cell-specific Hltf-deletion on gene programs essential for normal development, and b cell secretion. Significantly, Hltf-deletion induced IL33/b cell signaling that promoted islet infiltration of fetal CD8+T cells and b cell apoptosis. Our data suggest, Hltf-deleted newborns that are not profoundly hypoglycemic survive in the absence of memory CD8+T cells. These Hltf-deletion studies provide mechanistic insights to how Hltf-deletion in b cells promotes their immune destruction. We previously used RNA-seq in conjunction with 3SEQ/transcriptome to quantify expression levels in brain (14), heart (15), and placenta (7). RNase levels in pancreas are 181,000-fold higher than brain (https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/ambion-tech-support/nuclease-enzymes/tech-notes/rnase-activity-in-mouse-tissue.html). As a result, isolation of total RNA was highly variable. Total RNA (n=47 samples) was isolated, its integrity and purity were assessed (Agilent Bioanalyzer). Ultimately pancreata (n=6 samples; 3 test (Hltf rIPCre fl/fl with low (<15 mg/dL) blood sugar, and 3 Hltf +/+ euglycemic controls) perfused in situ with RNAlater (21) using a 1 CC syringe and a 26g 1/2 needle, and snap frozen were suitable (Table 2) for rRNA-depletion. cDNA was generated from rRNA-depleted samples and subjected to Illumina library preparation. Libraries were sequenced utilizing Illumina sequencing technology. Paired-end 100 nucleotide reads were aligned to genomic assembly mm10 and analyzed using the platform provided by DNAnexus, Inc. (Mountain View, CA) to generate an unbiased gene expression analysis report of RNA-seq; alternative splicing analysis of Hltf; mutation/RNA-editing analysis and parallel comparison of expression profiles between b cell-specific Hltf-deleted pancreata and control pancreata. The power in detecting alternative splicing was dramatically increased by paired-end sequencing relative to single-end sequencing. FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads) were mapped against mm10 with Tophat (V1.3.3) to obtain .bam mapping files that were input into Cufflinks for transcript assembly. Cuffdiff (V 1.3.0), part of the Cufflinks package, used the alignment reads for rigorous statistical comparison of two conditions (b cell-specific Hltf-deleted and wild type control pancreata) and 3 biological replicates for each condition. The depth of sequencing was a minimum of 20 million sequencing reads per sample [90% Power, 5% significance level: 91+/- 4% of all annotated genes are sequenced at a frequency of 0.1 times/103 bases X 3 x 109 bases/sequencing read x 3 samples = 9 x104 reads/gene].

    "text": "Gene expression profiling reveals biological pathways responsible for phenotypic heterogeneity between UK and Sri Lankan OSCC. Background: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a major world health problem with over 400,000 new cases diagnosed annually. Despite advances in surgery and chemo-radiotherapy, the 5 year survival has remained roughly constant at approximately 50% for several decades. The disease is characterized by both clinical and genetic heterogeneity, so elucidating the molecular basis of this heterogeneity would have significant clinical implications. It is well recognized that OSCCs from Asia that are associated with betel quid chewing are phenotypically distinct from those from the West that are predominantly caused by smoking/drinking, but the genetic basis of these differences are largely unknown. The aim of this study is to examine the most related genetic factors, carcinogenic related pathways, and molecular processes that might be responsible for the phenotypic heterogeneity of OSCC between UK and Sri Lankan population groups. Methods: We have compared the gene expression profiles of OSCCs and normal oral mucosal tissues from both Sri Lankan and UK individuals using Affymetrix gene expression arrays.Results: The gene expression profiles of UK and Sri Lankan OSCC are similar in many respects to other oral cancer expression profiles reported in the literature and were mainly similar to each other. However, genes involved in tumor invasion, metastasis and recurrence were more obviously associated with UK tumors as opposed to those from Sri Lanka. Interestingly, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed a highly activated cell-mediated immune response in both Sri Lankan normal and tumor samples relative to UK cohorts, which may, in part, explain the less aggressive behavior of these betel quid-induced OSCCs. Conclusion: The development of OSCCs in both UK and Sri Lankan populations appears largely mediated by similar biological pathways despite the differences related to race, ethnicity, lifestyle, and/or exposure to environmental carcinogens. However, IPA revealed a highly activated \"Cell-mediated Immune Response\" in Sri Lankan normal and tumor samples relative to UK cohorts. It seems likely, therefore, that any future attempts to personalize treatment for OSCC patients will need to be different in Western and Asian countries to reflect differences in gene expression and the immune status of the patients. All biopsy specimens of OSCC and normal oral mucosa were harvested with appropriate ethical approval and informed consent of individual patients (LREC 0769). Identical protocols for tissue collection and processing were used in both countries. OSCC samples were obtained from sequential incident cases treated by a single consultant surgeon from 2001 to 2004 at University Hospital of Birmingham, NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK, and Kandy General Hospital, Kandy, Sri Lanka. A total of 21 UK and 27 Sri Lankan samples yielded RNA of sufficient quality and quantity for microarray analysis. In addition, 8 normal oral mucosa specimens (five samples from UK & three samples from Sri Lankan population) were also profiled. All normal samples were from non-smokers, who did not chew betel quid and did not consume in excess of the national recommended weekly gender allowance of alcohol.

TWIST1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor is essential for the development of cranial mesoderm and cranial neural crest-derived craniofacial structures. Our previous work showed that, in the absence of TWIST1, some cells within the cranial mesoderm adopt an abnormal epithelial configuration. Here, we show by transcriptome analysis that loss of TWIST1 in the cranial mesoderm is accompanied by a reduction in the expression of genes that are associated with cell-extracellular matrix interactions and the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics. By comparing the transcriptional profiles of cranial mesoderm-specific Twist1 loss-of-function mutant and control mouse embryos, we identified a set of genes that are both TWIST1-dependent and predominantly expressed in the mesoderm. By ChIP-seq in a cell line model of a TWIST1-dependent mesenchymal state, we identified, among the downstream genes, three direct transcriptional targets of TWIST1: Ddr2, Pcolce and Tgfbi. Our findings show that the mesenchymal properties of the cranial mesoderm is likely to be regulated by a network of TWIST1 targets genes that influence the extracellular matrix and cell-matrix interactions, and collectively they are required for the morphogenesis of the craniofacial structures.

In many mouse models of skin cancer, only a few tumors typically form although many cells competent for tumorigenesis receive the same oncogenic mutations. These observations suggest a selection process for defining tumor initiating cells. Here we use quantitative mRNA- and miR-Seq to determine the impact of HRasG12V on the transcriptome of keratinocytes. We discover that microRNA-203 is downregulated by HRasG12V. Using a knockout mouse model, we demonstrate that loss of microRNA-203 promotes selection and expansion of tumor-initiating cells. Conversely, restoration of microRNA-203 with an inducible model potently inhibits proliferation of these cells. We comprehensively identify microRNA-203 targets required for HRas-initiated tumorigenesis. These targets include important effectors of the Ras pathway and essential genes required for cell division.

The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors Olig1 and Olig2 promote myelination, whereas bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and Wnt/b-catenin signaling inhibit myelination. Here we show that these opposing regulators of myelination are functionally linked by the Olig1/2 common target Smad-interacting protein-1 (Sip1). We demonstrate that Sip1 is an essential modulator of CNS myelination. Sip1 represses differentiation inhibitory signals by antagonizing BMP receptor-activated Smad activity while activating crucial oligodendrocyte-promoting factors. Importantly, a key Sip1-activated target, Smad7, is required for oligodendrocyte differentiation and partially rescues differentiation defects caused by Sip1 loss. Smad7 promotes myelination by blocking the BMP- and b-catenin-negative regulatory pathways. Thus, our findings reveal that Sip1-mediated antagonism of inhibitory signaling is critical for promoting CNS myelination and point to new mediators for myelin repair.

To identify the epigenetic changes involved in GD, we performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation and enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone marks in sorted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We found 365 and 3322 differentially methylated CpG sites in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively.

Despite significant effort and recent advances, the mechanism by which the p300 transcriptional coactivator mediates tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here, we use a genetic and chemical approach to identify the Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) as a critical downstream target of p300 driving human melanoma growth. We find that direct transcriptional control of MITF by p300-dependent histone acetylation within proximal gene regulatory regions is coupled to cellular proliferation, suggesting a significant growth regulatory axis. Further analysis revealed Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) as a key effector of the p300-MITF axis driving cell growth, which is selectively activated in human melanomas. Targeted chemical inhibition of p300 histone acetyltransferase activity using a potent and selective catalytic p300/CBP inhibitor confirmed the critical role of the p300-MITF-FOXM1 axis in melanoma and demonstrated significant growth inhibitory effects in melanoma cells expressing high levels of MITF. These data support p300 as a promising novel epigenetic therapeutic target in human melanoma.

Musashi1 (Msi1) is a highly conserved RNA binding protein that is required during the development of the nervous system. Msi1 has a role in neural stem cells, controlling the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Msi1 has also been implicated in cancer, being highly expressed in multiple tumor types. In this study, we analyzed Msi1 expression in a large cohort of medulloblastoma samples and showed that Msi1 is highly expressed in tumor tissue compared to normal cerebellum and that high Msi1 expression is associated with a poor prognosis. Using a nude mouse xenograft model, we demonstrate that Msi1 is important for tumor growth. We then used RIP-chip (ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation followed by microarray analysis) to identify mRNA targets of Msi1 in medulloblastoma. In conclusion, our results suggest that Msi1 functions as a regulator of multiple processes in medulloblastoma formation and could become an important therapeutic target. RIP-Chip analysis to identify mRNA preferentially associated with Msi1 protein.RIP-Chip experiments were performed on two biologically replicated samples.

Liver fibrosis following chronic HCV infection plays a pivotal role in loss of liver function and end stage liver disease. However the dynamics and molecular events that lead to fibrosis in HCV infection are poorly defined. Therefore, we determined the influence of HCV infection in altering the miRNA expression levels which can modulate immune responses to HCV leading to fibrosis. Analysis of the miRNA expression profiles of HCV infected liver biopsies revealed that 45 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the HCV infected liver when compared to normal livers. In silico target prediction of these differentially expressed miRNAs indicated that their targets include chemokine/cytokine signaling, cell cycle genes and extracellular matrix protein gene expression. Gene expression profiling using whole genome microarray demonstrated that 1320 genes were differentially expressed in chronic HCV liver when compared to normal. These genes could be functionally grouped into those involved in cell cycle regulation, cytokines and chemokines expression, cell adhesion, intracellular signaling and enzymes. Further pathway analysis using GeneGo software identified cell adhesion, cytoskeleton remodeling, cytokine signaling and metabolic pathways as the major pathways activated in chronic HCV. Combinatorial target prediction analysis of miRNA expression along with gene expression analysis indicated that differentially expressed microRNAs in HCV significantly impact transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b) signaling pathway, cell adhesion (integrin expression), chemokine signaling, Notch signaling and cell-cycle( Cyclin D,K) regulation. Overall these results demonstrate that chronic HCV infection induces specific miRNA signatures that will modulate genes involved in the cytoskeletal remodeling and cytokine signaling that can promote the development of fibrosis following HCV infection. Liver biopsies from chronic HCV patients and control liver biopsies from normal subjects (donor liver prior to transplantation) were used to analyze the miRNA and gene expression profile.

    "text": "Role of Apollon in human melanoma resistance to anti-tumor agents that activate the intrinsic or the extrinsic apoptosis pathways. PURPOSE: To assess the role of Apollon in melanoma resistance to intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis and to identify strategies to reduce its expression. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Expression of Apollon was assessed in melanoma cell lines and in surgical specimens.Gene expression profiling, mitochondrial depolarization, caspases activation and apoptosis assays were used to test the effect of Apollon silencing, by siRNA, on melanoma response to different anti-tumor agents. Levels of expression of Apollon and melanoma apoptosis were assessed after tumor treatment with the combination of MEK- and mTOR- inhibitors, or of anti-HLA class II mAbs and anti-tumor agents. RESULTS: Melanoma cells constitutively expressed Apollon, in-vitro and in-vivo. Extent of melanoma apoptosis correlated significantly with Apollon downmodulation upon treatment with a MEK inhibitor, a BRAFV600E-specific inhibitor or the nitrosourea fotemustine. Apollon silencing enhanced melanoma apoptosis in response to the cytotoxic drugs camptothecin, celecoxib, fotemustine and temozolomide, to MEK- and BRAFV600E-specific inhibitors, and to soluble or membrane-bound TRAIL. Mechanistically, Apollon silencing in melanoma cells promoted mitochondrial depolarization, caspase-2, -8, -9 and -3 activation and alteration in the expression of genes related to different cellular functions in response to different anti-tumor agents. Treatment of melanoma cells with combination of MEK and of mTOR inhibitors, or of HLA class II antigen-specific mAb and anti-tumor agents, promoted Apollon downmodulation, associated with enhanced apoptotic responses. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that Apollon is a relevant molecule in melanoma resistance to apoptosis, and that strategies aimed at downmodulating Apollon protein may improve melanoma cell death in response to anti-tumor agents that trigger the intrinsic or the extrinsic apoptosis pathways. The human melanoma cell line Me23682 was established in our laboratory from a surgical specimen. Cells were routinely maintained in RPMI medium 1640 (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza) and 2 mM glutamine (Lonza). Cells were maintained at 37degC in a water-saturated atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. 3x106 cells were seeded in 10 cm dishes; after 24 hours, cells were transfected with Apollon-specific siRNA or its unrelated control (Stealth RNAi siRNA, Invitrogen Life Technologies, Camarillo, CA) at a final concentration of 75 nmol/L and then left untreated or treated with fotemustine (Muphoran, Italfarmaco, Milan, Italy) at 150 umol/L for 6 hours, or with the BRAFV600E-specific inhibitor PLX4720 (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX) at 500 nmol/L for 8 hours, or with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI) at 5 nmol/L for 8 hours.

BRAF(V600E) mutant melanomas treated with inhibitors of the BRAF and MEK kinases almost invariably develop resistance, which is frequently caused by reactivation of the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway. To identify novel treatment options for such patients, we searched for acquired vulnerabilities of MAPK inhibitor-resistant melanomas. We find that resistance to BRAF+MEK inhibitors is associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Subsequent treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) vorinostat represses SLC7A11 that leads to a lethal increase in the already elevated levels of ROS in drug-resistant cells, thereby causing selective apoptotic death of only the drug resistant tumor cells. Consistently, treatment of BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma with HDACi in mice results in a dramatic tumor regression.

Photoreceptor degeneration is the central event leading to visual impairment or blindness in most retinal diseases. However, the discovery of safe and effective therapeutic strategies conferring photoreceptor protection remains challenging. A systems pharmacology approach, synergistically targeting distinct cellular pathways could provide an effective strategy for evaluating, preventing or treating retinal dystrophies. Here this concept was investigated using a mouse model of light-induced retinal degeneration. We show that a combination of FDA-approved drugs acting on different G protein-coupled receptors in a synergistic manner could protect retinas against light-induced degeneration when each drug in the combination treatment was administered at a sub-therapeutic dose. Furthermore, transcriptome analyses demonstrated that such combined treatments also preserved patterns of retinal gene expression more characteristic of the normal retina than did single therapies at higher doses. The current study thus supports a new systems pharmacology approach that may extend to other complex neurodegenerative disorders in addition to retinal diseases. Male and female Abca4-/-Rdh8-/- at the age of 4- to 6-weeks were used for the current study. All mice were housed and maintained in a 12 h light (<=10 lux)/12 h dark cyclic environment in the Animal Resource Center at the School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU).

Osteocytes, positioned within bone's interstitial space, are subject to fluid flow upon whole bone loading. Such fluid flow is widely theorized to be a mechanical signal transduced by osteocytes, initiating a poorly understood cascade of signaling events mediating bone metabolism. The objective of this study was to utilize high-throughput approaches to examine the time course of flow-induced changes in osteocyte gene transcript and protein levels.Microarray analysis demonstrated fluid flow regulation of genes consistent with known anabolic loading responses, including Ptgs2, NF-kB inhibitors, MAP3 kinases, and Wnt/b-catenin pathway signaling molecules. However, two of the most highly up-regulated gene products--Cxcl1 and Cxcl2, confirmed by qPCR--have not previously been reported to be responsive to fluid flow. Gene ontology analysis suggested a highly significant inflammatory and immune response, with cellular functions including trafficking, cell-to-cell signaling, and tissue development. Proteomic analysis of the same samples demonstrated greatest up-regulation of the ATP-producing enzyme NDK, calcium-binding Calcyclin, and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 6. An integrative pathway analysis merging fold changes in transcript and protein levels predicted signaling nodes not directly detected at the sampled time points, including STAT3 and c-Myc. These results extend our knowledge of the osteocytic response to fluid flow, most notably up-regulation of Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 as a possible paracrine agent for osteoblastic and osteoclastic recruitment.

For around ten years, microarrays have been suggested for the diagnosis of ionizing radiation exposure. We assessed for the first time the relevance of gene expression profiling in a real accidental case. This study was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 41 potential victims. The different strategies of analysis highlighted a huge effect of the blood sample handling on the gene expression profiles. This effect was so high that it could mask specific modulations as a potential effect of ionizing radiation exposure. Thus, we assessed a new way of blood sampling adapted to gene expression analysis: PAXgene. With this method, more than 70% of the modulations of gene expression induced 3 hours after an ex vivo exposure to 0.5 Gy were preserved even in a 24-hour delayed analysis (as for transportation of blood sample from the accident location to the laboratory). We validated a new methodology in order to propose a new strategy of blood sampling and handling for gene profiling. This system could be used in case of accidental overexposure to study whether gene expression is a relevant biomarker of ionizing radiation exposure. Radiation induced gene expression in human blood was measured at 3 hours after exposure to doses of 0 and 0.5 grays. Following the incubation of 3 hours at 37degC, the RNA extractions were performed either immediately or 24h later (as for transportation of blood sample at room temperature).

Background: Here, the role of a-ketoglutarate (aKG) in the epi-metabolic control of DNA demethylation has been investigated in therapeutically relevant cardiac mesenchymal cells (CMSCs) isolated from controls and type 2 diabetes donors. Methods & results: Quantitative global analysis, methylated and hydroxymethylated DNA sequencing and gene specific GC methylation detection revealed an accumulation of 5mC, 5hmC and 5fC in the genomic DNA of human CMSCs isolated from diabetic (D) donors (D-CMSCs). Whole heart genomic DNA analysis revealed iterative oxidative cytosine modification accumulation in mice exposed to high fat diet (HFD), injected with streptozotocin (STZ) or both in combination (STZ-HFD). In this context, untargeted and targeted metabolomics indicated an intracellular reduction of aKG synthesis in D-CMSCs and in the whole heart of HFD mice. This observation was paralleled by a compromised thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) and ten eleven translocation protein 1 (TET1) association and function with TET1 relocating out of the nucleus. Molecular dynamics and mutational analyses showed that aKG binds TDG on Arg275 providing an enzymatic allosteric activation. As a consequence, the enzyme significantly increased its capacity to remove G/T nucleotide mismatched or 5fC. Accordingly, an exogenous source of aKG restored the DNA demethylation cycle by promoting TDG function, TET1 nuclear localization and TET/TDG association. TDG inactivation by CRISPR/Cas9 knockout or TET/TDG siRNA knockdown induced 5fC accumulation thus partially mimicking the diabetic epigenetic landscape in cells of non- diabetic origin. The novel compound (S)-2-[(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)amino]succinic acid (AA6), identified as an inhibitor of aKG-dehydrogenase, increased the aKG level in D- CMSCs and in the heart of HFD mice eliciting DNA demethylation, glucose uptake and insulin response. Conclusions: In this report we established that diabetes may epigenetically modify and compromise function of therapeutically relevant cardiac mesenchymal cells. Restoring the epi-metabolic control of DNA demethylation cycle promises beneficial effects on cells compromised by environmental metabolic changes. Human primary cardiac mesenchymal cells (CMSC) from 7 diabetic (D) and 7 non-diabetic (ND) donors were analyzed after few rounds of ex vivo expansion. RNA was isolated and sequenced.",

However, the functional relevance of these mutations remains unknown. Here we show that the JARID1B histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase is frequently amplified and overexpressed in luminal breast tumors and a somatic point mutation of JARID1B leads to the gain of luminal-specific gene expression programs. Downregulation of JARID1B in luminal breast cancer cells induces the expression of basal cell-specific genes and growth arrest, which is partially rescued by the inhibition of TGFBR thereby indicating a key role for TGFb signaling. Integrated genome-wide analysis of JARID1B chromatin binding, histone H3 lysine trimethyl (H3K4me3) and dimethyl (H3K4me2) patterns, and gene expression profiles in luminal and basal-like breast cancer cells suggest a key role for JARID1B in luminal cell-specific gene expression programs. A significant fraction of JARID1B binding-sites overlaps with CTCF in both luminal and basal-like breast cancer cells. CTCF also co-immunoprecipitates with JARID1B and it may influence its histone demethylase (HDM) activity as the H3K4me3/me2 ratio is lower at the CTCF-overlapping compared to JARID1B-unique sites. Additionally, a heterozygous JARID1B missense mutation (K1435R) in the HCC2157 basal-like breast cancer cell line is associated with unique JARID1B chromatin-binding and gene expression patterns implying gain of luminal features. In line with this, exogenous expression of this mutant in basal-like breast cancer cells leads to a gain of JARID1B binding at many luminal-specific genes. A PARADIGM score reflecting JARID1B activity in luminal breast cancer cells is associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with luminal breast tumors. Together, our data imply that JARID1B is a luminal lineage-driving oncogene and that its therapeutic targeting may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in treatment-resistant luminal breast tumors.

We found that samples collected in RNAlater had higher and more consistent RINs compared to snap frozen tissue, with similar RINs obtained for tissue collected in RNAlater as large (1 cm3) and small (~0.1 cm3) tissue pieces. RNAlater appeared to better stabilize the time zero gene expression pattern compared to snap freezing for first trimester placenta. Microarray DNA methylation analysis showed that overall the DNA methylation profiles remained quite stable over a two hour time period after removal of the placenta from the uterus, with the DNAgard condition being superior to both snap freezing and RNAlater. The collection of placental samples in RNAlater and DNAgard is simple, and eliminates the need for liquid nitrogen or a freezer on-site. Moreover, the quality of the nucleic acids and the resulting data from samples collected in these preservation solutions is actually higher than that from samples collected using the traditional snap-freeze method. Thus, this new approach to placental sample collection is both easier to implement in busy clinical environments and yields higher quality data.72 samples. In this study, our objective was to identify the optimal timing and mode of collection for nucleic acids of sufficient quality to perform genome-wide RNA gene expression and DNA methylation studies for downstream molecular and functional enrichment analysis. To do this, we evaluated three different placenta collection methods: snap freezing in liquid nitrogen, RNAlaterTM, and DNAgard, over a two-hour window upon removal from the uterus, to determine: 1) the optimal collection method(s) for evaluation of mRNA expression and DNA methylation; and 2) the time period after delivery during which such optimal samples should be collected.",

Gene expression profiles of peripheral blood samples from C57BL/6 mice exposed with ionizing radiation.We used mice as model animal to study biologial recovery response after radiation damage. Therefore, we obtained gene expression profiles from C57BL/6 mice exposed with various levels of ionizing radiation, including low and high doses and control groups. In order to measure recovery rate, we collected peripheral blood samples at different time durations after the exposure. In order to obtain robust signatures specific to radiation response, we are interested in knowing if the radiation signarures will be present in the presence of confounders. Therefore, mice were given intraperitoneal injections of lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (LPS), or treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), otherwise no treatment after ionizing radiation exposure. The underlying mechanism of confounder treatment is that LPS induces strong immune response resembling the effect of infection, and GCSF stimulates mobilization of HSCs. Exploratory analysis shows that the confounding effects did affect the radiation signature to some extent. This study provides insights into the molecular basis of time- and dose- dependent response to ionizing radiation in mice hematopoietic system. A total of 536 C57BL/6 mice peripheral blood gene expression profiles were measured in 3 different batches using the Affymetrix mouse 430A 2.0 microarray.

    "text": "Loss of Oncogenic Notch1 Contributes to PI3 Kinase Inhibitor Resistance in T Lineage Leukemia. Somatic NOTCH1 mutations are found in ~60% of T lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs). Notch1 is cleaved by g secretase to generate activated Notch intracellular domain (NICD) proteins. The NOTCH1 mutations found in T-ALL constitutively activate Notch1 signaling by increasing NICD levels. Genetic alterations in components of the Ras/PI3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway are also highly prevalent in T-ALL, and often coexist with NOTCH1 mutations. Exposing a T-ALL cell line to the PI3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor GDC-0941 generated drug resistant clones that down-regulated NICD expression. To address the in vivo relevance of this unexpected observation, we transplanted primary wild-type (WT) and KrasG12D mutant T-ALLs into recipient mice, and treated them with GDC-0941 alone and in combination with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (PD901). Although many leukemias responded dramatically to these targeted agents in vivo, drug-resistant clones invariably emerged. Multiple resistant T-ALLs lost NICD expression through mechanisms that included loss of Notch1 mutations found in the parental T-ALL. These GDC-0941-resistant leukemias exhibited reduced expression of many Notch1 target genes, elevated levels of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt), and displayed cross-resistance to g secretase inhibitors (GSIs). Consistent with these data, inhibiting Notch1 activity in T-ALL cells enhanced PI3K signaling, providing a likely mechanism for in vivo selection against clones with Notch1 pathway activation. Thus, oncogenic Notch1 mutations that promote clonal outgrowth during malignant transformation unexpectedly \"switch\" to become deleterious during treatment with a PI3K inhibitor. These data advance our understanding of T-ALL pathogenesis and have implications for implementing new therapeutic regimens. We analyzed 28 mouse T-ALL samples obtained after in vivo treatment with GDC-0941 alone or GDC-0941 + PD0325901. These T-ALL samples are either Kras wild type or harbor a KrasG12D mutations.",

Background: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and most lethal primary malignant brain tumor, correlated with survival rates of less than one year from the time of diagnosis. Current surgical procedure attempts to remove the bulk of the tumor mass, whereas GBM frequently recurs within 1-3cm from the primary tumor resection site. Molecular mechanisms involved in the recurrence of the tumor are still poorly understood. The aim of the study was to define the molecular signature of GBM surrounding white matter (WM) in order to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved with tumor relapse. Material & Methods: Human GBM tumor bulk and surrounding tissue (1-3cm from the border of the tumor) were obtained from five patients who underwent total tumour resection, while normal white matter was harvested from patients who underwent surgical procedure for nonmalignant pathologies. Samples were processed for hybridization on the Affymetrix Human U133A arrays and data were examined with the GeneSpring analysis software. Results: Gene expression analysis of the samples was done in 2 independent steps. First, molecular profiling comparison of GBM surrounding WM and normal WM resulted in 59 genes differentially expressed between both tissues. Among these, numerous genes expressed by mature neural cells were down-regulated in GBM surrounding WM, while gene products supporting invasion were overexpressed. Moreover, KLRC1, a specific natural killer receptor naturally involved in the activation of antitumoral cells was drastically repressed in GBM surrounding WM, suggesting that the antitumoral immune surveillance is compromised in this tissue. Second, we focused our study on genes specifically regulated in GBM periphery respectively to GBM core. The highest up-regulated gene in GBM surrounding tissue encodes for DTX4, a regulator of NOTCH signalling pathway described for its key role in maintaining neural progenitors in an uncommitted state.Conclusion: This study revealed unique molecular characteristics of GBM surrounding tissue, showing the dysregulation of genes involved in immune surveillance along with genes associated to stemness maintenance. All together, these data may help to understand the molecular mechanisms associated with GBM recurrence. This study attempted to define the molecular characteristics of the GBM surrounding tissue. To this end, GBM tumor samples were obtained from 5 patients who underwent total tumor resection. Surrounding tumor mass tissue was retrieved in all cases from not infiltrated white matter sited at 2 cm from the macroscopic tumor border. Furthermore, control white matter biopsies were harvested from patients operated on for deep intracerebral cavernomas. Each sample was hybridized onto Affymetrix human U133 arrays. For each patient, tumor core sample and surrounding tissue were harvested and are identified with the same suffix number. In 2 cases, (patients 3 and 4), two tumor peripheral tissue samples were harvested and are identified with the same number followed by \"R\" (replicate).",

    "text": "Individual Stress Vulnerability Is Predicted by Short-Term Memory and AMPA Receptor Subunit Ratio in the Hippocampus. Chronic stress is a key risk factor for a variety of diseases, but the determinants of individual stress susceptibility are still unclear. Using a recently developed paradigm for chronic social stress in mice we identified animals that were resistant or susceptible to the persistent effects of chronic stress exposure. Gene expression analysis in laser-microdissected hippocampal subfields of both groups revealed differentially regulated AMPA receptor subunits, which might affect the susceptibility of an individual to chronic social stress. To test this hypothesis, animals were treated with the AMPA receptor potentiator LY451646 or vehicle during the last 4 weeks of chronic stress exposure. Enhanced AMPA receptor function in chronically stressed animals ameliorated the lasting effects of the chronic stress exposure on physiological, neuroendocrine and behavioural parameters. Our data suggest that differences in AMPA receptor function may underlie individual stress susceptibility and support AMPA receptor potentiators as potential medication in stress-related diseases.Keywords: phenotype, chronic stress, AMPA. We have subjected 120 individuals to the chronic social stress procedure, which was recently shown to result in robust effects on neuroendocrine and behavioural parameters (Sterlemann V, 2008). Following the stress procedure all animals were single housed for 7 days. Corticosterone secretion was significantly increased in the chronic stress group compared to controls after one week of single housing. Within the chronic stress group we observed a large variation, where some individuals had recovered from the stress procedure, while others still showed a largely increased corticosterone secretion. After 4 more weeks of single housing, the difference in basal corticosterone secretion between the animals susceptible to chronic stress and unsusceptible or control subjects was still evident. From the group extremes in the chronically stressed animals we selected the 6 most-affected and the 6 most resistant individuals. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the observed differences in individual stress susceptibility between these mice we laser dissected the CA1 and the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus in the selected mice and performed a gene expression profiling analysis. Pooled amplified RNA samples were then hybridised on Illumina mouse BeadChips (N=4 per group) and detected in the Illumina BeadArray Reader (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA).",

Background: The development of a new drug from candidate to market is a complex process requiring vast resources of time, money and personnel. The rate of failure in the development pipeline is enormous, leading to wasted resources that could have been better employed on alternative candidates. The requirement for early stage prediction of toxicity is, then, of paramount importance to expedite the introduction of new therapies to clinical practice. To date, most transcriptomics efforts to solve this problem have applied Support Vector Machine techniques to data derived from in vivo studies in rats.Results: We applied a toxicogenomics approach to determine whether known renal toxicants could be identified as such from their effects on the transcriptome of the human renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line, HK-2. Based on clustering of differentially expressed genes, we identified 3 toxicity groups within the set of compounds. We used Random Forest to generate a classifier to accurately place compounds in groups. The classifier is based on a signature biomarker comprising 21 genes identified by Random Forest and could differentiate between the groups with high accuracy. Furthermore, we could correctly classify external samples from a dataset exhibiting a marked 'batch effect'.Conclusions: No toxicity-associated gene expression alterations could be identified across a set of toxic compounds. Random Forest is a suitable technique for the classification of compounds into toxicity groups. Using a measure of differential expression rather than expression level per se generates a robust classifier that can potentially be applied in a platform-independent manner. Gene expression changes in HK-2 cells were measured following exposure to 9 different compounds over a range of doses and time-points with the aim of finding biological signatures of toxicity. Clustering of the resulting gene expression data revealed 3 groups of nephrotoxic compounds (Tox 1, Tox 2 and Tox 3), each exhibiting their own distinct effect on HK-2 cells.This study measures gene expression changes following exposure to CsA, Fk, Nnm, Ra, or control over 12 hrs, 24 hrs, and/or 48 hrs.

Despite its key role in Alzheimer pathogenesis, the physiological function(s) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and of its proteolytic fragments are still poorly understood. The secreted APPsa ectodomain has been shown to be involved in neuroprotection and synaptic plasticity. The g-secretase generated APP intracellular domain, AICD, functions as a transcriptional regulator in heterologous reporter assays although its role for endogenous gene regulation has remained controversial. Previously, we have generated APPsa knockin (KI) mice expressing solely the secreted ectodomain APPsa. Here, we generated double mutants (APPsa-DM) by crossing APPsa-KI mice onto an APLP2-deficient background and show that APPsa rescues the postnatal lethality of the majority of APP/APLP2 double knockout mice. Despite normal CNS morphology and unaltered basal synaptic transmission, young APPsa-DM mice already showed pronounced hippocampal dysfunction, impaired spatial learning and a deficit in LTP.

Here we defined RBPs in healthy and diseased primary cardiomyocytes at a system-wide level by RNA Interactome Capture. This identified 67 novel cardiomyocyte specific RBPs including several contractile proteins. Furthermore, we identified Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 4 (Cpeb4) as a dynamic mRBP in diseased cardiomyocytes, regulating cardiac growth both in vitro and in vivo. To study Cpeb4 in cardiomyocytes, we identified mRNAs bound to and regulated by Cpeb4. Cpeb4 regulates cardiac remodeling by differential expression of transcription factors. Among Cpeb4 target mRNAs, two Zinc finger transcription factors (Zeb1 and Zbtb20) were identified. We show that Cpeb4 regulates the translation of these mRNAs and that Cpeb4 depletion increases their expression. Thus, Cpeb4 emerges as critical regulator of cardiomyocyte function by differential binding of specific mRNAs in response to pathological growth stimulation.

The product of the ecotropic virus integration site 1 (EVI1) gene, whose overexpression is associated with a poor prognosis in myeloid leukemias and some epithelial tumors, regulates gene transcription both through direct DNA binding and through modulation of the activity of other sequence specific transcription factors. Previous results from our laboratory have shown that EVI1 influenced transcription regulation in response to the myeloid differentiation inducing agent, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), in a dual manner: it enhanced ATRA induced transcription of the RARb gene, but repressed the ATRA induction of the EVI1 gene itself. In the present study, we asked whether EVI1 would modulate the ATRA regulation of a larger number of genes, as well as biological responses to this agent, in human myeloid cells. U937 and HL-60 cells ectopically expressing EVI1 through retroviral transduction were subjected to microarray based gene expression analysis, and to assays measuring cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. These experiments showed that EVI1 modulated the ATRA response of several dozens of genes, and in fact reinforced it in the vast majority of cases. A particularly strong synergy between EVI1 and ATRA was observed for GDF15, which codes for a member of the TGF-b superfamily of cytokines. In line with the gene expression results, EVI1 enhanced cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis in response to ATRA, and knockdown of GDF15 counteracted some of these effects. HL60 cells transduced with an EVI1 expression vector or empty vector as a control were treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or an equivalent amount of DMSO (solvent) for 24 h prior to gene expression microarray analysis. 3 biological replicates were performed.",

A major task in analyzing alternative splicing (AS) by RNA-Seq is to explore and quantify the differential representation of various splice classes and the protein-coding potential of the mapped reads. To this end, we have generated a streamlined bioinformatic pipeline available to the scientific community, which maps RNA-Seq reads to a complex combinatorial database of exon-exon junctions for the unique junction discovery, PTC detection and identification of splice isoforms. Hence, we have incorporated a splice isoform inference and PTC detection algorithm, which facilitates a highly accurate mapping and prediction of splice isoform junctions and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)-susceptibility. We used this pipeline to investigate the complexity of the transcriptome and global role of AS-NMD in vivo in mammalian cells, by taking advantage of our Upf2 conditional knock-out mouse. Using tissue-specific Cre deleter strains, we have previously demonstrated in vivo that NMD acts to degrade many transcripts that results from AS. Also, ablating UPF2 (a core NMD factor) in the mouse leads to rapid mortality and collapse of most organs tested (Thoren et al., 2010; Weischenfeldt et al., 2008), suggesting an essential function for NMD in AS. To explore the effect of NMD on global splicing and to generate and validate an attractive bioinformatic pipeline for the scientific community to study AS and NMD, we chose to analyze two different mammalian organ systems with distinct phenotypes upon UPF2 ablation to test the robustness and dynamic range of the analysis. In one end of the spectrum, we chose to analyze the liver, wherein removal of UPF2 results in failure in liver metabolism and a high mortality rate (Thoren et al., 2010). To profile a less affected tissue, we chose to analyze bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). These are macrophages that differentiate in vitro and Upf2 deleted BMMs are completely devoid of NMD activity but nevertheless show no morphological or functional phenotype compared to wild-type controls (Weischenfeldt et al., 2008). Thus, we were able to make a direct comparison between these two tissues to demonstrate the potency of our Isoform and PTC detection pipeline described below, which will allow the scientific community to analyze transcriptome data for global AS and NMD-susceptibility.

Mitochondria fulfill vital metabolic functions and act as crucial cellular signaling hubs integrating their metabolic status into the cellular context. Here, we show that defective cardiolipin-remodeling, upon loss of the cardiolipin acyl transferase Tafazzin, mutes HIF-1a signaling in hypoxia. Tafazzin-deficiency does not affect posttranslational HIF-1a regulation but rather HIF-1a gene-expression, a dysfunction recapitulated in iPSCs-derived cardiomyocytes from Barth Syndrome patients with Tafazzin-deficiency. RNAseq analyses confirmed drastically altered signaling in Tafazzin mutant cells. In hypoxia, Tafazzin-deficient cells display reduced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) perturbing NF-kB activation and concomitantly HIF-1a gene-expression. In agreement, Tafazzin-deficient mice hearts display reduced HIF-1a levels and undergo maladaptive hypertrophy with heart failure in response to pressure overload challenge. We conclude that defective mitochondrial cardiolipin-remodeling dampens HIF-1a signaling through inactivation of a non-canonical signaling pathway: Lack of NF-kB activation through reduced mitochondrial ROS production diminishes HIF-1a transcription.

Here we show that SNPs are highly enriched at mouse strain-selective adipose tissue binding sites for PPARg, a nuclear receptor for antidiabetic drugs. Many such SNPs alter binding motifs for PPARg or cooperating factors, and functionally regulate nearby genes whose expression is strain-selective and imbalanced in heterozygous F1 mice. Moreover, genetically-determined binding of PPARg accounts for mouse strain-specific transcriptional effects of TZD drugs, providing proof-of- concept for personalized medicine related to nuclear receptor genomic occupancy. In human fat, motif-altering SNPs cause differential PPARg binding, provide a molecular mechanism for some expression quantitative trait loci, and are risk factors for dysmetabolic traits in genome- wide association studies. One PPARg motif-altering SNP is associated with HDL levels and other metabolic syndrome parameters.

Here we report the characterization of a novel role for the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) as a regulator of osteoblast adhesion. Abrogation of pRb in osteoblasts resulted in aberrant cadherin expression and loss of adherens junctions. This produced defects suggestive of a transformed phenotype such as impaired cell-to-cell adhesion, loss of contact-dependent growth arrest, and the capacity to evade anoikis. This also resulted in profound abnormalities in bone structure. Consistent with this, microarray analyses showed that pRb regulates a wide repertoire of osteoblast cell adhesion genes. In addition, pRb loss also resulted in altered expression and function of several known regulators of cellular adhesion and adherens junction assembly, such as the Rho GTPase Rac1 and the merlin tumor suppressor. Taken together, our results show that pRb controls cell adhesion by regulating the expression and adherens junction components and by regulating the function of molecules involved in adherens junction assembly and stability.Microarray results helped us to portrait the overall influence on cell adhesion via both individual genes and pathway analysis.

Gene-expression profiles of hepatic stellate cells isolated from IL15R-alpha knockout mouseIL-15 and its high affinity receptor IL-15Ra are widely expressed in immune cells including dendritic cells and macrophages and non-immune cells such as hepatocytes, oval cells and hepatic stellate cells (HSC). IL-15 signaling has important functions in natural killers (NK), natural killers T (NKT) and cytotoxic T (CD8+T) cell homeostasis and also in liver regeneration. We hypothesized that IL-15 may have a protective role during liver fibrosis progression due to its role in NK cell homeostasis. We compared fibrosis progression in IL-15Ra knockout mice (IL-15RaKO) to wild type mice using two mechanistically distinct models, chronic carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) exposure and bile duct ligation (BDL). Enhanced fibrosis progression was observed in IL-15RaKO mice in both models. Furthermore, using congenic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), we demonstrated an unexpected role for IL-15 signaling in hepatic resident cells for the maintenance of liver NK and CD8+T cell populations. Using this approach, transplanting IL-15RKO hematopoietic cells results in NK defect that surprisingly is not reflected in a change of fibrosis progression. However, chimeric mice with defect of IL-15R on liver resident cells have similar NK defects and significant more fibrosis after CCL4 liver injury. This supports a direct protective, anti-fibrogenic role for IL-15R on one of the radioresistant liver cell populations (hepatocytes, HSC and sessile Kupffer cells). Microarray analysis of IL15RKO HSC suggests up-regulation of collagen transcripts and down-regulation of pathways involved in cell proliferation/survival. Finally, activated HSCs isolated from IL-15RKO mice show increased collagen secretion and as predicted, no changes in the growth curves. In summary, IL-15Ra signaling has an anti-fibrotic effect through both BM-derived and hepatic resident cells. These findings establish a rationale to explore IL-15 signaling in HSC as a potential therapeutic target in liver fibrogenesis. Six week-old female IL-15RKO and wild type (WT) B6/129 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). All procedures were performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Protocols of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Mouse HSCs were isolated from WT and IL-15RKO mice using an established method with modifications.

During epithelial tissue morphogenesis, developmental progenitor cells undergo dynamic adhesive and cytoskeletal remodeling to trigger proliferation and migration. Transcriptional mechanisms that restrict such mild form of epithelial plasticity to maintain lineage-restricted differentiation in committed epithelial tissues are poorly understood. Here we report that simultaneous ablation of transcriptional repressor-encoding Ovol1 and Ovol2 results in expansion and blocked terminal differentiation of embryonic epidermal progenitor cells. Conversely, mice overexpressing Ovol2 in their skin epithelia exhibit precocious differentiation accompanied by smaller progenitor cell compartments. We show that Ovol1/2-deficient epidermal cells fail to undertake alpha-catenin-driven actin cytoskeletal reorganization and adhesive maturation, and exhibit changes that resemble epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Remarkably, these alterations as well as defective terminal differentiation are reversed upon depletion of EMT-promoting transcriptional factor Zeb1. Collectively, our findings reveal Ovol-Zeb1-a-catenin sequential repression and highlight novel functions of Ovol as gatekeepers of epithelial adhesion and differentiation by inhibiting progenitor-like traits and epithelial plasticity.

Starting at 28 days of age, P rats were given concurrent access to 15 and 30 % ethanol for 3 one-h sessions for 5 consecutive days each week until they were 49 days old. Rats were killed by decapitation 3 h after the first ethanol access session on the 15th day of drinking. RNA was prepared from micropunch samples of the nucleus accumbens shell (Acb-sh) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Ethanol intakes were 2.5 - 3.0 g/kg/session. There were 154 and 182 unique named genes that significantly differed (FDR = 0.2) between the water and ethanol group in the Acb-sh and CeA, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) analyses indicated that adolescent binge drinking produced changes in the in biological processes involved in cell proliferation and regulation of cellular structure in the Acb-sh, and in neuron projection and positive regulation of cellular organization in the CeA. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis indicated that, in the Acb-sh, there were several major intracellular signaling pathways (e.g., cAMP-mediated and protein kinase A signaling pathways) altered by adolescent drinking, with 3-fold more genes up-regulated than down-regulated in the alcohol group. The cAMP-mediated signaling system was also up-regulated in the CeA of the alcohol group. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) indicated significant G-protein coupled receptor signaling and transmembrane receptor protein kinase signaling categories in the Acb-sh and CeA, respectively.

Recent liver transcriptome analysis in this animal compared to wild-derived mice revealed higher expression of alpha2-macroglobulin (A2M) and cell adhesion molecules, which contribute to the naked mole-rat's cancer resistance. Notably, A2M is known to dramatically decrease with age in humans. We hypothesize that this might facilitate tumor development. Here we found that A2M modulates tumor cell adhesion, migration and growth by inhibition of tumor promoting signalling pathways, e.g. PI3K / AKT, SMAD and up-regulated PTEN via down-regulation of miR-21, in vitro and in tumor xenografts. A2M increases the expression of CD29 and CD44 but did not evoke EMT. Transcriptome analysis of A2M-treated tumor cells, xenografts and mouse liver demonstrated a multifaceted regulation of tumor promoting signalling pathways indicating a less tumorigenic environment mediated by A2M. By virtue of these multiple actions the naturally occurring A2M has strong potential as a novel therapeutic agent. 11 samples: 5 treated with PBS, 6 treated with A2M.",

Herein we evaluated the immunoregulatory properties of histone deacetylase (HDAC) and bromodomain inhibitors, two classes of drugs that modulate the epigenome, with a focus on key cell subsets that are engaged in an immune response. By evaluating human peripheral blood and NSCLC tumors, we show that the selective HDAC6 inhibitor ricolinostat promotes phenotypic changes that support enhanced T cell activation and improved function of antigen presenting cells. The bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 attenuated CD4+Foxp3+ T regulatory cell suppressive function and synergized with ricolinostat to facilitate immune-mediated tumor growth arrest, leading to prolonged survival of mice with lung adenocarcinomas.

Introduction: The mouse skeletal muscle is composed of four distinct fiber types that differ in contractile function, number of mitochondria and metabolism. Every muscle group has a specificcomposition and distribution of the four fiber types. Until now, three genes (CnA, PGC1a and PPARd) are identified that are involved in the generation of more oxidative muscle types. In the presentstudy we searched for novel genes that are involved in specifying different muscle types. Methods: Gastrocnemius and quadriceps muscles were dissected from 20-week old C57BL/6J mice. Geneexpression profiles were compared at the level of the whole-transcriptome. The diet-sensitivity of genes differentially expressed between muscle types was explored by comparing mice fed a low fatdiet with mice fed a high fat diet. Results: We identified 162 differentially expressed genes in the gastrocnemius as compared with the quadriceps. Genes with the strongest regulations were markers foroxidative fiber types, Hoxd8, Hoxd9 and Hoxd10 and others involved in embryogenesis. Additionally, diet did not influence the expression levels of genes specifying muscle types. Finally, whenextrapolating our data to the soleus we could not find a corresponding gene expression pattern between Hoxd8, Hoxd9 and any of the fiber-type specific markers. However, based on these geneexpression patterns we could distinguish the gastrocnemius, quadriceps and soleus from each other. Conclusion: Hoxd genes and genes that are markers for the different fiber types specify muscletype in a diet-independent way. The aim of the present study was to find novel genes that may play a role in specifying muscle types.

MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small, non-coding RNAs mediating post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. miRNAs have recently been implicated in hippocampus-dependent functions such as learning and memory, although the roles of individual miRNAs in these processes remain largely unknown. Here, we achieved stable inhibition using AAV-delivered miRNA sponges of individual, highly expressed and brain-enriched miRNAs; miR-124, miR-9 and miR-34, in hippocampal neurons. Molecular and cognitive studies revealed a role for miR-124 in learning and memory. Inhibition of miR-124 resulted in an enhanced spatial learning and working memory capacity, potentially through altered levels of genes linked to synaptic plasticity and neuronal transmission. In contrast, inhibition of miR-9 or miR-34 led to a decreased capacity of spatial learning and of reference memory, respectively. On a molecular level, miR-9 inhibition resulted in altered expression of genes related to cell adhesion, endocytosis and cell death, while miR-34 inhibition caused transcriptome changes linked to neuroactive ligand-receptor transduction and cell communication. In summary, this study establishes distinct roles for individual miRNAs in hippocampal function. Three RNA samples containing bilateral entire hippocampi from three different mice, per group. Group 1 were injected with vector containing GFP and a miR34sp/miR9sp and the other group were subjected to a vector expressing GFP only.",

Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) acting as negative regulators of gene expression are differentially expressed in intestinal tissues of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Assessing the functional role of miRNAs in murine models of colitis facilitates elucidating the role of specific miRNAs in human IBD. The aim of this study was to determine the miRNA signature of murine models of colitis and to assess the influence of miR-21 on intestinal inflammation. Methods: miRNAs expression was accessed by microarray for acute and chronic murine model of colitis induced by DSS or TNBS. miR-21-deficient mouse and littermates controls were assessed in the standard DSS, TNBS and CD4+ T cell transfer models of colitis. RNAs of mouse colon and CD4+CD45RBHigh cells were analyzed by miRNA and mRNA microarray, and quantitative RT-PCR. Th1 polarization was accessed by flow-cytometry and ELISA. Results: Alterations of in miRNAs expression were identified for acute and chronic DSS colitis and TNBS colitis, receptively. The Expression of miRs-21, -142-3p and -223 was were distinct between DSS and TNBS models while overlap of numerous miRNAs was seen. Importantly, miRs-19b, -192 and -215, that are decreased in IBD, were significantly decreased in all 4 models of colitis. miR-21, which is increased in IBD, was increased in TNBS colitis but not the DSS colitis models. Further assessment of the miR-21-deficient 1-/- mice revealed that the deletion of miR-21 results in the exacerbation of both the TNBS and T cell-transfer models of colitis. Conclusions: miRNAs are differentially expressed in both human IBD and murine colitis, with overlap of several IBD-associated miRNAs. The demonstration that miR-21 deletion exacerbated CD4+ T cell-mediated models of colitis provides further evidence that miRNAs play significant roles in the pathogenesis of IBD.

Background: Toll-like family of receptors recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from different organisms. TLR4 is the receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), dsRNA viral mimic poly(I:C) binds to TLR3, and bacterial CpG DNA signals through TLR9. TLR4 signaling is mediated by adaptor molecules Myd88 and TRIF while TLR3 pathway involves only the TRIF adaptor and TLR9 signals solely through Myd88. Methods: To identify genes other than those in TLR pathways that mediate macrophage response to different PAMPs, RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS, poly(I:C), or CpG DNA, and RNA was profiled on microarrays 6 hrs and 24 hrs post-treatment. Gene expression data were analyzed to determine genes, pathways and transcriptional networks that are in common and unique to each of the three TLR stimuli. Potentially novel candidates revealed by this analysis were tested for their role in innate immunity using RNA interference. Results: Many genes are differentially regulated by LPS and poly(I:C) at both 6 hrs and 24 hrs following treatment, while CpG DNA elicits a much less pronounced transcriptional response. By analyzing gene expression data for networks and pathways, we prioritized differentially expressed genes that are in common to all three PAMPs as well as those shared by LPS and poly(I:C). Knockdown by RNA interference of two genes, Plec1 and TPST1, inhibited production of IL-6 in response to LPS in cultured macrophages. Conclusions: We have identified novel innate immunity genes that may be important in macrophage response to LPS, poly(I:C), and CpG DNA stimuli. Our results provide potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets that should be further investigated in mice and human populations.Keywords: time course.

    "text": "CHUK/IKKalpha loss in lung epithelial cells enhances NSCLC growth associated with HIF up-regulation. During the natural progression of Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), tumor cells evolve progressively through the accumulation of mutations, some of which involve oncogenic (K-RAS, EGFR) or tumor suppressor (P53) genes. These mutations alter cell signaling pathways to promote tumor growth and survival in the tumor microenvironment. Herein we show that CHUK (IKK-alpha) acts as a prominent tumor suppressor in two independent NSCLC models.Using a novel transgenic mouse strain, where IKK-alpha gene is ablated using tamoxifen in alveolar type II epithelial cells, loss of IKK-alpha increased the number and size of lung tumors in response to the chemical carcinogen urethane. Furthermore, IKK-alpha knock-down in three human NSCLC lines (showing independent K-Ras or p53 mutations and status) promoted their growth as xenografts in immunocompromised mice. Transcriptomic and functional studies of IKK-alpha knock-down tumors, relative to their wild type counterparts, suggested that the loss of IKK-alpha promoted the activation of HIF-1 alpha and higher tumor cell growth and survival under hypoxic conditions.Together, these results suggest that IKK-alpha acts as a tumor suppressor by suppressing the activity of HIF-1 alpha and tumor cell growth/survival under hypoxic conditions. Tumor RNA samples were sequenced in quadruplicateRNAseq was performed in Human and mouse WT and CHUK-Knockdown NSCLC tumors or tumor xenografts. For human tumor xenografts, three independent human Wt or CHUK-knockdown NSCLC lines (H1437, A549 and H1299), which differ either in their p53 or K-Ras functional status were obtained from the Sanger (UK) cell line database, which provides the status of their K-Ras and p53, EGFR, ARF and p16 alleles. These three human NSCLC lines (IKK WT and IKK KD) and H1299 and A549 (p52WT and p52KD) were grown as tumor xenografts by subcutaneous transplantation into either side (Left side for WT and right side for KD cells) of immune compromised 5 week old NSG (NOD-SCID-IL2Rgamma) mice (2 x 10^6 cells per injection in 200 ml of PBS). Mice were sacrificed 3 weeks and part of the dissected tumors was immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to RNA extraction with the TRI-Reagent (Merck) protocol, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For mouse tumors, Mice with IKKa allele containing LoxP recombination sites and a ROSA-fLacz Cre-inducible LacZ reporter gene were crossed with Sftpc-CreERT2 mice (Rock et al., 2011), which harbor a tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 recombinase under the control of the Sftpc gene promoter that is only active in alveolar type II (AT-II) lung epithelial cells. To induce either IKK or IKK deletion in AT-II lung epithelial cells six week-old male or female mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 5 consecutive days with 2mg tamoxifen (Sigma) dissolved in corn oil. To induce NSCLCs, one week after tamoxifen administration mice received weekly i.p. urethane injections (1g/kg) (Sigma) dissolved in PBS for 12 consecutive weeks, and were sacrificed 6 months after the first urethane injection.",

Using probe sequences matched at the exon level improved consistency of measurements across the different microarray platforms compared to annotation-based matches. Generally, consistency was good for highly expressed genes, and variable for genes with lower expression values as confirmed by QRT-PCR.

    "text": "Comparison of Human and Rat Uterine Leiomyoma: Identification of a Dysregulated mTOR Pathway. Uterine leiomyomata, or fibroids, are benign tumors of the uterine myometrium that significantly affect up to 30% of reproductive-age women. Despite being the primary cause of hysterectomy in the United States, accounting for up to 200,000 procedures annually, the etiology of leiomyoma remains largely unknown. Due to the lack of an effective medicinal therapy for these tumors, this disease continues to have a tremendous negative impact on women's health. As a basis for understanding leiomyoma pathogenesis and identifying targets for pharmacotherapy, we conducted transcriptional profiling of leiomyoma and unaffected myometrium from humans and Eker rats, the best characterized preclinical model of leiomyoma. A global comparison of mRNA from leiomyoma versus myometrium in human and rat identified a highly significant overlap of dysregulated gene expression in leiomyoma. An unbiased pathway analysis using a method of gene set enrichment based on the Sigpathway algorithm detected the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway as one of the most highly upregulated pathways in both human and rat tumors. Activation of this pathway was confirmed in both human and rat leiomyomata at the protein level via Western. Inhibition of mTOR in female Eker rats with the rapamycin analog WAY-129327 for 2 weeks decreased mTOR signaling and cell proliferation in tumors, and treatment for 4 months significantly decreased tumor incidence, multiplicity and size. These results identify dysregulated mTOR signaling as a component of leiomyoma etiology across species and directly demonstrate the dependence of these tumors on mTOR signaling for growth in the Eker rat. Modulation of this pathway warrants additional investigation as a potential therapy for uterine leiomyoma.Keywords: Disease State Analysis: Animal Model Validation. We analyzed 1-3 leiomyoma or normal myometrium biopsies from each 23 woman undergoing hysterectomy for the treatment of uterine fibroids. tment and compared it leiomyoma and normal myometrium from the Eker rat model of uterine fibroids (N=14-15).",

Lysine methyltransferases G9a and GLP (G9a- Like Protein) form functional heterodimeric complexes that establish mono- and dimethylation on histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me1, H3K9me2) in euchromatin. Here we describe unexpected opposite individual roles for G9a and GLP during skeletal muscle terminal differentiation. Indeed, gain- or loss-of-function assays in myoblasts showed that in consistency with previous reports that G9a inhibits terminal differentiation. But GLP plays a more complicated role in muscle differentiation since both knockdown and overexpression inhibits terminal differentiation. Unexpectedly, in contrast to G9a, we show that GLP overexpression promotes abnormal expression of muscle differentiationspecific genes in proliferating myoblasts. Transcriptomic analysis indicates that G9a and GLP regulate different sets of genes. GLP, but not G9a, inhibits at the transcriptional level proteasome subunit-encoding genes resulting in an inhibition of the proteasome activities. Subsequently, GLP, but not G9a, overexpression stabilizes MyoD that is likely to be responsible for muscle markers expression in proliferating myoblasts.

There is evidence that the stromal compartment may influence breast cancer responsiveness to chemotherapy. Our aim was to detect a stromal cell signature (using a direct approach of microdissected stromal cells) associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer, considering tumor down staging (to at least ypT1a/b,ypN0), as the best response. Patients and methods. Forty four patients diagnosed with locally advanced breast cancer (29 classified as estrogen receptor (ER) positive and 15, as ER negative) were included. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisted of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide, followed by paclitaxel. Response was defined as downstaging to maximum ypT1a-b/ypN0. Stromal cells were microdissected from fresh frozen tumor samples and gene expression profile was determined using Agilent SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression Microarrays. Expression levels were compared using MeV (MultiExperiment Viewer) software, applying SAM (Significance analysis of microarrays). Gene set enrichment analysis was used to identify gene sets correlated with the phenotype downstaging. Results: After chemotherapy, nine patients presented disease downstaging to maximum ypT1a-b/ypN0. Using SAM test (FDR 17), 11 sequences were differentially expressed, all of which (except for H2AFJ) more expressed in responsive tumors. Gene list enrichment analysis revealed three genes involved in abnormal cytotoxic T cell physiology: TOX, LY75 and SH2D1A. Gene sets correlated with tumor downstaging (FDR < 0.01), were mainly involved in immune response or lymphocyte activation, both in ER positive and ER negative samples. Conclusion: In locally advanced breast cancer, stromal cells may present specific features of immune response that may be associated with chemotherapy response. Stromal cells were microdissected from fresh frozen tumor samples and gene expression profile was determined using Agilent SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression Microarrays. Expression levels were compared using MeV (MultiExperiment Viewer) software, applying SAM (Significance analysis of microarrays).

In the present manuscript we show that T cells within tumors are highly radio-resistant compared to T cells in lymphoid organs. To better understand this different response to ionizing radiation (IR), gene expression is compared for T cells from lymph nodes and those from transplantable MC38 tumors, in mice treated or not with whole body irradiation. We find that T cells from tumors and lymph nodes respond similarly to IR in terms of gene expression, and this response is dominated by p53 signaling. In contrast, gene expression at baseline (i.e. in the absence of radiation) shows profound differences between T cells from tumors and T cells from lymph nodes, and suggests transcriptomic reprogramming of the intratumoral T cells in the tumor microenvironment . .

The molecular mechanisms that lead to the cognitive defects characteristic of Down syndrome (DS), the most frequent cause of mental retardation, have remained elusive. Here we use a transgenic DS mouse model to show that DYRK1A gene dosage imbalance deregulates chromosomal clusters of genes located near neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) binding sites. We found that DYRK1A binds the SWI/SNF-complex known to interact with REST/NRSF. Mutation of a REST/NRSF binding site in the promoter of the REST/NRSF target gene L1cam modifies the transcriptional effect of Dyrk1A-dosage imbalance on L1cam. DyrkA dosage imbalance perturbs Rest/Nrsf levels with decreased Rest/Nrsf expression in embryonic neurons and increased expression in adult neurons. We identified a coordinated deregulation of multiple genes that are responsible for the cellular phenotypic traits present in DS such as dendritic growth impairment and microcephaly during prenatal cortex development. Dyrk1a overexpression in primary mouse cortical neurons reduced the neuritic complexity. In the postnatal hippocampus, DYRK1A overexpression suppresses a form of synaptic plasticity that may be sufficient to cause DS cognitive defects. We propose that DYRK1A overexpression-related neuronal gene deregulation generates the brain phenotypic changes that characterize DS, with an accessory role for the gene dosage imbalance of other chromosome 21 genes. Agilent Whole Mouse Genome oligomicroarrays (GEO accession no. GPL2872, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) were used. They contain 60-mer DNA probes synthesized in situ in a 44k format. Of 44,290 spots, 2756 are controls. The remaining 41,534 spots represent 33,661 unique transcripts which correspond to 20,202 unique human genes.

Behaviour is derived from complex molecular interactions within the brain, in response to specific environmental stimuli. In some rare cases, the direct causes of behaviour have been attributed to the interactions of a single or small group of gene transcripts and proteins. We conducted two experiments with the hope of defining some of the molecular interactors for four separate behaviours: sugar feeding, locomotor activity in a novel field, and acoustic startle reflex, and prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex, which have been linked to prefrontal cortex dopaminergic function or as predictors of sensorimotor gating in diseases such as schizophrenia. Rats with high and low response phenotypes were selected to determine the differences between these two extremes of behaviour. From our analyses, transcripts of Homer1, a neuronal scaffolding protein which interacts with group1 metabotropic glutamate receptors, were found to be significantly correlated with array data in both experiments, and with behaviour data across three separate tests in the second experiment, indicating that this gene's transcripts and probably downstream protein interactions have a significant correlation with behaviour phenotype in the inbred Lewis rat. Future areas of pursuit for this data should involve modification of the expression of Homer1 in an isolated fashion to determine a pharmacological threshold for differences in behaviour.Keywords: Phenotype-Association Study.

Despite the ever-increasing speed of detecting fusion transcripts in cancer, it remains formidable to predict what unreported RNA pairs can form new fusion transcripts. By systematic mapping of chromatin-associated RNAs (caRNAs) and their respective genomic interaction loci, we obtained genome-wide RNA-DNA interaction maps from two non-cancerous cell types. The gene pairs involved in RNA-DNA interactions in these normal cells exhibited strong overlap with those with cancer-derived fusion transcripts. These data suggest an RNA-poise model, where the spatial proximity of one gene's transcripts and the other gene's genomic sequence poises for the creation of fusion transcripts. We validated this model with 96 additional lung cancer samples. One of these additional samples exhibited fusion transcripts without a corresponding fusion gene, suggesting that genome-recombination is not a required step of the RNA-poise model.

Current smokers develop metastatic prostate cancer more frequently than nonsmokers, suggesting that a tobacco-derived factor induces metastasis. To identify smoking-induced alterations in human prostate tumors, we analyzed gene and protein expression of tumors from current, past, and never smokers and observed distinct molecular alterations in current smokers. Specifically, an immune and inflammation signature was identified in prostate tumors of current smokers that was either attenuated or absent in past and never smokers. Key characteristics of this signature included augmented immunoglobulin expression by tumor-infiltrating B cells, NF-kB activation, and increased interleukin-8 in tumor and blood. In an alternate approach to characterize smoking-induced oncogenic alterations, we explored the effects of nicotine in prostate cancer cells and prostate cancer-prone TRAMP mice. These experiments showed that nicotine increases both invasiveness of human prostate cancer cells and metastasis in tumor-bearing TRAMP mice, indicating that nicotine can induce a phenotype that resembles the epidemiology of smoking-associated prostate cancer progression. In summary, we describe distinct oncogenic alterations in prostate tumors from current smokers and show that nicotine can enhance prostate cancer metastasis.

    "text": "Neuron susceptibility to seizure-induced injury. Dingledine-5R01NS031373-10-2. Neurodegenerative brain disorders become more common in the aged. Most of these disorders are associated with or caused by selective death of certain neuronal subpopulations. The mechanisms underlying the differential vulnerability of certain neuronal populations are still largely unexplored and few neuroprotective treatments are available to date. Elucidation of these mechanisms may lead to a greater understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, preconditioning by a short seizure confers neuroprotection following a subsequent prolonged seizure. Our goal is to identify pathways that confer vulnerability and resistance to neurotoxic conditions by comparing the basal and preconditioned gene expression profiles of three differentially vulnerable hippocampal neuron populations.Hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons are highly susceptible to seizures and ischemia, whereas dentate gyrus granule cells are relatively resistant. A brief preconditioning seizure confers protection to the pyramidal cells. We will first determine gene expression profiles of untreated rat CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells, and dentate granule cells, using laser capture microscopy to obtain region-specific neuronal mRNA. We will then determine the effect of a brief preconditioning seizure, which is neuroprotective in CA1 and CA3, on these expression profiles.We hypothesize that common molecular mechanisms exist in neurons that determine their susceptibility to seizure-induced injury. Intrinsic differences in gene expression exist between hippocampal glutamatergic CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons, on the one hand, and dentate granule cells on the other, which contribute to the greater susceptibility of pyramidal neurons to degeneration in experimental stroke and epilepsy. We specifically hypothesize that differences in basal energy metabolism genes may confer differential susceptibility to neurodegeneration produced by seizures and ischemia.Anesthetized animals will be sacrificed by decapitation, and frozen 10 micron sections will be lightly stained with cresyl violet to identify cell layers in the hippocampus. Approximately 1000 neurons from each of the three cell layers will be isolated by LCM. Poly-A RNA will be amplified using a modified Eberwine protocol. The quality of our aRNA will be evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR of GluR6 and KA2 mRNA levels before we send the samples to the Center for labeling and hybridization to Affymetrix rat 230A arrays. We will provide a one-round amplification cDNA product to the center for labeling and hybridization.

These human blood vessel organoids contain endothelial cells and pericytes that self-assemble into interconnected capillary networks enveloped by a basement membrane. Human blood vessel organoids transplanted into mice form a stable, perfused human vascular tree, including human arteries, arterioles and venules. Exposure of blood vessel organoids to hyperglycemia and inflammatory cytokines in vitro induced thickening of the basal membrane, a hallmark of human diabetic microangiopathy. Human blood vessel, exposed in vivo to a diabetic milieu in mice, also mimick the microvascular changes in diabetic patients. We finally performed a drug screen and uncovered g-secretase and DLL4-Notch3 as key drivers of \"diabetic\" vasculopathy in human blood vessels in vitro and in vivo. Thus, organoids derived from human stem cells faithfully recapitulate the structure and function of human blood vessels and are amenable to model and identify drug targets for diabetic vasculopathy, which affects hundreds of millions of patients. .

Rbfox1 is a splicing regulator that has been associated with various neurological conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, mental retardation, epilepsy, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia. We show that in adult rodent retinas, Rbfox1 is expressed in all types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) as well as in certain subsets of amacrine cells (ACs) within the inner nuclear and ganglion cell layers. In developing retinas, Rbfox1 can be detected as early as E12. At that age, Rbfox1 is localized in the cytoplasm of differentiated RGCs. Between P0 and P5, strong expression of Rbfox1 in the inner plexiform layer was observed. This coincided with switching of Rbfox1 localization in RGC somas from cytoplasmic to a predominantly nuclear. Dynamic changes in Rbfox1 expression during first 10 postnatal days are correlated with the stage II spontaneous retinal waves of excitation, which in mice begins around the time of birth and continues for as long as two weeks. By P10, dendritic staining of Rbfox1 was dramatically reduced and remained so in the fully developed retina. In Rbfox1 knockout (KO) animals no detectable changes in retinal gross morphology were observed two months after Rbfox1 downregulation. However, the visual cliff test revealed marked abnormalities of depth perception of these animals. Retinal transcriptome analysis of Rbfox1 KO mice identified a number of genes that are involved in establishing neural circuits and synaptic transmission, including Vamp1, Vamp2, Snap25, Trak2, and Slc1A7, suggesting a role of Rbfox1 in the regulation of genes that facilitate AC and RGC synaptic communication. Retinal RNRetinal RNA-seq analysis was performed with 3 biological replicates representing Rbfox1-/- and 3 biological replicates representing control animals to identify differentially expressed and alternatively spliced genes.

The observed phenotype was environment-dependent and could be induced by infection with parasitic nematodes. Rbpj-deficient Treg cells adopted open chromatin landscapes and gene expression profiles reminiscent of tissue-derived TH2-polarized Treg cells, with a prevailing footprint of transcription factor Gata-3.

The transcriptional regulator EVI1 has an essential role in early hematopoiesis and development. However, aberrantly high expression of EVI1 has potent oncogenic properties and confers poor prognosis and chemo-resistance in leukemia and solid tumors. To investigate to what extent EVI1 function might be regulated by posttranslational modifications, we carried out mass spectrometry- and antibody-based analyses and uncovered an ATM-mediated double phosphorylation of EVI1 at the carboxy-terminal S858/S860 SQS motif. In the presence of genotoxic stress, EVI1-WT (SQS), but not site mutated EVI1-AQA was able to maintain transcriptional patterns and transformation potency, while under standard conditions carboxy-terminal mutation had no effect. Maintenance of hematopoietic progenitor cell clonogenic potential was profoundly impaired with EVI1-AQA compared with EVI1-WT, in particular in the presence of genotoxic stress. Exploring mechanistic events underlying these observations, we showed that after genotoxic stress EVI1-WT, but not EVI1-AQA increased its level of association with its functionally essential interaction partner CtBP1, implying a role for ATM in regulating EVI1 protein interactions via phosphorylation. This aspect of EVI1 regulation is therapeutically relevant, as chemotherapy-induced genotoxicity might detrimentally sustain EVI1 function via stress response mediated phosphorylation, and ATM-inhibition might be of specific targeted benefit in EVI1-overexpressing malignancies. Poly-A RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis of EVI1-mediated modulation of gene expression RNA was extracted from HEK293 cells, which were subjected to transient transfection using half confluent cultures with pCMV-flag, pCMV-EVI1-WT-flag or pCMV-EVI1-AQA-flag, exposed to 150 mM H2O2 or left untreated for 8 h.",

Transcript analysis of mouse kidney disease models, including folic-acid-induced nephropathy, unilateral ureteral obstruction, or APOL1-associated kidney disease, indicated that Jag1 and Notch2 levels were higher in all analyzed kidney fibrosis models.

We have witnessed the rise and fall of antiangiogenic therapy in breast cancer (BC). Nevertheless, clinical remissions were observed in patients and we were interested in studying the activity of antiangiogenic drugs in BC. Inefficacy of sunitinib was observed in mouse models of metastatic BC, where evidence of enhanced metastasis was reported, and lack of efficacy of sunitinib-docetaxel combination was recently reported in a phase III clinical trial. Our aim was to understand the mechanisms and predictors of response to sunitinib in BC in a cohort of patients with untreated locally advanced or operable BC treated with an upfront window of single agent sunitinib, followed by the combination of sunitinib and docetaxel.We have used microarray profiing to monitor the transcriptional changes associated with three distinct stages of treatment: at diagnosis and prior to any treatment (t1), after an upfront window of single agent sunitinib (t2) and after the combined treatment of sunitinib and docetaxel (t3). In addtion, this microarray data also allowed us to observe the transcriptional changes associated with primary resistance to angiogenic therapy in 4 of 12 patients likely mediated by an adaptive transcriptional response to hypoxia in these resistant tumors. In BC patients this is the first demonstration of primary resistance to antiangiogenic therapy. Breast cancer samples were colected from human patients (n=8) for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Expression profiling on tumor material collected at the three timepoints, diagnosis and prior to any treatment (t1), after an upfront window of single agent Sunitinib (t2) and after the combined treatment of sunitinib and docetaxel (t3), was used to obtain an unbiased view of sunitinib response. Several tumor biopsies and specimens had no frozen sample available or RNA with insufficient quality for expression analysis. Were include in the analysis, at diagnosis (t1), replicated material from patients 4, 5, 6, 7 and 11 (patient 10 had no replica), at day 15 (t2) replicated material from patients 5, 7, 11 and 12 (patient 4 had no replica) and at surgery (t3) replicated material from patients 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12 (patient 6 had no replica).",

Gifu Prefecture and Gifu University are developing technologies for recycling used carbon fiber because the waste disposal process is highly cost and energy intensive. However, generation of carbon fiber dust during the recycling process is a serious issue, especially in the occupational environment. Recycling requires carbonization by partial firing treatment at 500 followed by firing treatment at 440: these processes produce dust as a by-product. In this study, three types of carbon fibers; before recycling, after carbonization, and after firing were evaluated for their toxic effects on mice. It is important to study the influence of carbon fibers on human health at a gene expression level. Stress induced gene expression in mouse lung was measured at 6 month after exposure to doses of 200 ug/ mouse carbon fiber by intratracheal administeration.

The glucocorticoid-activated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates cellular stress pathways by binding to genomic regulatory elements of target genes and recruiting coregulator proteins to remodel chromatin and regulate transcription complex assembly. The coregulator Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone 5 (Hic-5) is required for glucocorticoid regulation of some genes, but not others, and blocks regulation of a third gene set. Hic-5 inhibits GR binding to blocked genes but not other glucocorticoid-regulated genes. Site-specific blocking of GR binding is due to gene-specific requirements for ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes. We investigate whether ATPases CHD9 and BRM were required for glucocorticoid-regulated expression of Hic-5 blocked genes. Since Hic-5 inhibits the actions of CHD9 and BRM, we performed double depletion of Hic-5 and CHD9 or Hic-5 and BRM in U2OS-GR cell using siRNA and examined gene expression changes at 8 hour dexamethasone (dex) or ethanol (etoh, vehicle control) treatment.

Gastric cancer (GC) is the second leading cause of global cancer mortality, with individual gastric tumors displaying significant heterogeneity in their deregulation of various oncogenic pathways. We aim to identify major oncogenic pathways in GC that robustly impact patient survival and treatment response. We used an in silico strategy based on gene expression signatures and connectivity analytics to map patterns of oncogenic pathway activation in 25 unique GC cell lines, and in 301 primary gastric cancers from three independent patient cohorts. Of 11 oncogenic pathways previously implicated in GC, we identified three predominant pathways (proliferation/stem cell, NF-kB, and Wnt/b-catenin) deregulated in the majority (>70%) of gastric tumors. Using a variety of proliferative, Wnt, and NF-kB-related assays, we experimentally validated the pathway predictions in multiple GC cell lines showing similar pathway activation patterns in vitro. Patients stratified at the level of individual pathways did not exhibit consistent differences in clinical outcome. However, patients grouped by oncogenic pathway combinations demonstrated robust and significant survival differences (e.g., high proliferation/high NF-kB vs. low proliferation/low NF-kB), suggesting that tumor behavior in GC is likely influenced by the combined effects of multiple oncogenic pathways. Our results demonstrate that GCs can be successfully taxonomized by oncogenic pathway activity into biologically and clinically relevant subgroups.Keywords: gastric cancer, cell culture.

Hypertension is a condition with major cardiovascular and renal complications, affecting nearly a billion patients worldwide. Few validated gene targets are available for pharmacological intervention, so there is a need to identify new biological pathways regulating blood pressure and containing novel targets for treatment. The genetically hypertensive \"blood pressure high\" (BPH), normotensive \"blood pressure normal\" (BPN), and hypotensive \"blood pressure low\" (BPL) inbred mouse strains are an ideal system to study differences in gene expression patterns that may represent such biological pathways. We profiled gene expression in liver, heart, kidney, and aorta from BPH, BPN, and BPL mice and determined which biological processes are enriched in observed organ-specific gene signatures. As a result, we identified multiple biological pathways linked to blood pressure phenotype that could serve as a source of candidate genes causal for hypertension. In order to distinguish causal genes from responsive genes in the kidney gene signature we integrated phenotype associated genes into Genetic Bayesian networks, identifying several novel candidate genes causal for hypertension. The integration of data from gene expression profiling and genetics networks is a valuable approach to identify novel potential targets for the pharmacological treatment of hypertension. Animals:BPH/2J, BPL/1J and BPN/3J (142 +- 5 mmHg, 69 +- 1.7 mmHg, 94 +- 6 mmHg, SBP respectively) male mice (Jackson Laboratory) were maintained on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle and fed with standard chow ad libitum in facilities accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.

Genome wide association studies of human lung function have identified a signal on 4q24 but the mechanistic basis for this signal is unclear. This region contains the Integrator Complex subunit 12 gene (INTS12) and nearby polymorphisms associated with lung function correlate with INTS12 expression. We aimed to define INTS12 function in human bronchial epithelial cells. RNAseq pathway analyses of INTS12 depleted cells revealed robust downregulation of several protein synthesis related pathways, including the aminoacyl tRNA synthetases and PERK regulated gene expression. Indeed, INTS12 knockdown using mRNA silencing repressed cellular translation and proliferation. ChIPseq gene-centric analyses revealed INTS12 binding to be near transcriptional start sites. The binding was found to be enriched for differentially expressed loci identifying the genes it regulates, a finding previously unknown for this particular member of Integrator complex. These findings contribute to the biology behind genetic association. INTS12 depletion was induced in human bronchial epithelial cells from both donors. RNAseq gene expression profiling was performed 48h and 120h since the initiation of knockdown in the first and second donor respectively. Silencing was achieved with two independent D-siRNAs and experiments included scambled D-siRNA transfected and un-transfected cells. Experiments were performed in three biological replicates.

They are affected in devastating lung diseases including COPD, Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, and the major form (adenocarcinoma) of lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer deaths. The alveolar epithelium is composed of two morphologically distinct cell types: alveolar type (AT) 1 cells, exquisitely thin cells across which oxygen diffuses to reach the blood, and AT2 cells, specialized surfactant-secreting cells. Classical studies suggested that AT1 cells arise from AT2 cells during development and following injury, but more recent studies suggest other sources. Here we use histological and marker analysis, lineage tracing, and clonal analysis in mice to identify alveolar progenitor and stem cells and map their locations and potential in vivo. The results show that AT1 and AT2 cells arise independently during development from a bipotential progenitor. After birth, new AT1 cells derive from rare, long-lived, self-renewing AT2 cells, each producing a slowly expanding clonal focus of regenerated alveoli contiguous with the founder AT2 cell. This stem cell function of AT2 cells is broadly activated by diffuse AT1 cell injury, and AT2 self-renewal can be induced in vitro by EGF ligands and permanently activated in vivo by AT2 cell-specific targeting of the oncogenic KrasG12D allele, efficiently transforming AT2 cells into monoclonal adenomatous tumors that rapidly enlarge and prove fatal. Thus, there is a developmental switch in alveolar progenitor cells after birth, when mature AT2 cells function as facultative stem cells that contribute to local alveolar renewal, repair, and cancer. We propose that short-range signals from dying AT1 cells regulate AT2 stem cell activity: a signal transduced by EGFR-KRAS controls AT2 self-renewal and is hijacked during oncogenic transformation, and a separate signal controls reprogramming to AT1 cell fate. To compare expression between ATII and E18 BP populations, RNA was isolated from either population purified by FACS. Two populations are analyzed with 3 biological replicates per population.",

    "text": "5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors as hypothalamic targets of developmental programming in male rats. Though obesity is a global epidemic, the physiological mechanisms involved are little understood. Recent advances reveal that susceptibility to obesity can be programmed by maternal and neonatal nutrition. Specifically, a maternal low protein diet during pregnancy causes decreased intrauterine growth, rapid postnatal catch-up growth and increased risk for diet-induced obesity. Given that the synthesis of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is nutritionally regulated and 5-HT is a trophic factor, we hypothesized that maternal diet influences fetal 5-HT exposure, which then influences central appetite network development and the subsequent efficacy of 5-HT to control energy balance in later life. Consistent with our hypothesis, pregnant low protein fed rat mothers exhibited elevated serum 5-HT, which was also evident in the placenta and fetal brains at E16.5. This increase was associated with reduced hypothalamic expression of 5-HT2CR - the primary 5-HT receptor influencing appetite. As expected, reduced 5-HT2CR expression was associated with impaired sensitivity to 5-HT-mediated appetite suppression. 5-HT primarily achieves effects on appetite via 5-HT2CR stimulation of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) peptides within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC). We reveal that 5-HT2ARs are also anatomically positioned to influence the activity of ARC POMC and that 5-HT2AR mRNA is increased in the hypothalamus of in utero growth restricted offspring that underwent rapid postnatal catch-up growth. Furthermore, these animals are more sensitive to 5-HT2AR agonist-induced appetite suppression. These findings may not only reveal a 5-HT-mediated mechanism underlying programming of obesity susceptibility but also provide a promising means to correct it, via a 5-HT2AR agonist treatment. The study was carried out using male Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus). On postnatal day 3, two experimental groups of offspring were established: controls (offspring of control dams) and recuperated (offspring of dams fed a low-protein diet (8% protein, w/v), but nursed by control dams.

Female infertility syndromes are among the most prevalent chronic health disorders in women, but their molecular basis remains unknown because of the complexity of oogenesis and uncertainty regarding the number and identity of ovarian factors controlling the assembly, preservation, and maturation of ovarian follicles. To systematically discover such ovarian fertility factors en masse, we employed a mouse model (Foxo3), where follicles are assembled normally but are then synchronously activated. Gene expression profiling of mutant and normal ovaries led to the identification a surprisingly large set of ovarian factors. The set included the vast majority of known ovarian factors, many of which when mutated produce female sterility phenotypes, but most were novel.

    "text": "Dietary calcium inhibits colitis development in HLA-B27 transgenic rats. Background and Aims: We have shown in several controlled rat and human infection studies that dietary calcium improves intestinal resistance and strengthens the mucosal barrier. Reinforcement of gut barrier function is also relevant for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therefore, we investigated the effect of supplemental calcium on spontaneous colitis development in HLA-B27 transgenic rats, an experimental animal model of IBD.Methods: HLA-B27 transgenic rats were fed a purified high-fat diet containing either a low or high calcium content (30 and 120 mmol CaHPO4/kg diet, respectively) for almost 7 weeks. Inert chromium ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (CrEDTA) was added to the diets to quantify intestinal permeability by measuring urinary CrEDTA excretion. Relative fecal dry-weight was determined to quantify diarrhea. Colonic inflammation was determined histologically, and by measuring mucosal interleukin-1b. In addition, colonic mucosal gene expression of individual rats was analyzed, using whole genome microarrays. Interesting results were verified by Q-PCR. Results: The high-calcium diet significantly prevented the increase in intestinal permeability and diarrhea with time in HLA-B27 rats developing colitis as compared to the low-calcium group. The histological colitis score and mucosal interleukin-1b levels were lower in high-calcium fed rats. Supplemental calcium prevented the colitis-induced increase in the expression of extracellular matrix remodeling genes (e.g. matrix metalloproteinases, procollagens and fibronectin), which was confirmed by Q-PCR.Conclusions: Dietary calcium inhibits colitis development in HLA-B27 transgenic rats. Calcium prevents the colitis-related increase in intestinal permeability, diminishes diarrhea, and lowers the inflammatory response in the mucosa, resulting in less extracellular matrix breakdown. Keywords: nutritional intervention. Female HLA-B27/b2-microglobulin transgenic rats on an inbred Fisher 344 background (n=8 in experimental group and n=9 in control group) (Taconic Farms, Inc, Germantown, NY), 8-10 weeks old and with a mean body weight of 128 g at the start of the experiment, were housed individually in metabolic cages. Animals were kept in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment and in a 12-h light-dark cycle. Rats were fed a purified 'humanized' Western diet which contained in the control situation (per kg): 200 g acid casein, 326 g corn starch, 174 g glucose, 160 g palm oil, 40 g corn oil, 50 g cellulose and 5.16 g CaHPO4.2H2O (corresponding to 30 mmol calcium/kg diet; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Vitamins and minerals (other than calcium) were added to all diets according to the recommendations of the American Institute of Nutrition 1993.17 The experimental diet contained more calcium (120 mmol calcium/kg diet) at the expense of glucose.
