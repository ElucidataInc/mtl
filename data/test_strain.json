As a control, we also calculated the demethylated WCG sites in the early embryos using the cutoff: a WCG site with a methylation level over 0.75 in the former stage and with at least a 0.3 methylation level decrease in the next stage was defined as a demethylated WCG site. Because the most significant enrichment in de novo methylated WCG sites was in CGIs, we calculated how many CGIs were de novo methylated after fertilization using the following cutoff: a CGI (which was detected at least three WCG sites in a single cell and covered in at least three single cells within each stages) with a < 0.25 average methylation level in one stage and with at least a 0.3 increase in methylation level in the next stage was defined as a de novo methylated CGI.
