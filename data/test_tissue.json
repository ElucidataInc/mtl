    "text": "The psychiatric risk gene NT5C2 regulates AMPK signalling and protein translation in human neural progenitor cells . BackgroundThe cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II gene (NT5C2, cN-II) is associated with disorders characterised by psychiatric and psychomotor disturbances. Common psychiatric risk alleles at the NT5C2 locus reduce expression of this gene in the foetal and adult brain, but downstream biological risk mechanisms remain elusive.MethodsDistribution of the NT5C2 protein in the human DLPFC and cortical human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) was determined using immunostaining, publicly available expression data, and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Phosphorylation quantification of AMPK-alpha (Thr172) and ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) (Ser235/Ser236) were performed using western blotting, to infer the degree of activation of AMPK signalling and the rate of protein translation. Knockdowns were induced in hNPCs and Drosophila melanogaster using RNA interference (RNAi). Transcriptomic profiling of hNPCs was performed using microarrays, and motility behaviour was assessed in flies using the climbing assay.ResultsExpression of NT5C2 was higher during neurodevelopment, and was neuronally enriched in the adult human cortex. Knockdown in hNPCs affected AMPK signalling, a major nutrient sensing mechanism involved in energy homeostasis, and protein translation. Transcriptional changes implicated in protein translation were observed in knockdown hNPCs, and expression changes to genes related to AMPK signalling and protein translation were confirmed using RT-qPCR. The knockdown in Drosophila was associated with drastic climbing impairment.ConclusionsWe provide an extensive neurobiological characterisation of the psychiatric risk gene NT5C2, describing its previously unknown role on the regulation of AMPK signalling and protein translation in neural stem cells, and its association with Drosophila melanogaster motility behaviour. The transcriptomic effect of the knockdown of the psychiatric disease susceptibility gene NT5C2 was assessed in the human neural stem cell line CTX0E16. The Trilencer 27-mer NT5C2 siRNA kit (SR307908, Origene) was used to knockdown NT5C2 using the siRNA sequences A (n = 3) and B (n = 4), in parallel with a negative scramble control sequence (SR30004, n = 4). Cells were incubated with the siRNA sequences for 72 hours, followed by RNA/protein extraction. RT-qPCR analysis revealed a significant knockdown of NT5C2 in the samples analysed by microarray.

    "text": "hnRNPK knock down in Ewing cell line. Ewing sarcoma is a highly aggressive tumor characterized by a translocation between members of the FET family of RNA binding proteins and one of several ETS transcription factors, with the most common translocation being EWS-FLI1. EWS-FLI1 leads to changes in gene expression through mechanisms that are not completely understood. We performed RNA sequencing analysis on primary pediatric human mesenchymal progenitor cells (pMPCs) expressing EWS-FLI1 in order to identify novel target genes. This analysis identified lnc277 as a previously uncharacterized long non-coding RNA upregulated by EWS-FLI1 in pMPCs. Inhibiting the expression of lnc277 diminished the ability of Ewing sarcoma cell lines to proliferate and form colonies in soft agar whereas inhibiting lnc277 had no effect on other cell types tested. By analyzing gene expression after shRNA knockdown, we found that both EWS-FLI1 and lnc277 repressed many more genes that they induced and that a significant fraction of EWS-FLI1 repressed targets were also repressed by lnc277. Analysis of primary human Ewing sarcoma RNA sequencing data further supports a role for lnc277 in mediating gene repression. We identified hnRNPK as an RNA binding protein that interacts directly with lnc277. We found a significant overlap in the genes repressed by hnRNPK and those repressed by both EWS-FLI1 and lnc277, suggesting that hnRNPK participates in lnc277 mediated gene repression. Thus, lnc277 is a previously uncharacterized long non-coding RNA downstream of EWS-FLI1 that facilitates the development of Ewing sarcoma via the repression of target genes. Our studies identify a novel mechanism of oncogenesis downstream of a chromosomal translocation and underscore the importance of lncRNA-mediated gene repression as a mechanism of EWS-FLI1 transcriptional regulation. A673 Ewing cells expressing an shRNA targeting hnRNPK or control were subjected to paired end RNA sequencing and compared to shGFP control.",

    "text": "Radiation and Dual Checkpoint Blockade Activates Non-Redundant Mechanisms in Cancer. Response to immune checkpoint inhibitors may be improved through combinations with each other and other therapies, raising questions about non-redundancy and resistance. We report results from parallel studies of melanoma patients and mice treated with anti-CTLA4 and radiation (RT). Although combined treatment improved responses, resistance was common. Computational analyses of immune and transcriptomic profiles (provided here) revealed that resistance in mice was due to upregulation of tumor PD-L1 that drives T cell exhaustion. Accordingly, optimal response requires RT, anti-CTLA4, and anti-PD-L1. Anti-CTLA4 inhibits Tregs, RT diversifies and shapes the TCR repertoire, and anti-PD-L1 reinvigorates exhausted T cells. Together, all three therapies promote the expansion of clonotypes with distinct TCR traits. Similar to mice, patients with melanoma showing high PD-L1 did not respond to RT + anti-CTLA4, demonstrated persistent T cell exhaustion, and rapidly progressed. Thus, the combination of RT, anti-CTLA4, and anti-PD-L1 promotes response through distinct mechanisms. Mice with bilateral flank B16-F10 tumors were treated with radiation to one tumor combinated with CTLA4 blockade. From unirradiated tumors that were resistant or relapsed after therapy, cell lines were isolated. After confirming the resistance phenotype by reimplantation, tumors from these resistant cells and control sensitive cells were profiled by microarray.",

However, comprehensive studies in AML of children and adolescents are missing so far. We investigated the miRNA expression profiles of different AML subtypes from 102 pediatric patients in comparison to CD34+ cells from healthy donors and adult AML patients, in order to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. Pediatric samples with core factor binding acute myeloid leukemia and promyelocytic leukemia could be distinguished from each other and MLL rearranged AML subtypes by 9 and 18 miRNAs, respectively. miR-126, -146a, -181a/b, -100, and miR-125b were identified as highest differentially expressed with marked difference of expression between pediatric and adulthood samples of the same cytogenetic subgroup. We next isolated the miRNA targeting complex from t(8;21) and t(15;17) cell line models and comprehensively identified bound miRNAs and targeted mRNAs by a newly devised immunoprecipitation assay followed by rapid microarray detection.

Nucleoporins are major constituents of nuclear pore complexes, molecular conglomerates embedded within the nuclear envelope that participate in bidirectional trafficking between nucleus and cytoplasm, chromatin silencing and organization, and transcriptional regulation . This functional vantage point is of utmost importance for fundamental cell processes such as intracellular signaling, cell migration, DNA repair and cell division, all of which can be impaired when the molecular identity of the NE and nuclear pore complex is compromised, as seen in cancer. Here we identify a nucleoporin POM121 as a key regulator of proliferation, tumourigenesis, and survival in chemoresistant prostate cancer. Mechanistically, POM121 regulates nuclear transport of specific survival-conferring transcription factors (MYC and E2F1) and androgen receptor that have been previously linked with advanced stages of prostate cancer. POM121-mediated deregulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport occurs through its interaction with Importin b, which serves as a pharmacological target that decreases tumour growth, sensitizes the tumor cells to standard chemotherapy, and improves survival of patient-derived xenograft mice. These results indicate that nuclear pore complex represents a novel mechanism of chemoresistance, which can be therapeutically targetable in aggressive prostate cancer.

    "text": "Tracing information flow from Erk to target gene induction reveals mechanisms of dynamic and combinatorial control. In prior work we developed an optogenetic system for delivering highly precise, time-varying inputs to Ras, termed OptoSOS (Toettcher et al., 2013). This system relies on a membrane-targeted photoswitchable protein (Phy-CAAX) and a cytoplasmic Ras activator (PIF-SOScat) whose localization to the membrane can be controlled with light. In this system, Phy/PIF heterodimerization can be triggered on and off by exposure to 650 and 750 nm light, respectively. We found that this system could be used to deliver highly precise levels and dynamics of Ras/Erk signaling both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we aimed to globally assess the transcriptional response to light-activated Ras and compare it to that induced by growth factor stimulation. We stimulated NIH3T3 OptoSOS cells with either constant activating red light or PDGF and measured transcriptional responses by RNAseq. Total mRNA was collected after 0, 30, 60 and 120 minutes and used to track the dynamics of transcript abundance in both conditions. Genes were defined as upregulated if they satisfied two criteria: (i) induced at least three-fold over unstimulated cells, and (ii) induced at least two consecutive timepoints. By these criteria we detected 118 genes that were upregulated within 2 h by either PDGF or light stimulation, a comparable number of Ras-responsive genes to that found in previous studies. We found that both PDGF and light induced nearly identical profiles of gene expression, with 100/118 genes induced by PDGF and 110/118 induced by light. At each time point we found excellent agreement between the levels of gene induction in response to both stimuli. This agreement also extended to response dynamics. where hierarchical clustering revealed three classes of dynamic response: an early response peaking within 30 min, an intermediate response peaking at ~1 h, and a late response where gene expression gradually increased over the full 2 h timecourse. In all three classes, we found that light and PDGF led to highly similar expression changes over time. We thus concluded that sole stimulation of the Ras/Erk pathway by light was sufficient to recapitulate at least the first two hours of the PDGF-induced transcriptional response. RNA-seq to measure global transcript abundance at various timepoints after PDGF stimulation or direct optogenetic activation of Ras using the OptoSOS system in NIH3T3 cells (Toettcher et al, Cell 2013). 9 samples were collected using the TruSeq library preparation kit (Illumina), multiplexed, pooled and measured in 3 lanes of an Illumina Hi-Seq 2000. Library quality was assessed by Agilent Bioanalyzer. Roughly 30-50 million reads were measured per sample across all 3 lanes. Baseline transcript abundance was measured in triplicate (0 min controls) and each successive timepoint was measured in a single collection. Genes were considered upregulated if they were induced at least 5-fold in at least two consecutive timepoints relative to their baseline abundance.",

Proteinuria is the most important predictor of outcome in glomerulonephritis and experimental data suggest that the tubular cell response to proteinuria is an important determinant of progressive fibrosis in the kidney. However, it is unclear whether proteinuria is a marker of disease severity or has a direct effect on tubular cells in the kidneys of patients with glomerulonephritis. Accordingly we studied an in vitro model of proteinuria, and identified 231 albumin-regulated genes differentially expressed by primary human kidney tubular epithelial cells exposed to albumin. We translated these findings to human disease by studying mRNA levels of these genes in the tubulo-interstitial compartment of kidney biopsies from patients with IgA nephropathy using microarrays. Biopsies from patients with IgAN (n=25) could be distinguished from those of control subjects (n=6) based solely upon the expression of these 231 albumin-regulated genes. The expression of an 11-transcript subset related to the degree of proteinuria, and this 11-mRNA subset was also sufficient to distinguish biopsies of subjects with IgAN from control biopsies. We tested if these findings could be extrapolated to other proteinuric diseases beyond IgAN and found that the all forms of primary glomerulonephritis (n=33) can be distinguished from controls (n=21) based solely on the expression levels of these 11 genes derived from our in vitro proteinuria model. Pathway analysis suggests common regulatory elements shared by these 11 transcripts. In conclusion, we have identified an albumin-regulated 11-gene signature shared between all forms of primary glomerulonephritis.

To date, most transcriptomics efforts to solve this problem have applied Support Vector Machine techniques to data derived from in vivo studies in rats.Results: We applied a toxicogenomics approach to determine whether known renal toxicants could be identified as such from their effects on the transcriptome of the human renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line, HK-2. Based on clustering of differentially expressed genes, we identified 3 toxicity groups within the set of compounds. We used Random Forest to generate a classifier to accurately place compounds in groups. The classifier is based on a signature biomarker comprising 21 genes identified by Random Forest and could differentiate between the groups with high accuracy. Furthermore, we could correctly classify external samples from a dataset exhibiting a marked 'batch effect'.Conclusions: No toxicity-associated gene expression alterations could be identified across a set of toxic compounds. Random Forest is a suitable technique for the classification of compounds into toxicity groups. Using a measure of differential expression rather than expression level per se generates a robust classifier that can potentially be applied in a platform-independent manner. Gene expression changes in HK-2 cells were measured following exposure to 9 different compounds over a range of doses and time-points with the aim of finding biological signatures of toxicity. Clustering of the resulting gene expression data revealed 3 groups of nephrotoxic compounds (Tox 1, Tox 2 and Tox 3), each exhibiting their own distinct effect on HK-2 cells.This study measures gene expression changes following exposure to high doses of Nnm or a control over 24 hrs or 48 hrs. Three biological replicates per compound/time-point.",

New findings demonstrate that transcriptional factors alternative to Smad4 can bind to Smad2/3 and mediate different transcriptional effects. In this study, we detected constitutively phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in Smad4-null pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC-3. Both pan-specific TGF-b-neutralizing antibody and specific TGF-b type I receptor (TbR-I) inhibitor, SB-431542, can decrease steady-state p-Smad2/3 levels. Moreover, exogenous TGF-b strongly stimulated translocation of phosphorylated Smad2/3 (p-Smad2/3) into the nucleus. Therefore, we identified TGF-b-responsive genes using genome-wide oligonucleotide microarrays and confirmed their dependency on Smad2/3 by the combination of RNA interference (RNAi) and microarray assay. The major finding from our microarray analysis was that of the 262 target genes seen to be regulated via TGF-b induction, 87 were differentially transcriptionally controlled by Smad2/3 signaling and 175 were Smad2/3-independent. Our results showed that integrin b6 was transcriptionally up-regulated via TGF-b induction in a Smad3-dependent manner, which was validated by real-time RT-PCR and western blot. We also provide evidence that aVb6 integrin can activate TGF-b-Smad2/3 signaling. Thus, we for the first time suggest the positive feedback loop compose of TGF-b-Smad3 signaling and integrin b6. Functional analysis revealed that exogenous TGF-b can amplify the invasive property of Smad4-deficient pancreatic cancer cells; however, TGF-b-neutralizing antibody, specific TbR-I inhibitor, and anti-aVb6 integrin antibody can reduce it. Therefore, integrin b6 mediated the invasion of BxPC-3 cells induced by TGF-b signaling.Keywords: cell type comparison. Large-scale microarray analysis was employed for comparison between the responses of wild-type BxPC-3 cell line and each knockdown cell line, with and without TGF-b induction, to identify target genes.",

UBE2O is localized in the 17q25 locus, which is known to be amplified in human cancers, but its role in tumorigenesis remains undefined. Here we show that Ube2o deletion in MMTV-PyVT or TRAMP mice profoundly impairs tumor initiation, growth and metastasis, while switching off the metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells. Mechanistically, UBE2O specifically targets AMPKa2 for ubiquitination and degradation, and thereby promotes activation of the mTOR-HIF1a pathway. Notably, inactivation of AMPKa2, but not AMPKa1, abrogates the tumor attenuation caused by UBE2O-loss, while treatment with rapamycin or inhibition of HIF1a ablates UBE2O-dependent tumor biology. Finally, pharmacological blockade of UBE2O inhibits tumorigenesis through the restoration of AMPKa2, suggesting the UBE2O-AMPKa2 axis as a potential cancer therapeutic target. In order to elucidate the pathophysiological impact of UBE2O loss, we generated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), derived from day 13.5 embryos of C57BL6 mice, stably expressing control or Ube2o shRNA. We then performed microarray analysis in these cells. Three independent MEFs from each shRNA were analyzed.

The thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRb), a key regulator of cellular growth and differentiation, is frequently dysregulated in cancers. Diminished expression of TRb is noted in thyroid, breast, and other solid tumors and is correlated with more aggressive disease. Restoration of TRb levels decreased tumor growth supporting the concept that TRb could function as a tumor suppressor. Yet, the TRb tumor suppression transcriptome is not well delineated and the impact of TRb is unknown in aggressive anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). Here, we establish that restoration of TRb expression in the human ATC cell line SW1736 (SW-TRb) reduces the aggressive phenotype, decreases cancer stem-cell populations and induces cell death in a T3-dependent manner. Transcriptomic analysis of SW-TRb cells via RNA-sequencing revealed distinctive expression patterns induced by ligand-bound TRb and revealed novel molecular signaling pathways. Of note, liganded TRb repressed multiple nodes in the PI3K/AKT pathway, induced expression of thyroid differentiation markers, and promoted pro-apoptotic pathways. Our results further revealed the JAK1-STAT1 pathway as a novel, T3-mediated, anti-tumorigenic pathway that can be activated in additional ATC lines. These findings elucidate a TRb-driven tumor suppression transcriptomic signature, highlight unexplored therapeutic options for ATC, and support TRb activation as a promising therapeutic option in cancers.

To determine how these factors induce this change in cell identity, we carried out genomewide promoter analysis of their binding in iPS and partially reprogrammed cells. Most targets in iPS cells are shared with ES cells and the factors cooperate to activate the ES-like expression program. In partially reprogrammed cells, genes bound by c-Myc have achieved a more ES-like binding and expression pattern. In contrast, genes that are co-bound by Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 in ES cells and that encode pluripotency regulators show severe lack of both binding and transcriptional activation.

    "text": "Downregulation of Human Melanotransferrin on SK-Mel-28 Cell Line. Melanoma tumor antigen p97 or melanotransferrin (MTf) is an iron (Fe)-binding protein with high homology to serum transferrin. MTf is expressed at very low levels in normal tissues and in high amounts in melanoma cells. The over-expression of MTf in tumor cells was hypothesized to assist rapidly proliferating neoplastic cells with their increased Fe requirements. However, our recent characterization of the MTf knockout (MTf -/-) mouse demonstrated that MTf did not have an essential role in Fe metabolism. To understand the function of MTf, we utilized whole-genome microarray analysis to examine the gene expression profile of five models after modulating MTf expression. These models included two new stably transfected MTf hyper-expression models (SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma and LMTK- fibroblasts) and one cell type (SK-Mel-28 melanoma) where MTf was down-regulated by post-transcriptional gene silencing. These findings were compared to alterations in gene expression identified using the MTf -/- mouse. In addition, the changes identified from the gene array data were also assessed in a new model of MTf down-regulation in SK-Mel-2 melanoma cells. In the cell line models, MTf hyper-expression led to increased cellular proliferation, while MTf down-regulation resulted in decreased proliferation. Across all five models of MTf down- and up-regulation, we identified three genes modulated by MTf expression. These included ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 5 (Abcb5), whose change in expression mirrored MTf down- or up-regulation. In addition, thiamine triphosphatase (Thtpa) and transcription factor 4 (Tcf4) were inversely expressed relative to MTf levels across all five models. The products of these three genes are involved in membrane transport, thiamine phosphorylation and cell proliferation/survival, respectively. This study identifies novel molecular targets directly or indirectly regulated by MTf and potential pathways involved in its function. These molecular targets could be involved, at least in part, to the role of MTf in modulating proliferation.Keywords: Melanotransferrin, siRNA, comparative genomic hybridization. To prepare a construct capable of generating hairpin siRNA specific for human MTf mRNA, the expression vector, pSilencer(tm) 3.1-H1 neo (Ambion, Texas, USA) was used. The vector was used to clone transgene of 66-bp that transcribe 19-mer double-stranded hairpin RNAs of the target gene. The transgene were specifically targeted to positions 2031-2049-bp in the MTf gene (Genbank Accession: NM_005929). Transfections of pS-MTf transgenes or pS-scrambled vectors into human SK-Mel-28 melanoma cells were performed with LipofectamineTM 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Melbourne, Australia). Total RNA was isolated from the cells using TRIzol Reagent(r) (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA from the stably-transfected SK-Mel-28 melanoma cell lines were prepared and hybridized onto Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. The human GeneChip(r) U133 Plus 2.0 consists of greater than 47,000 transcripts and variants from over 38,500 well characterized human genes (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).",

The poor clinical outcome in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has been attributed to intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy and a growth-permissive tumor microenvironment. Quiescent pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are neuroendocrine, nestin-positive, lipid-accumulating cells whose homologues in the liver are the principal repository of Vitamin A esters. Upon activation, lipid droplets are lost and via transdifferentiation they become the key cell type responsible for driving the severe desmoplasia that characterizes PDA. Despite their critical role in PDA progression and chemoresistance, therapeutic strategies targeting PSCs are lacking. Here we identified the vitamin D receptor (VDR) as a master genomic regulator of PSC activation and function. In vitro we demonstrate that VDR activation reduces expression in PSCs of genes implicated in activation, inflammation, and extracellular matrix production, as well as restoring lipid droplet integrity. In vivo, the VDR ligand calcipotriol enhances the anti-tumor effects of gemcitabine by increasing intratumoral concentration 5-fold, reducing tumor volume to near baseline and lowering metastases by more than 65%. These findings implicate VDR as a master regulator of PSC activation and identify a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. RNA-Seq analyses was used to characterize cancer-associated changes between pre-activated (3-day culture) and activated (7-day culture) primary mouse PSCs, as well as control and PDA human PSCs. RNA-Seq was also used to assess the impact of VDR activation (DMSO vs calcipotriol) in a human PSC line (MiaPaCa-2), the mouse primary PSCs.",

DNA damage activates a complex signaling network in cells that blocks cell cycle progression, recruits factors involved in DNA repair, and/or triggers programs that control senescence or programmed cell death. Alterations in chromatin structure are known to be important for the initiation and propagation of the DNA damage response, although the molecular details are unclear. We investigated the role of chromatin structure in the DNA damage response by monitoring multiple timedependent checkpoint signaling and response events with a high-content multiplex image-based RNAi screen of chromatin modifying and interacting genes. We discovered that Brd4, a double bromodomain-containing protein, functions as an endogenous inhibitor of DNA damage signaling by binding to acetylated histones at sites of open chromatin and altering chromatin accessibility. Loss of Brd4 or disruption of acetyl-lysine binding results in an increase in both the number and size of radiation-induced !H2AX nuclear foci while overexpression of a Brd4 splice isoform completely suppresses !H2AX formation, despite equivalent double strand break formation. Brd4 knock-down cells displayed altered chromatin structure, prolonged cell cycle checkpoint arrest and enhanced survival after irradiation, while overexpression of Brd4 isoform B results in enhanced radiationinduced lethality. Brd4 is the target of the t(15;19) chromosomal translocation in a rare form of cancer, NUT Midline Carcinoma. Acetyl lysine-bromodomain interactions of the Brd4-NUT fusion protein suppresses !H2AX foci in discrete nuclear compartments, rendering cells more radiosensitive, mimicking overexpression of Brd4 isoform B. NUT Midline Carcinoma is sensitive to radiotherapy, however tumor material from this rare cancer is scarce. We therefore investigated Brd4 expression in another human cancer commonly treated with radiotherapy, glioblastoma multiforme, and found that expression of Brd4 isoform B correlated specifically with treatment response to radiotherapy. These data implicate Brd4 as an endogenous insulator of DNA damage signaling through recognition of epigenetic modifications in chromatin and suggest that expression of the Brd4 in human cancer can modulate the clinical response to DNA-damaging cancer therapy.

Tissue-resident macrophages have an embryonic origin, but are replenished under steady state conditions in some tissues by blood monocytes that can adopt genotypic and phenotypic features of the residents. However, little is known about the residency and functional properties of infiltrating macrophages after an inflammatory challenge. The meninges of the central nervous system (CNS) are populated by a dense network of specialized macrophages that act as resident immune sentinels. Here we show that following lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection resident meningeal macrophages become activated by innate inflammatory cytokines, acquire viral antigen, and interact directly with infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), which leads to their depletion. Concurrently, the meninges are heavily infiltrated by peripherally-derived inflammatory monocytes that engraft the meningeal niche and remain in situ for months after viral clearance. This engraftment leads to phenotypic and functional changes in the pool of resident meningeal macrophages that depends in part on IFNg signaling. These changes include loss of bacterial and immunoregulatory sensors that impede subsequent CNS immune reactions. Collectively, these data indicate that peripheral monocytes can engraft the meninges after an inflammatory challenge, imprinting the compartment with long-term defects in immune function. .

Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a very extensively studied prototypical polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Previous work in our laboratory showed no changes of microRNA (miRNA) expression in liver following a 3 days exposure to BaP, suggesting a lack of miRNA transcriptional responses to aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonists and/or DNA damage. Here, we studied 25-week old male MutaTM Mouse exposed to 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg/day BaP by oral gavage for 28 consecutive days. MAANOVA identified 110 differentially expressed genes (adjusted p < 0.05) with fold change greater than 1.5. The genes most affected included those involved in xenobiotic metabolism, phase II metabolizing enzymes, as well as the downstream targets of p53. Pathway specific RT-PCR was used to confirm the p53 response. A single significant increase in miRNA expression was identified (mir-34a and validated using the Qiagen miScript PCR system). This miRNA is known to be transcriptionally activated by p53. Ingestion of BaP leads to widespread changes in gene expression in mouse liver, with enrichment of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA damage response, and apoptosis via the p53 pathway. In contrast, miRNA expression was relatively unaffected. Only miR-34a was significantly up-regulated, and may therefore play a critical role in the post-transcriptional regulation of p53 and/or its downstream targets.Keywords: Agilent mouse 4 x 44 oligonucleotide microarrays were used to assess global gene expression in response to 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg BaP treatment.

Macrophages play a key role in both innate and adaptive immunity, but our knowledge on the changes in transcription regulation that occurs during their differentiation from monocytes is still limited. In this study, we used a meta-analysis followed by a systems biology approach for the identification of differentially expressed genes between monocytes and macrophages and possible regulators of these changes in transcription. Based on the pattern of gene expression change, transcription regulator analysis predicted a decrease in Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone 3 lysine 27 methyl transferase, activity after differentiation of monocytes into macrophages. This inhibition was validated by a significant decrease in trimethylated H3K27 during differentiation of both human primary monocytes into macrophages and the THP-1 cell line into macrophage-like cells. Overexpressing EZH2 during differentiation of monocytes and THP-1 cells obstructs cellular adhesion, thus preventing the first step in differentiation. Another facet of macrophage differentiation is the cessation of proliferation, and inhibition of EZH2 by the small molecule inhibitor GSK126 in THP-1 cells indeed impedes proliferation. This study shows an important part for epigenetic changes during monocyte differentiation.

A strong host genetic contribution to leprosy susceptibility is well established. However, the modulation of the transcriptional response to infection and the mechanism(s) of disease control are poorly understood. To address this gap in knowledge of leprosy pathogenicity, we conducted a genome-wide search for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) that are associated with transcript variation -- before and after stimulation with M. leprae sonicate in whole blood cells. We show that M. leprae antigen stimulation mainly triggered the upregulation of immune related genes and that a substantial proportion of the differential gene expression is genetically controlled. Indeed, using stringent criteria, we identified 318 genes displaying cis-eQTL at an FDR of 0.01, including 66 genes displaying response-eQTL (reQTL), i.e. cis-eQTL that showed significant evidence for interaction with the M. leprae stimulus. Such reQTL correspond to regulatory variations that affect the interaction between human whole blood cells and M. leprae sonicate, and thus likely between the human host and M. leprae bacilli. We found that reQTL are significantly enriched among binding sites of transcription factors that are activated in response to infection, and that they were enriched among single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with susceptibility to leprosy per se and Type-I Reaction, as well as SNPs targeted by recent positive selection. Our study suggests that natural selection shaped our genomic diversity to face pathogen exposure including M. leprae infection. 51 unrelated individuals from Vietnam diagnosed with borderline leprosy were recruited.

Since E3 ubiquitin ligase proteins regulate carcinogenesis through the timely control of many cellular processes such as DNA damage response, metabolism, transcription, and apoptosis, we reasoned that TRIM8 activity might impact on cell transcriptome patterns, thereby promoting cancer development and progression. Therefore, we profiled the whole transcriptome of normal embryonic neural stem cells (eNSC) infected with a retrovirus expressing FLAG-Trim8 by using RNA-Seq.

We now show that the pro-differentiation transcription factor Grainyhead-like 3 (GRHL3), essential during epidermal development but dispensable in adult skin homeostasis, is required for barrier repair after adult epidermal injury. Consistent with activation of a GRHL3-regulated repair pathway in psoriasis, we find GRHL3 up-regulation in lesional skin where GRHL3 binds known epidermal differentiation gene targets. Furthermore, we show the functionality of this pathway in the Imiquimod mouse model of immune-mediated epidermal hyperplasia where loss of Grhl3 exacerbates the epidermal damage response, conferring greater sensitivity to disease induction, delayed resolution of epidermal lesions, and resistance to anti-IL-22 therapy. ChIP-seq and gene expression profiling studies show that while GRHL3 regulates differentiation genes both in development and during repair from immune-mediated damage, it targets distinct sets of genes in the two processes. In particular, GRHL3 suppresses a number of alarmin and other pro-inflammatory genes after immune injury. This study identifies a GRHL3-regulated epidermal barrier repair pathway that suppresses disease initiation and helps resolve existing lesions in immune-mediated epidermal hyperplasia.

We mated mice with floxed alleles of both Apc and Pten, to mice with floxed alleles for Arid1a, to obtain female mice with both copies of all three genes floxed. At 7 to 8 weeks of age the right ovarian bursal cavites of the mice were injected with 50 million plaque-forming units of adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase, which causes the floxed genes to be knocked out. Tumor tissue from 3 mice for each group was obtained at necropsy, RNA purified, and targets for Affymetrix arrays synthesized from the mRNAs. We used Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays, which hold 45101 probe-sets. Raw data was processed with Robust Multi-array Average algorithm (RMA). Data is log2-transformed transcript abundance estimates. We performed T-tests to compare the 3 vs 3 arrays. We supply a supplementary excel workbook that holds the same data as the data matrix file, but also holds the probe-set annotation at the time we analyzed the data, and some very simple statistical calculations, which select subsets of the probe-sets as differentially expressed. Consumers should consider obtaining more up-to-date probe-set annotation for the array platform. We have also supplied a second supplementary tar archive holding software and files to 1) perform permutation testing of the probe-set selection in order to estimate false discovery rates for the probe-sets we selected as differentially expressed, 2) perform enrichment testing of GO terms, and 3) to perform enrichment testing of KEGG pathways and 3000 curated gene sets from version 4 of the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB).

Dendritic cell activation through ligation of pattern recognition receptors leading to full functional maturation causes induction of CD8 T cell immunity instead of tolerance through increased delivery of co-stimulatory signals. Here we investigate whether a prototypic organ-resident antigen-presenting cells, i.e. liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC), also switch from tolerogenic to immunogenic CD8 T cell activation upon such activation. We demonstrate by gene expression analysis that LSEC expressed numerous pattern recognition receptors that attributed sentinel function, but ligand-induced activation of these receptors was not sufficient to overcome tolerance induction of CD8 T cells. However, viral infection caused functional maturation of antigen-presenting LSEC and was sufficient to promote antigen-specific differentiation into fully functional effector CD8 T cells in the absence of dendritic cells. Thus, we identify a novel principle of inducing CD8 T cell immunity by virally infected organ-resident antigen-presenting cells employing distinct mechanisms compared to dendritic cells. Transcriptional profiles of untreated liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) and LSEC, stimulated with either LPS (100ng/ml) or infected with MCMV-GFP (MOI=0.1) were compared on Illumina Mouse WG-6 BeadChip microarray platform.

    "text": "Coenzyme Q10-dependent gene expression in SAMP1 mice tissues. Our present study reveals significant decelerating effects on senescence processes in middle-aged SAMP1 mice supplemented for 6 or 14 months with the reduced form (QH2, 500 mg/ kg BW/ day) of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). To unravel molecular mechanisms of these CoQ10 effects, a genome-wide transcript profiling in liver, heart, brain and kidney of SAMP1 mice supplemented with the reduced (QH2) or oxidized form of CoQ10 (Q10) was performed. Liver seems to be the main target tissue of CoQ10 intervention, followed by kidney, heart and brain. Stringent evaluation of the resulting data revealed that QH2 has a stronger impact on gene expression than Q10, which was primarily due to differences in the bioavailability. Indeed, we found that QH2 supplementation was more effective than Q10 to increase levels of CoQ10 in the liver of SAMP1 mice (54.92-fold and 30.36-fold, respectively). To identify functional and regulatory connections of the \"top 50\" (p < 0.05) up- and down-regulated QH2-sensitive transcripts in liver (fold changes ranging from 21.24 to -6.12), text mining analysis (Genomatix BiblioSphere, GFG level B3) was used. Hereby, we identified 11 QH2-sensitive genes which are regulated by PPAR-a and are primarily involved in cholesterol synthesis (e.g. HMGCS1, HMGCL, HMGCR), fat assimilation (FABP5), lipoprotein metabolism (PLTP) and inflammation (STAT-1). Thus, we provide evidence that QH2 is involved in the reduction of fat and cholesterol synthesis via modulation of the PPAR-a signalling pathway. These data may explain, at least in part, the observed effects on decelerated age-dependent degeneration processes in QH2-supplemented SAMP1 mice. Whole genome expression profiles were analysed from liver, heart, brain and kidney (each analyzed separately) of SAMP1 mice supplemented with QH2, Q10 or a control diet. From every experimental group, three mice each were sacrificed 6 or 14 months after supplementation, resulting in a total of 72 microarrays.",

Tetracycline-based inducible systems provide powerful methods for functional studies where gene expression can be controlled. However, the lack of tight control of the inducible system, leading to leakiness and adverse effects caused by undesirable tetracycline dosage requirements, has proven to be a limitation. Here we report that the combined use of genome editing tools and last generation Tet-On systems can resolve these issues. Our principle is based on precise integration of inducible transcriptional elements (coined PrIITE) targeted to; 1) exons of an endogenous gene of interest (GOI) and 2) a safe harbor locus. Using PrIITE cells harboring a GFP reporter or CDX2 transcription factor, we demonstrate discrete inducibility of gene expression with complete abrogation of leakiness. CDX2 PrIITE cells generated by this approach uncovered novel CDX2 downstream effector genes.

Objective: Although glucagon-secreting a-cells and insulin-secreting b-cells have opposing functions in regulating plasma glucose levels, the two cell types share a common developmental origin and have overlaps in their transcriptome and epigenome profiles. Notably, destruction of one of these cell populations can stimulate repopulation via transdifferentiation of the other cell type, at least in mice, suggesting plasticity between these cell fates. Furthermore, dysfunction of both a- and b-cells contributes to the pathophysiology of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and b-cell de-differentiation has been proposed to contribute to type 2 diabetes. Our objective was to delineate the molecular properties that maintain islet cell type specification yet allow for cellular plasticity. We hypothesized that correlating cell type-specific transcriptomes with an atlas of open chromatin will identify novel genes and transcriptional regulatory elements such as enhancers involved in a- and b-cell specification and plasticity.Methods: We sorted human a- and b-cells and performed the \"Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high throughput sequencing\" (ATAC-seq) and mRNA-seq, followed by integrative analysis to identify cell type-selective gene regulatory regions.Results: We identified numerous transcripts with either a-cell- or b-cell-selective expression and discovered the cell type-selective open chromatin regions that correlate with these gene activation patterns. We confirmed cell type-selective expression on the protein level for two of the top hits from our screen. The \"group specific protein\" (GC; or vitamin D binding protein) was restricted to a-cells, while CHODL (chondrolectin) immunoreactivity was only present in b-cells. Furthermore, a-cell- and b-cell-selective ATAC-seq peaks were identified to overlap with known binding sites for islet transcription factors, as well as with common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously identified as risk loci for type 2 diabetes.Conclusions: We have determined the genetic landscape of human a- and b-cells based on chromatin accessibility and transcript levels, which allowed for detection of novel a- and b-cell signature genes not previously known to be expressed in islets. Using fine-mapping of open chromatin, we have identified thousands of potential cis-regulatory elements that operate in an endocrine cell type-specific fashion.

    "text": "Vitamin C induces Tet-dependent DNA demethylation in ES cells to promote a blastocyst-like methylome [Affymetrix]. DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic modification involved in gene silencing, imprinting, and the suppression of retrotransposons. Global DNA demethylation occurs in the early embryo and the germline and may be mediated by Tet (ten-eleven-translocation) enzymes, which convert 5-methylcytosine (mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC). Tet enzymes have been extensively studied in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, which are generally cultured in the absence of Vitamin C, a potential co-factor for Fe(II) 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase enzymes like Tets. Here we report that addition of Vitamin C to ES cells promotes Tet activity leading to a rapid and global increase in hmC. This is followed by DNA demethylation of numerous gene promoters and up-regulation of demethylated germline genes. Tet1 binding is enriched near the transcription start site (TSS) of genes affected by Vitamin C treatment. Importantly, Vitamin C, but not other antioxidants, enhances the activity of recombinant human Tet1 in a biochemical assay and the Vitamin C-induced changes in hmC and mC are entirely suppressed in Tet1/2 double knockout (Tet DKO) ES cells. Vitamin C has the strongest effects on regions that gain methylation in cultured ES cells compared to blastocysts and in vivo are methylated only after implantation. In contrast, imprinted regions and intracisternal A-particle (IAP) elements, which are resistant to demethylation in the early embryo, are resistant to Vitamin C-induced DNA demethylation. Collectively, this study establishes that Vitamin C is a direct regulator of Tet activity and DNA methylation fidelity in ES cells. Oct4-GiP mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were cultured in the presence or absence of Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, 200 mg/ml) for 72 hours. RNA was harvested from biological triplicates for each condition and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.

The same SNPs were previously associated with mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and susceptibility to severe malaria infection. We showed that Atp2b4-/- mice demonstrate increased MCHC, confirming ATP2B4 as the causal gene at this GWAS locus.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We profiled peripheral blood (PB) monocyte gene expression in 6 healthy subjects and 16 children with type 1 diabetes diagnosed ~3 months previously, and analyzed clinical features from diagnosis to 1 year. RESULTS: Monocyte expression profiles clustered into two distinct subgroups, representing mild and severe deviation from healthy controls, along the same continuum. Patients with strongly divergent monocyte gene expression had significantly higher insulin dose-adjusted HbA1c levels during the first year, compared to patients with mild deviation. The diabetes-associated expression signature identified multiple perturbations in pathways controlling cellular metabolism and survival, including endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress (e.g. induction of HIF1A, DDIT3, DDIT4 and GRP78). qPCR quantitation of a 9-gene panel correlated with glycaemic control in 12 additional recent-onset patients. The qPCR signature was also detected in PB from healthy first-degree relatives. CONCLUSIONS: A PB gene expression signature correlates with glycaemic control in the first year after diabetes diagnosis, and is present in at-risk subjects. These findings implicate monocyte phenotype as a candidate biomarker for disease progression pre- and post-onset, and systemic stresses as contributors to innate immune function in type 1 diabetes.

We found that AZD1775 resistant cell lines are dependent upon increased HDAC activity for their survival, in part due to increased KDM5A activity. In addition, gene expression analyses demonstrate HDAC dependent increase in MYC expression and c-MYC activity in AZD1775 treated resistant cells. Overexpression of c-MYC confers resistance to AZD1775 in cell lines with low base line expression. Pharmacologic inhibition of BRD4, and thereby c-MYC, partially abrogated resistance to AZD1775. Thus, acquired resistance to WEE1 inhibition may be reversed by HDAC or BRD4 inhibition in leukemia cells. AZD1775-sensitive and -resistant Jurkat, Molm13 and REH cells were treated with panobinostat and/or AZD1775 for 24 hr. RNA was isolated, and processed for sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform.",

Despite substantial self-renewal capability in vivo, epithelial stem and progenitor cells located in various tissues expand for a few passages in vitro in feeder-free condition before they succumb to growth arrest. Here we describe the EpiX(tm) method that utilizes small molecules that inhibit PAK1-ROCK-Myosin II and TGF-b signaling to achieve over one trillion-fold expansion of human epithelial stem and progenitor cells from skin, airway, mammary and prostate glands in the absence of feeder cells. Transcriptomic and epigenomic studies show that this condition helps epithelial cells to overcome stresses for continuous proliferation. EpiX-expanded basal epithelial cells differentiate into mature epithelial cells consistent with their tissue origins. Whole genome sequencing reveals that the cells retain remarkable genome integrity after extensive in vitro expansion without acquiring tumorigenicity. EpiX technology provides a solution to exploit the potential of tissue-resident epithelial stem and progenitor cells for regenerative medicine. mRNA profiles of human foreskin keratinocytes in different culture conditions were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina NextSeq.",

Background: Despite significant improvements in short-term kidney transplant survival, comparable increases in 5 and 10-year outcomes have not been achieved.

We performed a randomized prospective trial comparing calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-free to CNI-based immunosuppression to determine the impact on renal function, structure, and gene expression.Methods: Sixty-one kidney recipients received mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and prednisone (P). Randomized patients received concentration-controlled sirolimus or cyclosporine. Two years post-transplant 55 patients underwent renal function studies, 48 (87%) underwent transplant biopsies; all classified by Banff scoring and 41 by DNA microarrays.Findings: Comparing sirolimus/MMF/P to cyclosporine/MMF/P at two years, there was a significantly lower serum creatinine (1.35 vs. 1.81 mg/dl; p=0.008), significantly higher Cockroft-Gault glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (80.4 vs. 63.4 cc/min; p=0.008), iothalamate GFR (60.6 vs. 49.2 cc/min; p= 0.018), and Banff 0 (normal) biopsies (66.6 vs. 20.8%; p=0.013).

Gene expression profiles of kidney biopsies with higher Banff CAN scores confirmed significant up regulation of genes responsible for immune/inflammation and fibrosis/tissue remodeling.Interpretation: At two years the sirolimus-treated patients have better renal transplant function, a diminished prevalence of CAN, and down regulated expression of genes responsible for the progression of CAN.

The cellular microRNA, miR-155 has been shown to be involved in lymphocyte activation and is expressed in EBV infected cells displaying type III latency gene expression but not type I latency gene expression. We show here that the elevated levels of miR-155 in type III latency cells is due to EBV gene expression and not epigenetic differences in cell lines tested and we show that expression in EBV infected cells requires a conserved AP-1 element in the miR-155 promoter. Gene expression analysis was carried out in a type I latency cell line transduced with a miR-155 expressing retrovirus. This analysis identified both miR-155 suppressed and induced cellular mRNAs and suggested that in addition to direct targeting of 3' UTRs, miR-155 alters gene expression in part through the alteration of signal transduction pathways. 3' UTR reporter analysis of predicted miR-155 target genes identified the transcriptional regulatory genes, BACH1, ZIC3, HIVEP2, CEBPB, ZNF652, ARID2, and SMAD5 as miR-155 targets. Western blot analysis of the most highly suppressed of these, BACH1, showed lower expression in cells transduced with a miR-155 retrovirus. Inspection of the promoters from genes regulated in EBV infected cells and in cells infected with a miR-155 retrovirus identified potential binding sequences for BACH1 and ZIC3.

However, its use is still limited due to the resistance to the initial response. Such resistance could be regulated by various cell types and soluble factors, although the underlying mechanisms, especially cell-based mechanisms, remain incompletely understood. Here, we identified bone marrow-derived fibrocytes as a novel contributor for the acquired resistance to bevacizumab, defined as alpha-1 type I collagen-positive and CXCR4-positive cells. In mouse models of lung cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma, fibrocytes mediated the resistance to bevacizumab as a main producer of fibroblast growth factor 2.

Previously, we have identified cytosolic form of the grainyhead transcription factor 2 gene (GRHL2) as notably hypomethylated in low-malignant potential (LMP) and high-grade (HG) serous epithelial ovarian tumors, compared to normal ovarian tissues. Here we show that GRHL2 is strongly overexpressed in both LMP and HG serous EOC tumors, thus suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms might be implicated in GRHL2 overexpression in serous epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Knockdown of the GRHL2 expression in EOC cells led to sharp decrease of cell proliferation and induced G1-phase cell cycle arrest. Additionally, GRHL2 suppression significantly inhibited EOC cell migration and invasion. Gene expression profiling and consecutive network and pathway analyses confirmed these findings, as numerous genes and pathways known previously to be implicated in ovarian tumorigenesis, including EOC tumor invasion and metastasis, were found to be downregulated upon BCAT1 suppression, while some tumor suppressor genes were induced. Taken together, our data are indicative for a strong oncogenic potential of the GRHL2 gene in advanced EOC and identify this transaminase as a novel EOC biomarker and putative EOC therapeutic target. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of GRHL2 gene action in ovarian cancer cells, we employed the Agilent Whole Human Genome microarrays, containing ~ 44,000 genes to identify global gene expression changes upon GRHL2 suppression in A2780s cells and GRHL2 suppression and overexpression in SKOV3 cells.

Using both diet-induced and genetically modified T2D animal models, we explore immune components of islet inflammation and define their roles in regulating beta cell function and proliferation. Our studies show that T2D-associated islet inflammation is uniquely dominated by macrophages, without the involvement of adaptive immune cells. We identify two islet macrophage populations, characterized by their distinct phenotypes, anatomical distributions and functional properties. Obesity induces a local expansion of intra-islet macrophages, independent of the replenishment from circulating monocytes. In contrast, the abundance of peri-islet macrophages is negligibly affected by obesity. Functionally, intra-islet macrophages impair beta cell function in a cell-cell contact dependent manner. In contrast, both intra- and peri-islet macrophage populations are able to promote beta cell proliferation.

Estrogen receptor a (ERa) is an important biomarker of breast cancer severity and a common therapeutic target. Recent studies have demonstrated that in addition to its role in promoting proliferation, ERa also protects tumors against metastatic transformation. Current therapeutics antagonize ERa and interfere with both beneficial and detrimental signaling pathways stimulated by ERa. The goal of this study is to uncover the dynamics of coding and non-coding RNA (microRNA) expression in response to estrogen stimulation and identify potential therapeutic targets that more specifically inhibit ERa-stimulated growth and survival pathways without interfering with its protective features. To achieve this, we exposed MCF7 cells (an estrogen receptor positive model cell line for breast cancer) to estrogen and prepared a time course of paired mRNA and miRNA sequencing libraries at ten time points throughout the first 24 hours of the response to estrogen. From these data, we identified three primary expression trends--transient, induced, and repressed--that were each enriched for genes with distinct cellular functions. Integrative analysis of paired mRNA and microRNA temporal expression profiles identified miR-503 as the strongest candidate master regulator of the estrogen response, in part through suppression of ZNF217--an oncogene that is frequently amplified in cancer. We confirmed experimentally that miR-503 directly targets ZNF217 and that over-expression of miR-503 suppresses breast cancer cell proliferation. Overall, these data indicate that miR-503 acts as a potent estrogen-induced tumor suppressor microRNA that opposes cellular proliferation and has promise as a therapeutic for breast cancer. More generally, our work provides a systems-level framework for identifying functional interactions that shape the temporal dynamics of gene expression. Quantification of miRNAs in MCF7 cells responding to estrogen following a period of estrogen starvation.Three independent biological replicates (30 samples: 3 replicates x 10 time points) of MCF7 cells were exposed to 10nM Estradiol for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12 , or 24 hours, and total RNA was extracted from the samples.

Based on these observations, we performed the appropriate global analyses to ascertain that SD70 inhibits the androgen-dependent AR program, and prostate cancer cell growth, acting, at least in part, by functionally inhibiting the jumonji (JMJ) domain-containing demethylase, KDM4C. Drug-seq represents a powerful strategy for new drug development by mapping genome-wide location of small molecules, a powerful adjunct to contemporary drug development strategies.

Transcriptional profiling of rat EAC - comparison of non-/pre-malignant endometrium with endometrial tumorsEndometrial cancer develops from the endometrium of the uterus and is the most common pelvic malignancy diagnosed in women in the western countries. Similar to all cancer diseases, endometrial cancer is a genetic disorder that results from complex patterns of genetic and epigenetic alterations involved in the malignant transformation. The genetic heterogeneity inherent in the human population, differences in the environment and life styles poses enormous difficulties when analyzing the complex patterns of genetic alterations contributing to cancer etiology. Inbred animal models constitute unique experimental genetic tools as the genetic heterogeneity and the influence of environmental factors can be readily reduced. The BDII/Han rat model is unique for spontaneous hormonal carcinogenesis since more than 90% of the female virgins spontaneously develop endometrial cancer during their life span. The possibility to perform global gene expression profiling of tumor cells would likely provide important information of the genes and pathways that are involved in EAC susceptibility and carcinogenesis.Keywords: Endometrial tumors developed in crosses with the BDII inbred rat strain (from backcrosses, NUT, and intercrosses, RUT) and Sprague Dawley curley-3 and Brown Norway.

Background: Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are considered responsible for cancer relapse and drug-resistance. Understanding the identity of BCSCs may open new avenues in breast cancer therapy. Although several discoveries have been made on BCSCs characterization, the factors critical to BCSCs is largely unclear. This study was aimed to determine whether genomic mutation contributes to the acquisition of cancer stem-like phenotype, and to investigate the genetic and transcriptional features of BCSCs.Methods: We detected the potential mutation hotspot regions by using whole genome sequencing on parental cancer cells and derived serial-generation spheroids in increasing order of BCSC frequency, and then performed target deep DNA sequencing in the level of bulk-cell and single-cell. To identify the transcriptional program associated with BCSCs, bulk-cell and single-cell RNA sequencing were performed.Results: By analyzing whole genome sequencing of bulk cells, potential BCSCs associated mutation hotspot regions were detected. Validation by target deep sequencing, in both bulk-cell and single-cell levels, revealed no genetic changes specifically associated with BCSC phenotype. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing showed that cancer cells display profound transcriptional variability at the single-cell level that predicts BCSC features. Notably, this transcriptomic variability is enriched in transcription of a number of genes, revealed as BCSC markers. Individuals with breast cancer in a high-risk recurrence group exhibited higher expression of these transcriptomic variabilities, highlighting their clinical significance.Conclusions: Transcriptional variability, not genetic mutations, distinguish BCSCs from non-BCSCs. The identified BCSCs markers can become novel targets for BCSCs. To identify the transcriptional program associated with BCSCs, bulk-cell and single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on both spheroids and cells that cannot give rise to spheroid.",

In leukemogenesis Notch signaling can be up- and down-regulated in a context-dependent manner. Here we report that deletion of hairy and enhancer of split-1 (Hes1) promotes acute myeloid leukemia (AML) development induced by the MLL-AF9 fusion protein. Subsequently, the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) was up-regulated in mouse cells of a Hes1- or RBP-J-null background. MLL-AF9-expressing Hes1-null AML cells showed enhanced proliferation and ERK phosphorylation following FLT3 ligand stimulation. FLT3 inhibition efficiently abrogated proliferation of MLL-AF9-induced Hes1-null AML cells. Furthermore, an agonistic anti-Notch2 antibody induced apoptosis of MLL-AF9-induced AML cells in a Hes1-wild type but not a Hes1-null background. These observations demonstrate that Hes1 mediates tumor suppressive roles of Notch signaling in AML development by down-regulating FLT3 expression. 4 samples are analyzed, two pairs of MLL-AF9/Hes1-/- and MLL-AF9/Hes1+/+ leukemic bone marrows.",

    "text": "Expression Signatures Identify Origin of Primary and Therapeutic Strategies for Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors. Background: Fatal cancer is often the result of spread, or metastasis, of a cancer cell from the site of its origin to a distant anatomic site. While the metastatic process and the foreign environment of the metastatic site impact a tumor's biology, we continue to determine therapy for patients based upon their cancer's site of origin. We have performed an unbiased analysis across metastatic solid tumors from common primary sites to determine the molecular impact of the metastatic process on site-specific biology and to identify novel therapeutic strategies.Methods: Global gene expression was used as a biological phenotype to perform a top-down analysis of 96 metastatic human tumors. Laser capture microdissection, RNA amplification, and microarray analysis were used to measure the transcription patterns of malignant epithelial cells. Genes, multi-gene expression \"signatures\", and pathways associated with site of origin (SOO) and site of metastases (SOM) were identified using established computational approaches. SOO and SOM expression signatures were validated on multiple, independent datasets comprising 1217 samples (1104 samples from GSE2109 (Expression Project for Oncology) and 113 samples from GSE12630 (Monzon FA, Lyons-Weiler M, Buturovic LJ, Rigl CT et al. Multicenter validation of a 1,550-gene expression profile for identification of tumor tissue of origin. J Clin Oncol 2009 May 20;27(15):2503-8. PMID: 19332734). Reverse phase proteomics and in vitro tissue culture were used to validate associations between biological pathways, site of primary, and implicated therapeutic combinations.Findings: SOO has the dominant influence on solid tumor biology as samples segregate based upon their primary site during unsupervised hierarchical clustering. In addition, statistically significant associations are identified between single genes and pathways and each primary site investigated and SOO signatures for colon, breast, ovary, lung, and prostate cancers accurately identify primary site for independent samples of both local and metastatic tumors independent of degree of histological differentiation. The impact of SOM on tumor biology is evident as genes and pathways are significantly associated with metastatic site and SOM signatures can be generated but they are not strongly predictive when applied to localized tumors. Pathway analysis identified relatively increased expression of MYC, beta-catenin, and SRC gene sets in metastatic colorectal cancers which was confirmed with proteomic analysis of a sub-set of the original tumors. Within colorectal cancers, high SRC expression also correlates with predicted oxaliplatin sensitivity and the combination of an SRC inhibitor with oxaliplatin demonstrated synergy in three independent colorectal cancer cell lines.Interpretation: Our findings suggest that the complex alterations required for metastasis do not obscure the impact of a cancer cell's origin. SOO signatures have the potential to be highly accurate diagnostic tools and the underlying site-specific biology can be used to identify novel therapeutic targets for advanced cancers.Keywords: Gene expression analysis.

Transcription factors that bind small DNA motifs embedded in promoters play a central role in controlling gene expression. However, in addition to these elements, up to 70% of genes in higher eukaryotes also have high levels of non-methylated cytosine/guanine base pairs (CpGs) surrounding promoters and gene regulatory units. These features, called CpG islands, were identified over twenty years ago but there remains little mechanistic evidence to suggest how these enigmatic elements contribute to promoter function, with the exception that they are refractory to epigenetic silencing by DNA methylation. Here we show that CpG islands directly recruit the H3K36 specific lysine demethylase enzyme KDM2A. Genome wide analyses by ChIP-seq demonstrated a striking global association of KDM2A with CpG islands. Nucleation of KDM2A at these elements resulted in removal of H3K36 methylation creating CpG island chromatin that is uniquely depleted of this modification. KDM2A utilizes a zinc finger CxxC (ZF-CxxC) domain that specifically recognizes non-methylated CpG DNA and binding is blocked when the CpG DNA is methylated, thus constraining KDM2A to nonmethylated CpG islands. These data expose a remarkably straightforward mechanism through which KDM2A delineates a unique architecture that differentiates CpG island chromatin from bulk chromatin. Two cell lines were used in this study: a control line (LMP) with wildtype levels of KDM2A, and a KDM2A knockdown line (RNAi) in which KDM2A levels were depleted by approximately 60% using an shRNA-based approach. For each cell line, RNA was extracted from cells collected on two different dates (rep1 and rep2).",

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is caused by insufficient epigenetic repression of D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat where DUX4, an FSHD causing gene is embedded. There are two forms of FSHD, FSHD1 with contraction of D4Z4 repeat and FSHD2 with chromatin compaction defects mostly due to SMCHD1 mutation. Previous reports showed DUX4-induced gene expression changes as well as changes in microRNA expression in FSHD muscle cells. However, a genome wide analysis of small noncoding RNAs that might be regulated by DUX4 or by mutations in SMCHD1 has not been reported yet. Here, we identified several types of small noncoding RNAs including known microRNAs that are differentially expressed in FSHD2 muscle cells compared to control. Although fewer small RNAs were differentially expressed during muscle differentiation in FSHD2 cells compared to controls, most of the known myogenic microRNAs, such as miR1, miR133a, and miR206 were induced in both FSHD2 and control muscle cells during differentiation. Our small RNA sequencing data analysis also revealed both DUX4- and SMCHD1-specific changes in FSHD2 muscle cells. Six FSHD2 microRNAs were affected by DUX4 overexpression in control myoblasts, whereas increased expression of tRNAs and 5S rRNAs in FSHD2 muscle cells was largely recapitulated in SMCHD1-depleted control myoblasts.

Inhibition of mTOR signaling using the rapalog everolimus is an FDA-approved targeted therapy for patients with lung and gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET). However, patients eventually progress on treatment, highlighting the need for additional therapies. We focused on pancreatic NETs (pNETs) and reasoned that treatment of these tumors upon progression on rapalog therapy, with an mTOR kinase inhibitor (mTORKi) such as CC-223 could overcome a number of resistance mechanisms in tumors and delay cardiac carcinoid disease. We performed preclinical studies using human pNET cells in vitro and injected them subcutaneously or orthotopically to determine tumor progression and cardiac function in mice treated with either rapamycin alone or switched to CC-223 upon progression. Detailed signaling and RNA sequencing analyses were performed on tumors that were sensitive or progressed on mTOR treatment. Approximately 57% of mice bearing pNET tumors which progressed on rapalog therapy showed a significant decrease in tumor volume upon a switch to CC-223. Moreover, mice treated with an mTORKi exhibited decreased cardiac dilation and thickening of heart valves than those treated with placebo or rapamycin alone. In conclusion, in the majority of pNETs that progress on rapalogs, it is possible to reduce disease progression using an mTORKi, such as CC-223. Moreover, CC-223 had an additional transient cardiac benefit on valvular fibrosis compared to placebo- or rapalog-treated mice. These results provide the preclinical rationale to further develop mTORKi clinically upon progression on rapalog therapy and to further test their long term cardioprotective benefit in those NET patients prone to carcinoid syndrome. We performed RNA sequencing analyses as an unbiased means to assess changes in gene expression. Our major goal was to identify the differences in tumor mRNAs between the CC-223- and non-CC-223 responders compared to the rapamycin alone treatment arm (Fig 5A in Orr-Asman et al manuscript). The analysis was conducted using 1 tumor each from 13 and 14 mice treated with rapamycin or switched to CC-223 respectively.",

Background: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been implicated in metastasis, drug resistance, survival under stress and also conferring stem cell-like traits to cancer cells. However, several of the studies have been carried out using model systems that don't appropriately recapitulate all stages of the dynamic process of EMT. Hence, there is a need to overcome this limitation by development of a model system that allows us to mimic each stage of EMT and accurately assess the plastic changes associated with it.Methods: We have derived a cancer cell line from the PyMT-MMTV model of breast cancer, named PyMT-1099 cells, and undertaken a detailed characterization of the morpho-genetic changes it undergoes during a TGFbeta-induced EMT. Further, we have also performed high throughput transcriptomics on PyMT-1099 cells undergoing EMT in a high resolution kinetic of TGFbeta treatment.Results: We show that PyMT-1099 cells undergo an EMT comparable to the classically used immortalized NMuMG cells as assessed by morphological, and marker expression changes on TGFbeta treatment. Further, PyMT-1099 cells can also migrate in vitro in response to TGFbeta treatment. These cells are also tumorigenic and lead to metastasis formation when transplanted into immunocompromised mice.Conclusion: In this study we report the development of PyMT-1099 cells as an excellent tool to model and study breast cancer-associated EMT both in vitro and in vivo and show that these cells overcome the limitations posed by other cellular systems currently being used to study EMT.

The fibroblast growth factor pathway is known to cooperate with the highly oncogenic Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in mouse models of breast cancer. To investigate the mechanisms involved in this cooperativity, we utilized MMTV-driven transgenic mouse lines expressing a drug-inducible model for FGF Receptor signaling (iFGFR) crossed with the previously characterized MMTV-Wnt-1 mouse model. In these bigenic mice, both iFGFR1 and iFGFR2 activation resulted in a dramatic enhancement of mammary tumorigenesis. Tumor microarray analysis identified no transcriptional enhancement of Wnt/beta-catenin targets, however, identified a protein translational gene signature that also correlated with elevated FGFR1 and FGFR2 expression in several human breast cancer data sets. Additionally, iFGFR1 activation resulted in enhanced polysome recruitment and a marked increase in protein expression of several different Wnt/beta-catenin target oncogenes. Rapid FGFR-induced ERK activation and phosphorylation of key translation regulators was observed both in vivo in the transgenic mouse model, and in human breast cancer cell lines treated with exogenous FGF. These studies suggest that translational regulation is a key rate-limiting step required for oncogenic cooperativity between the Wnt and FGF pathways. reference X sample.",

Memory T cells are important for protective immunity against infectious microorganisms. Such protection is achieved by cooperative action of memory T cell populations that differ in their tissue localization and functionality. We report on the identification of the fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 as marker for stratification of memory T cells with cytotoxic effector function from those with proliferative function in both, mice and man. Based on CX3CR1 and CD62L expression levels four distinct memory T cell populations can be distinguished based on their functional properties. Transcriptome and proteome profiling revealed that CX3CR1 expression was superior to CD62L to resolve memory T cell functionality and allowed determination of a core signature of memory T cells with cytotoxic effector function. This identifies a CD62Lhi CX3CR1+ memory T cell population with an identical gene signature to CD62LlowCX3CR1+ effector memory T cells. In lymph nodes, this so far unrecognized CD62LhiCX3CR1+ T cell population shows a distinct migration pattern and anatomic positioning compared to CD62LhiCX3CR1neg TCM.

    "text": "Expression profiling of 40 NSCLC cell lines. INTRODUCTION: CDKN2A (p16) inactivation is common in lung cancer and occurs via homozygous deletions, methylation of promoter region, or point mutations. Although p16 promoter methylation has been linked to KRAS mutation and smoking, the associations between p16 inactivation mechanisms and other common genetic mutations and smoking status are still controversial or unknown. METHODS: We determined all three p16 inactivation mechanisms with the use of multiple methodologies for genomic status, methylation, RNA, and protein expression, and correlated them with EGFR, KRAS, STK11 mutations and smoking status in 40 cell lines and 45 tumor samples of primary non-small-cell lung carcinoma. We also performed meta-analyses to investigate the impact of smoke exposure on p16 inactivation. RESULTS: p16 inactivation was the major mechanism of RB pathway perturbation in non-small-cell lung carcinoma, with homozygous deletion being the most frequent method, followed by methylation and the rarer point mutations. Inactivating mechanisms were tightly correlated with loss of mRNA and protein expression. p16 inactivation occurred at comparable frequencies regardless of mutational status of EGFR, KRAS, and STK11, however, the major inactivation mechanism of p16 varied. p16 methylation was linked to KRAS mutation but was mutually exclusive with EGFR mutation. Cell lines and tumor samples demonstrated similar results. Our meta-analyses confirmed a modest positive association between p16 promoter methylation and smoking. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that all the inactivation mechanisms are truly associated with loss of gene product and identify specific associations between p16 inactivation mechanisms and other genetic changes and smoking status. 40 NSCLC cell lines were profiled on Illumina WG6-V3 expression arrays. They consist of 4 groups of 10 cell lines each: non-smokers with EGFR mutation, non-smokers with EGFR wild-type, smokers with KRAS mutation, smokers with KRAS wild-type.

Background: Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is predicted to play a critical role in tumor progression and metastasis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma. Our goal was to elucidate a mechanism of tumor proliferation and metastasis using a novel murine model of EMT.Methods: 2x106 liver cells isolated from Ptenloxp/loxp;Alb-Cre+ mice, expanded from a single CD133+CD45- cell clone, Passage 0 (P0), were sequentially transplanted to obtain two passages of tumor cells, Passage 1 and 2 (P1 & P2) . Cells were analyzed for gene expression using microarray and real-time PCR. Functional analysis included cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in-vitro and orthotopic tumor growth and metastasis assays in-vivo.Results: Although P0, P1, and P2 each formed tumors consistent with mixed liver epithelium, within the P2 cells, two distinct cell types were clearly visible: cells with epithelial morphology similar to the P0 cells, and cells with fibroblastoid morphology. The P2 mesenchymal cells demonstrated increased locomotion on wound healing, increased cell invasion on Matrigel basement membrane, increased EMT associated gene Snail1, Zeb1, and Zeb2 expression, and down-regulated E-cadherin. P2 mesenchymal cells demonstrated significantly faster tumor growth compared to P2 Epithelial counterparts, with peritoneal seeding and invasion of intestine, pancreas, spleen, and lymph nodes. Furthermore, P2 mesenchymal cells secreted high levels of Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF), which acted in paracrine fashion to drive epithelial cells to undergo EMT.Conclusion: EMT is associated with a high rate of liver tumor proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in-vivo, which is driven by HGF in a feed-forward mechanism.

We herein demonstrate that Gfi1 inhibits the activation of Th1 program in CD4 T cells.

Tbx21, Eomes and Runx2 are identified as candidates for direct target of Gfi1. Gfi1 binds to the Tbx21, Eomes and Runx2 gene loci and represses histone H3K4 methylation levels.

This microarray study examines gene expression induced in the C57BL/6J mouse retina by hyperoxia over the 14-day period during which photoreceptors first resist, then succumb to, hyperoxia. METHODS: Young adult C57BL/6J mice were exposed to hyperoxia (75% oxygen) for up to 14 days. On day 0 (control), day 3, day 7, and day 14, retinal RNA was extracted and processed on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays. Microarray data were analyzed using GCOS Version 1.4 and GeneSpring Version 7.3.1. RESULTS: The overall numbers of hyperoxia-regulated genes increased monotonically with exposure. Within that increase, however, a distinctive temporal pattern was apparent. At 3 days exposure, there was prominent upregulation of genes associated with neuroprotection. By day 14, these early-responsive genes were downregulated, and genes related to cell death were strongly expressed. At day 7, the regulation of these genes was mixed, indicating a possible transition period from stability at day 3 to degeneration at day 14. CONCLUSIONS: Microarray analysis of the response of the retina to prolonged hyperoxia demonstrated a temporal pattern involving early neuroprotection and later cell death, and provided insight into the mechanisms involved in the two phases of response. As hyperoxia is a consistent feature of the late stages of photoreceptor degenerations, understanding the mechanisms of oxygen toxicity may be important therapeutically. 4 timepoints in total, 0d (control), 3d, 7d and 14d and a replicate per timepoint.

DOX administrated (DOX+) iDek mice promoted field cancerization and the development of OSCC in the environment exposed to carcinogen.

However, it remains unknown as to how E- and Id-proteins mechanistically enforce and maintain the naive T cell fate. Here we show that Id2 and Id3 suppressed the development and expansion of innate-variant TFH cells. Innate-variant TFH cells required MHC Class I-like signalling and were associated with germinal center B cell development. We found that Id2 and Id3 induced Foxo1 and Foxp1 expression to antagonize the activation of TFH transcription signature.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor with limited therapeutic options, possibly because of the highly tumorigenic subpopulations of stem cell-like cells. Mechanisms that sustain cancer stem cells are crucial to tumor progression. The polycomb group protein BMI1 (BMI1 proto-oncogene, polycomb ring finger) maintains cancer hallmarks including the glioblastoma stem-like cell (GSC) state. Ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (USP22) is highly expressed in and required for the maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Previously, we observed that forced expressed microRNA-218 in glioblastoma cells led to suppressed BMI1 expression. However, the pathways engaged by USP22 or driving BMI1 accumulation in GSCs remained elusive. Here, we found USP22 to be a novel deubiquitylase of BMI1. USP22 directly deubiquitylates and stabilizes BMI1. USP22 protein levels are elevated in tumor neurosphere. USP22 depletion induces BMI1 destabilization, and results in the inhibition of GSCs self-renewal by regulating a broad range of genes involved in glioma stemness and progression. Xenograft analyses using U87MG cells showed that both USP22 and BMI1 depletion attenuated tumor growth. Clinically, the expression levels of USP22 and BMI1 were positively correlated with those common targets like POSTN, HEY2, or PDGFRA and inversely correlated with ATF3 in human glioblastoma specimens. Taken together, our data reveals that USP22 functions as a novel deubiquitylase of BMI1 and inhibits self-renewal of GSCs by stabilizing BMI1. These findings also indicate that the USP22-BMI1 axis has a critical role in glioma tumorigenesis and that targeting the axis may provide a new therapeutic approach for human glioblastoma. 3 Samples, one transduced with control shRNA, one with BMI1 shRNA and one with USP22 shRNA.",

Chronic viruses and cancers thwart immune responses in humans by inducing T cell dysfunction. Using a murine chronic virus that models human infections, we investigated the function of the adhesion molecule, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) that is upregulated on responding T cells. PSGL-1-deficient mice unexpectedly cleared the virus due to dramatic increases in the intrinsic survival of multifunctional effector T cells that had downregulated PD-1 and other inhibitory receptors. Notably, this response resulted in CD4+ T cell-dependent immunopathology. Mechanistically, PSGL-1 ligation on exhausted CD8+ T cells inhibited TCR and IL-2 signaling, and upregulated PD-1, leading to diminished survival with TCR stimulation. In models of malignant melanoma where T cell dysfunction occurs, PSGL-1-deficiency led to PD-1 downregulation, improved T cell responses, and tumor control. Thus, PSGL-1 plays a fundamental role in balancing viral control and immunopathology, and also functions as a checkpoint that regulates T cell responses in the tumor microenvironment. WT or PSGL-1 KO mice were infected with 2 x 10^6 PFU LCMV Clone 13. Spleens from 10 WT or 10 PSGL-1 KO animals were pooled and processed. CD8+ T cells were negatively enriched from WT or PSGL-1 KO spleens (EasySep Stemcell). Purified T cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) for 10 minutes on ice, cells were washed. CD8+ T cells were stained with H2-Db-GP33-41 tetramers (NIH) and FACS sorted (BD FACS Aria). Sorted tetramer+ cells were PI negative and purity was >98%. Experiment was repeated twice to generate 2 WT (WT 1; WT 2) and 2 PSGL-1 KO (KO 1; KO 2) samples that represented 10 pooled spleens per sample.",

Microarray-based genome-wide measurements of copy number alterations and of transcriptome variations are proposed for neuroblastoma prognosis and possible treatment choice. Nonetheless, they lack to provide clues on a neglected layer of systems-level changes, the translatome, whose variations are defined by the activity of the translational regulatory machinery. Our study extends the conventional genome-wide approaches to translatome profiling in neuroblastoma, by means of polysomal sucrose gradient separation followed by microarray analysis. The panel of fourteen parental (not subcloned) neuroblastoma cell lines used in the study includes: CHP-134, SIMA, NB-69, LAN-1, KELLY, CHP-126, CHP-212, SK-N-BE(2), IMR-32, SK-N-AS, SK-N-SH, STA-NB-7, STA-NB-1, STA-NB-10 cells. Each cell line has been profiled with high resolution array CGH analysis for copy number changes, and for transcriptome and translatome variations.

Of particular interest are molecular regulators controlling the highly aggressive and poorly differentiated traits of basal-like breast carcinomas. Here we show that the Polycomb factor EZH2 maintains the differentiation state of basal-like breast cancer cells, and promotes the expression of progenitor-associated and basal-lineage genes. Specifically, EZH2 regulates the composition of basal-like breast cancer cell populations by promoting a \"bi-lineage\" differentiation state, in which cells co-express basal- and luminal-lineage markers. We show that human basal-like breast cancers contain a subpopulation of bi-lineage cells, and that EZH2-deficient cells give rise to tumors with a decreased proportion of such cells. Bi-lineage cells express genes that are active in normal luminal progenitors, and possess increased colony formation capacity, consistent with a primitive differentiation state. We found that GATA3, a driver of luminal differentiation, performs a function opposite to EZH2, acting to suppress bi-lineage identity and luminal progenitor gene expression. GATA3 levels increase upon EZH2 silencing, leading to the observed decrease in bi-lineage cell numbers. Our findings reveal a novel role for EZH2 in controlling basal-like breast cancer differentiation state and intra-tumoral cell composition. Total of four treatments (HCC70 cells stably expressing shEZH2, shEED, or EZH2 cDNA, and MDA-MB-468 cells stably expressing shEZH2) were done in duplicates, each with its own control.",

Targeting the desmoplastic stroma of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) holds promise to augment the effect of chemotherapy, but so far success remains limited in the clinic. Furthermore, preclinical mouse models suggest that near-depletion of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) carries a risk of accelerating PDAC progression. These concerns underscore the need to concurrently target the key signaling mechanisms that drive the malignant attributes of both CAFs and PDAC cells. We previously reported that inhibition of Interleukin-1 Receptor Associated Kinase 4 (IRAK4) suppresses NF-kB activity and promotes chemotherapy response in PDAC cells. In this study, we show that CAFs in PDAC tumors robustly express activated IRAK4 and NF-kb. The role of IRAK4 and NF-kB in PDAC CAFs has not been reported, and should be clarified before advancing IRAK4 inhibitors to the clinic. Using shRNAs and small molecular inhibitors, we found that IRAK4 is a key driver of NF-kB activity in CAFs. We showed that CAFs utilizes IRAK4 to drive tumor fibrosis, support PDAC cells proliferation, survival and chemoresistance in vitro and in vivo. From cytokine array analysis of CAFs and microarray analysis of PDAC cells, we identified IL-1b as a key cytokine that activates IRAK4 in CAFs. Targeting IRAK4 or IL-1b renders PDAC tumors less fibrotic and more sensitive to gemcitabine in vivo. Moreover, high IL-1b expression by immunohistochemistry in PDAC stroma is strongly associated with poor overall survival. Together, our studies established a tumor-stroma IL-1b-IRAK4 feedforward circuitry that can be therapeutically disrupted to render chemotherapy more effective in PDAC. We use both pharmacological and shRNA approaches to explore the contribution of IRAK1/4 inhibition in pancreatic cancer cells. For pharmacological approach, we use PANC-1 and Capan-1 for study since these two cell lines express activated form of IRAK1 and IRAK4. For shRNA approach, we use PANC-1 for analysis.",

While these egc superantigens are far more prevalent in clinical S. aureus isolates than non-egc superantigens, they are not a prominent cause of toxic shock. Moreover, neutralizing antibodies against egc superantigens are very rare, even among carriers of egc-positive S. aureus strains. In search of an explanation we have tested two non-exclusive hypotheses: 1) egc and non-egc superantigens have unique intrinsic properties and drive the immune system into different directions; 2) egc and non-egc-superantigens are released by S. aureus under different conditions, which shape the immune response.A comparison of three egc (SEI, SElM and SElO) and three non-egc superantigens (SEB, SElQ, TSST-1) revealed that both induced proliferation of human PBMC with comparable potency and elicited similar Th1/Th2-cytokine signatures. This was supported by gene expression analysis of PBMC stimulated with one representative superantigen from each group (SEI and SEB). They induced very similar transcriptional changes, especially of inflammation-associated gene networks, corresponding to a very strong Th1- and Th17-dominated immune response.In contrast, the regulation of superantigen release differed markedly between both superantigen groups. Egc-encoded proteins were secreted by S. aureus during exponential growth, while non-egc superantigens were released in the stationary phase.We conclude that the distinct biological behavior of egc and non-egc superantigens is not due to their intrinsic properties, which are very similar, but caused by their differential release by S. aureus. PBMCs from 3 healthy blood donors were purified and treated with Medium (control) and recombinant staphylococcal superantigens SEB and SEI.

Here we show by chromatin-IP, MNase and DNaseI assays followed by deep sequencing that the progesterone receptor (PR) requires nucleosomes for optimal binding and function. In breast cancer cells treated with progestins we identified 25,000 PR binding sites (PRbs), the majority encompassing several copies of the hexanucleotide TGTYCY, highly abundant in the genome. We found that functional PRbs accumulate around progesterone-induced genes mainly in enhancers, are enriched in DHS but exhibit high nucleosome occupancy.

Bmi1 is responsible for conversion of adult mouse astrocytes and fibroblasts into neural stem cell-like cells and conversion of fibroblasts into iPSCs under enforced expression of Oct4. Here, in the first step of generating iPSCs, stable intermediate cells were generated from mouse astrocytes by Bmi1 in the absence of other transcription factors.

The global gene expression profiles were compared after the central and peripheral leptin treatments in ob/ob mice and C57BL6 mice were used for the baseline gene expression. The groups are as below:Liver_B6: C57BL6 mice Liver_VEH_SQ: ob/ob mice with vehicle subcutaneous treatmentLiver_LEP_SQ: ob/ob mice with leptin subcutaneous treatmentLiver_VEH_ICV: ob/ob mice with vehicle intracerebroventricular treatment, Liver_LEP_ICV: ob/ob mice with leptin intracerebroventricular treatment, Liver_LEP_ICVN: represents four animals from LEP_ICV group in which treatment failed or the cannula may not have been in place. While analyzing the phenotype data, we found that there was no weight loss in these four animals. Sectioning of the brain could not confirm placement of the cannula in these animals. The expression of these animals is very similar to the vehicle treated animals.",

Previously, we have reported that genomic loss of 14q occurs more frequently in high grade clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) than low grade ones and shows a significant impact on the expression levels of genes located on this region, suggesting that the genes located on the region and downregulated by the loss may be involved in the malignant transformation of ccRCCs. Here, among the genes located on the minimal common region of 14q loss, we found that 6 were significantly downregulated in high grade ccRCCs due to copy number loss. Using the data set from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network, downregulation of one out of the 6 genes, WDR20, was significantly associated with poorer prognosis for the patients with ccRCC, suggesting that downregulation of WDR20 may be involved in the malignant transformation of ccRCC. In functional assays, exogeneous WDR20 significantly inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in RCC cell lines. Interestingly, the phosphorylation levels of ERK and AKT, which reportedly contribute to the malignant phenotype of RCC cells, were clearly reduced by the exogeneous expression of WDR20. Thus, our data suggest that downregulation of WDR20 due to 14q loss may be involved in the malignant transformation of ccRCCs in part through the activation of ERK and AKT pathways. Downregulated expression levels of genes in minimal common region due to 14q loss. Expression levels of 6 genes were determined by microarray analysis and compared between normal kidney tissues (normal, n=16), low grade (low, n=16) and high grade (high, n=16) ccRCCs. The expression level (log2) normalized by the median expression level for the 16 normal samples.",

In the present study, we applied microarray technology to define a biosignature from the whole genome expression in lung and spleen samples after BCG vaccination and M. bovis infection of BALB/c mice. The aims were two-fold, namely to define biosignatures that could predict vaccine success before challenge, and biomarker patterns that correlated with anamnestic protective responses following exposure to virulent M. bovis. Further, Our aim was to define these markers to be detectable without in vitro antigenic challenge. After BCG vaccination, we defined a specific pulmonary gene expression signature related to the connective tissue development and function network that predicted vaccine success before M. bovis challenge. In addition, a Th17-related cytokine profile was found that correlated with vaccine-induced protective immunity following infection with virulent M. bovis in the lung as well as additional genes that were up-regulated in the spleens of vaccinated animals post-infection that was related to neutrophil biology and inflammation. This study has therefore prioritized both biomarkers predicting vaccination success before challenge and bio-signatures that are associated with protective immune responses that will be useful to evaluate future vaccine candidates. Two groups of 20 mice each were immunised by a single intradermal injection of 2 x 10 to 5 CFU of M. bovis BCG (Vaccinated), or Hanks buffered salt solution (HBSS) (Unvaccinated). Six weeks later 5 mice from each group were euthanized for immunological analyses and the remaining mice from each group were challenged with approx 600 CFU M. bovis via the intranasal route.

We investigate here the involvement of FGFR1 in glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSLC) radioresistance mechanisms. We first demonstrated that the survival after irradiation was significantly diminished in FGFR1-silenced (FGFR1-) GSLC compared to control GSLC. The transcriptome analysis of GSLCs FGFR1(-) showed that FOX family members are differentially regulated by FGFR1 inhibition, particularly with an upregulation of FOXN3 and a downregulation of FOXM1. GSLC survival after irradiation was significantly increased after FOXN3 silencing and decreased after FOXM1 inhibition, showing opposite effects of FGFR1/FOX family members on cell response to ionizing radiation. Silencing FGFR1 or FOXM1 downregulated genes involved in mesenchymal transition such as GLI2, TWIST1, and ZEB1 in GSC. It also dramatically reduced GSLC migration, strongly suggesting that FGFR1/FOXM1 pathway which regulates GSLC radioresistance. Databases analysis confirmed that the combined expression of FGFR1/FOXM1/MELK/GLI2/ZEB1/TWIST1 is significantly associated with patients overall survival after chemo-radiotherapy treatment. All these results, associated with our previous conduced ones with differentiated cells, clearly established that FGFR1-FOXM1 dependent GSC radioresistance pathway is a central actor of GBM treatment resistance and a key target to inhibit in the aim to increase the sensitivity of GBM to the radiotherapy.

Skin tanning is one such dynamic response that maintains genome integrity of epidermal cells.

By designing a pigmentation oscillator, in this study we delineate the role of interferon gamma (IFN-g) signaling in skin pigmentation homeostasis. IFN-g signaling reversibly controls maturation of the key organelle melanosome by concerted regulation of several pigmentation genes. We show that this temporal effect is mediated through interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) independent of the central regulator microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). Chronic expression of IFN-g in mouse and human skin shows hypopigmentation phenotype, further providing a strong support to the under-appreciated function of IFN-g in skin pigmentation. Our studies thus reveal the hitherto missing link between immune system and pigmentation, which may have implications in depigmentary and malignant cutaneous disorders. there are 12 samples from two consecutive cycles of pigmentation oscillator, termed set 1 and set 2 analysis is performed wrt to day 0 of first cycle.",

Although macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) have been proposed to drive the psoriatic cascade, their largely overlapping phenotype hampered studying their respective role. Topical application of Imiquimod, a Toll-like receptor 7 agonist, induces psoriasis in patients and psoriasiform inflammation in mice. We showed that daily application of Imiquimod for 14 days recapitulated both the initiation and the maintenance phase of psoriasis. Based on our ability to discriminate Langerhans cells (LCs), conventional DCs, monocytes, monocyte-derived DCs and macrophages in the skin, we characterized their dynamics during both phases of psoriasis. During the initiation phase, neutrophils infiltrated the epidermis whereas monocytes and monocyte-derived DCs were predominant in the dermis. During the maintenance phase, LCs and macrophage numbers increased in the epidermis and dermis, respectively. LC expansion resulted from local proliferation, a conclusion supported by transcriptional analysis. Continuous depletion of LCs during the course of Imiquimod treatment aggravated chronic psoriatic symptoms as documented by an increased influx of neutrophils and a stronger inflammation. Therefore, by developing a mouse model that mimics the human disease more accurately, we established that LCs play a negative regulatory role during the maintenance phase of psoriasis. DCs and other myeloid cell types were isolated from lymphoid organs as previously described (Henri et al. 2010). Briefly, LNs were cut into small pieces and digested for 20 min at room temperature with a mixture of type II collagenase (Worthington Biochemical) and DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich).

T helper 17 (Th17) cell development is programmed by the orphan nuclear receptor RORgt, but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Nuclear receptor-mediated transcriptional activation depends on coactivators. Here we show that the steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) critically regulates Th17 cell differentiation. Reduced incidence of experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) associated with decreased Th17 cell generation in vivo was observed in mice with SRC-3 deletion specifically in T cells. In vitro, SRC-3 deficiency did not affect TGF-/IL-6-induced Th17 cell generation but severely impaired pathogenic Th17 differentiation induced by IL-1/IL-6/IL-23.Microarrays were used to showed that SRC-3 not only regulates IL-17A but also IL-1R1 expression. SRC-3 bound to Il17a and Il1r1 loci in a RORtdependent manner and was required for recruitment of the p300 acetyltransferase. Thus, SRC-3 is critical in RORt-dependent gene expression during Th17 cell-driven autoimmune diseases.

Raf1 L613V expression in cardiomyocytes or activated fibroblasts exacerbates pressure overload-evoked fibrosis. Endothelial/endocardial (EC) Raf1 L613V causes cardiac hypertrophy without affecting contractility. Co-culture and neutralizing antibody experiments reveal a cytokine hierarchy (TNFa->IL6) from Raf1 L613V -expressing ECs that drives cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro. Furthermore, post-natal TNFa inhibition normalizes the increased wall thickness and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vivo. We conclude that NS cardiomyopathy involves cardiomyocytes, ECs, and fibroblasts, TNFa/IL6 signaling components represent potential therapeutic targets, and abnormal EC signaling might contribute to other forms of LVH. control vs. Raf1 L613V/+ knock-in cardiomyocytes.",

Circulating levels of the gut microbe-derived metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide(TMAO) have recently been linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Here we performed transcriptional profiling in mouse models of altered reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), and serendipitously identified the TMAO-generating enzyme flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) as a powerful modifier of cholesterol metabolism and RCT. Knockdown of FMO3 in cholesterol-fed mice alters biliary lipid secretion, blunts intestinal cholesterol absorption, and limits the production of hepatic oxysterols and cholesteryl esters. Furthermore, FMO3 knockdown stimulates basal and liver X receptor (LXR)-stimulated macrophage RCT, thereby improving cholesterol balance. Conversely, FMO3 knockdown exacerbates hepatic ER stress and inflammation in part by decreasing hepatic oxysterol levels and subsequent LXR activation. FMO3 is thus identified as a central integrator of hepatic cholesterol and triacylglycerol metabolism, inflammation, and ER stress. These studies suggest that the gut microbiota-driven TMA/FMO3/TMAO pathway is a key regulator of lipid metabolism and inflammation. To identify potential regulators of macrophage reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), liver was isolated from two independent mouse models where the non-biliary RCT pathway known as transintestinal cholesterol excretion (TICE) was either chronically (NPC1L1-liver-transgenic mice) or acutely (ACAT2 antisense oligonucleotide treatment) stimulated.

Single - cell profiling of patient tumours and of mouse models is revealing that many cancers are constituted of communities of genetically and phenotypically distinct clonal lineages 1 - 12. A functional model of breast cancer heterogeneity revealed that clonal sub - populations proficient at generating circulating tumour cells were not equally capable of forming metastases at secondary sites 13. A combination of differential expression and focused in vitro and in vivo RNAi screens revealed candidate drivers of metastasis discriminating these clones, which were then evaluated in gene expression datasets from breast cancer patients. Among these, Asparagine Synthetase (Asns) expression in a patient's primary tumour was most strongly correlated with later metastatic relapse. Silencing of Asns reduced both metastatic potential in vivo and invasive potential in vitro. Conversely, increasing the availability of extracellular asparagine increased the invasive potential of mouse and human breast cancer cells, and enforced Asns expression promoted metastasis. Decreasing asparagine availability in mice by treatment with L-asparaginase or even by dietary restriction strongly reduced metastasis from orthotopic tumours. Asparagine availability varies betwe en tissues, potentially explaining selective effects on particular steps of tumor progression. Asparagine limitation reduced the production of proteins that promote the epithelial to mesenchymal transition, providing one potential mechanism for how the availability of a single amino acid could regulate metastatic progression.

A feeder-free culture on Matrigel in hES medium conditioned by these autogeneic feeder cells (T3HDF) was established to maintain the undifferentiated growth of hES-T3 cells (T3/CMHDF) for 8 passages. Results: The gene expression profiles of mRNAs, microRNAs and proteins between the undifferentiated T3/HDF and T3/CMHDF cells were shown to be very similar, and their expression profiles were also found to be similar to those of T3/MEF and T3/CMMEF cells grown on MEF feeder and feeder-free Matrigel in MEF-conditioned medium, respectively. The abundantly expressed genes of T3/HDF, T3/CMHDF, T3/MEF and T3/CMMEF cells were found to play prominent roles in signaling pathways and GO process networks.

Phenotypic and metabolic heterogeneity within tumors is a major barrier to effective cancer therapy. Yet how metabolism is implicated in specific phenotypes, and whether lineage-restricted mechanisms control key metabolic vulnerabilities remains poorly understood. In melanoma, down-regulation of the lineage addiction oncogene Microphthalmia-associated Transcription Factor (MITF) is a hallmark of the proliferative-to-invasive phenotype switch, though how MITF promotes proliferation and suppresses invasion is poorly defined. Here we show that MITF is a lineage restricted activator of the key lipogenic enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), and that SCD is required for MITFHigh melanoma cell proliferation. By contrast MITFLow cells are insensitive to SCD inhibition. Significantly, the MITF-SCD axis suppresses metastasis, inflammatory signalling, and an ATF4-mediated feedback-loop that maintains dedifferentiation. Our results reveal that MITF is a lineagespecific regulator of metabolic reprogramming, whereby fatty acid composition is a driver of melanoma phenotype-switching, and highlight that cell phenotype dictates response to drugs targeting lipid metabolism. 501mel and IGR37 melanoma cell lines were treated with the indicated siRNA or SCD inhibitors for 48h prior to RNA extraction and sequencing.",

The development and severity of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and other chronic inflammatory conditions can be influenced by host genetic and environmental factors, including signals derived from commensal bacteria. However, the mechanisms that integrate these diverse cues remain undefined. Here we demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) isolated from IBD patients exhibit decreased expression of the epigenome-modifying enzyme histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). Further, genome-wide analyses of murine IECs that lack HDAC3 (HDAC3DIEC) revealed that HDAC3 deficiency resulted in dysregulated gene expression coupled with alterations in histone acetylation. Critically, conventionally-housed HDAC3DIEC mice demonstrated loss of Paneth cells, impaired IEC function and alterations in the composition of intestinal commensal bacteria. In addition, HDAC3DIEC mice exhibited significantly increased susceptibility to intestinal damage and inflammation, indicating that epithelial expression of HDAC3 plays a central role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Strikingly, rederivation of HDAC3DIEC mice into germ-free conditions revealed that dysregulated IEC gene expression, Paneth cell homeostasis, and intestinal barrier function were largely restored in the absence of commensal bacteria. Collectively, these data indicate that the HDAC3 is a critical factor that integrates commensal bacteria-derived signals to calibrate epithelial cell responses required to establish normal host-commensal relationships and maintain intestinal homeostasis. In this study, we performed gene expression profiling to examine how the transcriptional profiles in primary live, EpCAM+ IECs from the large intestine differed between control HDAC3FF mice (3 biological replicates) and IEC-intrinsic knockout HDAC3DIEC mice (3 biological replicates).",

Ninety-two samples of pathologically reviewed stage I endometrial cancers (80 endometrioid and 12 serous) with a heterogeneous distribution of grade and depth of myometrial invasion (i.e. 9 IAG1, 14 IAG2, 7 IAG3, 14 IBG1, 12 IBG2, 13 IBG3, 7 ICG1, 10 ICG2, and 6 ICG3) were examined in relation to 12 samples of atrophic endometrium from postmenopausal women. Specimens were analyzed using oligonucleotide microarray analysis and a subset of the differentially expressed transcripts was validated using quantitative PCR. Comparison of early stage cancers with normal endometrium samples by the univariate t-test with 10,000 permutations identified 900 genes that were differentially regulated by at least 4-fold at a p value of <0.001. Unsupervised analysis revealed that when compared to normal endometrium, serous and endometrioid stage I cancers appeared to have similar expression patterns.

Integrative analysis of gene expression profiles from a pair of metastatic and non-metastatic prostate cancer tissue xenografts was used to identify potential prostate cancer metastasis-driving genes. Among the candidate genes found, GATA2, a master regulator gene in the development of hematopoietic system, was particularly interesting since it is an important pioneer factor in the regulation of AR-target gene in prostate cancer. In consistent with our finding, elevated expression of the GATA2 gene in metastatic prostate cancers was found and its expression was significantly correlated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients. Furthermore, indication of the GATA2 gene maybe the metastasis-driving gene was evidenced in decreased of cell migration, tissue invasion and focal adhesion disassembly in GATA2-down-regulated LNCaP cells.

Human toxicogenomic studies to date have been of limited size, have mainly addressed exposures at the upper end of typical ranges of human exposure, and have often lacked precise, individual estimates of exposure. Previously, we identified genes associated with exposure to high (>10 ppm) levels of the leukemogen, benzene, through transcriptomic analyses of blood cells from small numbers of occupationally exposed workers. Here, we have expanded the study to 125 workers exposed to a wide range of benzene levels, including <1 ppm. Study design, and analysis with a mixed effects model, removed sources of biological and experimental variability and revealed highly significant widespread perturbation of gene expression at all exposure levels. Benzene is an established cause of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and may cause one or more lymphoid malignancies in humans. Interestingly, acute myeloid leukemia was among the most significant pathways impacted by benzene exposure in the present study. Further, at most exposure levels, immune response pathways including T cell receptor signaling, B cell receptor signaling, and Toll like receptor signaling were impacted, providing support for the biological plausibility of an association between lymphoma and benzene exposure. We also identified a 16-gene expression signature modified by all levels of benzene exposure, comprising genes with roles in immune response, inflammatory response, cell adhesion, cell-matrix adhesion, and blood coagulation. Overall, these findings support, and expand upon, our current understanding of the mechanisms by which benzene may induce hematotoxicity, leukemia and lymphoma. Furthermore, this study shows that with good study design and analysis, transcriptome profiling of the blood of chemically-exposed humans can identify relevant biomarkers across a range of exposures and inform about potential associations with disease risks.Key words: occupational exposure. 29 workers exposed to <<1ppm benzene at most dosimetry reading over a 14-month period (Very Low), 30 exposed to average <1ppm (Low), 11 exposed to 5-10 ppm (High), 13 exposed to >10 ppm (Very High), and 42 unexposed controls (Control) who were frequency-matched to these subjects on the basis of age and gender were analyzed (technical replicates on some subjects, see SubjectID/description).",

Downregulation of expression and activity levels of the astroglial glutamate transporter EAAT2 is thought to be implicated in motor neuron excitotoxicity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We previously reported that EAAT2 is cleaved by caspase-3 at the cytosolic C-terminus domain, impairing the transport activity and generating a proteolytic fragment found to be SUMO1 conjugated (CTE-SUMO1). We show here that this fragment accumulates in the nucleus of spinal cord astrocytes in vivo throughout the disease stages of the SOD1-G93A mouse model of ALS. In vitro expression in spinal cord astrocytes of the C-terminus peptide of EAAT2 (CTE), which was artificially fused to SUMO1 (CTE-SUMO1fus) to mimic the endogenous SUMOylation reaction, recapitulates the nuclear accumulation of the fragment seen in vivo and causes caspase-3 activation and axonal growth impairment in motor neuron-derived NSC-34 cells and primary motor neurons co-cultured with CTE-SUMO1fus-expressing spinal cord astrocytes. This indicates that CTE-SUMO1fus could trigger non-cell autonomous mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Prolonged nuclear accumulation of CTE-SUMO1fus in astrocytes leads to their degeneration, although the time frame of the cell-autonomous toxicity is longer than the one for the indirect toxic effect on motor neurons. As more evidence on the implication of SUMO substrates in neurodegenerative diseases emerges, our observations strongly suggest that the nuclear accumulation in spinal cord astrocytes of a SUMOylated proteolytic fragment of the astroglial glutamate transporter EAAT2 could take part to the pathogenesis of ALS and suggest a novel, unconventional role for EAAT2 in motor neuron degeneration in ALS.

    "text": "Temporal induction of immunoregulatory processes coincides with age-dependent resistance to viral-induced type 1 diabetes [Rat]. A need exists for biomarkers in T1D that can 1) sensitively and specifically detect disease-related immune activity prior to, and independent of, measurement of auto-antibodies towards islet cell antigens; 2) define immunopathological mechanisms; and 3) monitor changes in the inflammatory state associated with disease progression or response to therapeutic intervention. In an effort to fill this gap, we have applied a novel bioassay to both human and BB rat T1D whereby the complex milieu of inflammatory mediators present in plasma can be indirectly detected through their ability to drive transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) drawn from healthy, unrelated donors. The resultant gene expressions are comprehensively measured with a microarray. In our human studies, we find that plasma of recent-onset T1D patients induces expression of a pro-inflammatory signature consisting in part of many interleukin-1 (IL-1) regulated genes related to immunological activation and immunocyte chemotaxis compared to unrelated healthy controls. This signature has been found to resolve in long-standing T1D subjects (>10 years post-onset), thus associating it with active autoimmunity. Importantly, this signature has been detected in pre-onset samples of progressors to T1D years prior to onset and prior to development of auto-antibodies directed towards islet antigens.In applying this approach to the BN rat, we observed that samples collected from both sub-strains at 60 days of age induced transcription of genes encoding cytokines, immune receptors, and signaling molecules consistent with a their shared susceptibility and immune activation. The DRlyp/lyp signature was differentiated from that of the DR+/+ by more robust induction of many interleukin (IL)-1-regulated genes. Treatment of DRlyp/lyp rats with IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RN) delayed onset and, in part, normalized the signature, suggesting that this approach may prove useful in monitoring the effect of therapeutic interventions in human T1D. Consistent with the presence of TREG cells in DR+/+ rats, we observed induction of a signature possessing negative regulators of transcription and inflammation.

OBJECTIVE: Glial progenitor cells are abundant in adult human white matter. This study was designed to identify signaling pathways regulating their self-renewal and fate.METHODS: We compared the transcriptional profiles of freshly sorted adult human white matter progenitor cells (WMPCs), purified by A2B5-based immunomagnetic sorting, with those of the white matter from which they derived.RESULTS: We identified 132 genes differentially expressed by WMPCs; these included principal components of five receptor-defined signaling pathways, represented by platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) and type 3 fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR3), receptor tyrosine phosphatase-beta/zeta (RTPZ), notch, and syndecan3. WMPCs also differentially expressed the bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) inhibitors neuralin and BAMBI (BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor), suggesting tonic defense against BMP signaling. Differential overexpression of RTPZ was accompanied by that of its modulators pleiotrophin, NrCAM, tenascin, and the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, suggesting the importance of RTPZ signaling to WMPCs. When exposed to the RTPZ inhibitor bpV(phen), or lentiviral-shRNAi against RTPZ, WMPCs differentiated as oligodendrocytes. Conversely, when neuralin and BAMBI were antagonized by BMP4, astrocytic differentiation was induced, which was reversible by noggin.INTERPRETATION: The RTPZ and BMP pathways regulate the self-maintenance of adult human WMPCs, and can be modulated to induce their oligodendrocytic or astrocytic differentiation. As such, they provide targets by which to productively mobilize resident progenitor cells of the adult human brain. 6 samples, three biological replicates (individual patients), 2 groups (A2B5+ and unsorted cells).",

The goal of this experiment was to determine the differences at the level of transcription between Nlrc4-T337S mice and WT in order to identify further areas of inquiry.Methods: Pooled cDNA libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, mapped to mm9 using Tophat v2.1, and quantified using Partek GSv6.6 software. Reads were converted to TPM and a 0.5 TPM offset added to all transcripts. Non-coding genes and genes with no sample > 1 TPM were removedResults: Using tophat/2.1.0, we mapped about 50 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build mm9) and identified 22986 transcripts in the intestines of WT and Nlrc4-T337S mice. Compared to WT IECs, Nlrc4-T337S had a 17-fold increase in Ubd, as well as increases in multiple genes that were identified as part of the MHC-II antigen presentation pathway.Conclusions: Our study found that Nlrc4-T337S IECs have a different RNA-profile than WT mice caused by their point mutation, which led to the discovery of increased proliferation of Nlrc4-T337S IECs as well as increased MHC-II expression.

We compared the transcriptomes of patient-derived tumors regressing on MAPKi therapy against MAPKi-induced temporal transcriptomic states in human melanoma cell lines or murine melanoma in immune-competent mice. Despite heterogeneous dynamics of clinical tumor regression, residual tumors displayed highly recurrent transcriptomic alterations and enriched processes, which were also observed in MAPKi-selected cell lines (implying tumor cell-intrinsic reprogramming) or in bulk mouse tumors (and the CD45-negative or -positive fractions,, implying tumor cell-intrinsic or stromal/immune alterations, respectively). Tumor cell-intrinsic reprogramming attenuated MAPK-dependency, while enhancing mesenchymal, angiogenic and IFN-inflammatory features and growth/survival dependence on multi-RTKs and PD-L2. In the immune compartment, PD-L2 upregulation in CD11c+ immunocytes drove the loss of T-cell inflammation and promoted BRAFi resistance. Thus, residual melanoma early on MAPKi therapy already displays potentially exploitable adaptive transcriptomic, epigenomic, immune-regulomic alterations.

The purpose of the dataset is to analyze expression of genes induced by KRASThe proto-oncogene KRAS is mutated in a wide array of human cancers, most of which are aggressive and respond poorly to standard therapies. Although the identification of specific oncogenes has led to the development of clinically effective, molecularly targeted therapies in some cases, KRAS has remained refractory to this approach. An alternative strategy for targeting KRAS is to identify gene products that, when suppressed or inhibited, result in cell death only in the presence of an oncogenic allele. Here we have used systematic RNA interference (RNAi) to detect synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic KRAS and found that the non-canonical IkB kinase, TBK1, was selectively essential in cells that harbor mutant KRAS. Suppression of TBK1 induced apoptosis specifically in human cancer cell lines that depend on oncogenic KRAS expression. In these cells, TBK1 activated NF- B anti-apoptotic signals involving cREL and BCL-XL that were essential for survival, providing mechanistic insights into this synthetic lethal interaction. These observations identify TBK1 as a potential therapeutic target in KRAS mutant tumors and establish a general approach for the rational identification of co-dependent pathways in cancer.

Purpose: The incidence of malignant melanoma is increasing worldwide in fair-skinned populations. Melanomas respond poorly to systemic therapy, and metastatic melanomas inevitably become fatal. Although spontaneous regression, likely due to immune defense activation, rarely occurs, we lack a biological rationale and predictive markers in selecting patients for immune therapy. Experimental Design: We performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering of global gene expression data from stage IV melanomas in 57 patients. For further characterization, we used immunohistochemistry of selected markers, genome-wide DNA copy number analysis, genetic and epigenetic analysis of the Q3 CDKN2A locus, and NRAS/BRAF mutation screening. Results: The analysis revealed four distinct subtypes with gene signatures characterized by expression of immune response, pigmentation differentiation, proliferation, or stromal composition genes. Although all subtypes harbored NRAS and BRAF mutations, there was a significant difference between subtypes (P < 0.01), with no BRAF/NRAS wild-type samples in the proliferative subtype. Additionally, the proliferative subtype was characterized by a high frequency of CDKN2A homozygous deletions (P < 0.01). We observed a different prognosis between the subtypes (P = 0.01), with a particularly poor survival for patients harboring tumors of the proliferative subtype compared with the others (P = 0.003). Importantly, the clinical relevance of the subtypes was validated in an independent cohort of 44 stage III and IV melanomas. Moreover, low expression of an a priori defined gene set associated with immune response signaling was significantly associated with poor outcome (P = 0.001). Conclusions: Our data reveal a biologically based taxonomy of malignant melanomas with prognostic effect and support an influence of the antitumoral immune response on outcome.

Acute myeloid leukemia is a heterogeneous disease with regard to the underlying genetic and molecular pathophysiology. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exert significant anti-proliferative effects in various malignant cells in vitro and in vivo. Hence, these agents can be utilized to study potential disease specific anti-proliferative pathways. In this study, a total number of 42 bone marrow derived CD34+ cells from de novo AML patients and the AML cell lines THP-1 and HL-60 were treated with the NSAIDs Sulindac sulfide and Diclofenac. We examined viability, apoptosis, differentiation and addressed the molecular mechanisms involved. We found a consistent induction of apoptosis and to some extent myeloid differentiation in NSAID treated AML cells. Comprehensive protein and gene expression profiling of Diclofenac treated AML cells revealed transcriptional activation of GADD45a and its downstream MAPK/JNK pathway as well as increased protein levels of the Caspase-3 precursor. This points towards a role of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) in NSAID mediated apoptosis. This was dependent on JNK activity as addition of a specific JNK-inhibitor abrogated apoptosis. Furthermore, the AP-1 transcription factor family members' c-Jun, JunB and Fra-2 were transcriptionally activated in NSAID treated AML cells. Re-expression of these transcription factors led to activation of GADD45a with induction of apoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that NSAIDs induce apoptosis in AML through a novel pathway involving increased expression of AP-1 heterodimers, which by itself is sufficient to induce GADD45a expression with consecutive activation of JNK and induction of apoptosis. . HL-60 and THP-1 AML cells were treated with 100 uM Diclofenac or DMSO as control for 48 hours. Each experiment was performed in duplicate. After this treatment total RNA of the cells was harvested and analysed by means of gene expression profiling with the Affymetrix HU-133A array.",

Given SOX4's many roles in embryonic development and context-dependent regulation of gene expression, we sought to understand SOX4's contribution to bladder cancer and to elucidate SOX4 regulated genes that might contribute to tumorigenesis. We employed a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) method to transcriptionally repress SOX4 expression in T24 bladder cancer cell lines, rescued these cell lines with lentivirally expressed SOX4, and performed whole genome expression profiling. SOX4 knockdown cells exhibited decreased invasive capabilities but no changes in migration or proliferation, while rescue with SOX4 lentiviral vector restored the invasive phenotype.

A gene expression signature classifying telomerase and ALT immortalisation reveals an hTERT regulatory network and suggests a mesenchymal stem cell origin for ALTTelomere length is maintained by 2 known mechanisms, activation of telomerase or alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). The molecular mechanisms regulating the ALT phenotype are poorly understood and it is unknown how the decision of which pathway to activate is made at the cellular level. We have shown previously that active repression of telomerase gene expression by chromatin remodelling of the promoters is one mechanism of regulation, however other genes and signalling networks are likely to be required to regulate telomerase and maintain the ALT phenotype. Using gene expression profiling we have uncovered a signature of 1305 genes to distinguish telomerase positive and ALT cell lines. By combining this with gene expression profiles of liposarcoma tissue samples we refined this signature to 297 genes significantly associated with telomere maintenance mechanism. Network analysis of known direct interactions between genes within this signature revealed a regulatory signalling network consistent with a model of hTERT repression in ALT cell lines and liposarcomas. This network expands on our existing knowledge of hTERT regulation and provides a platform to understand differential regulation of hTERT in different tumour types and normal tissues. In addition we show evidence to suggest a novel mesenchymal stem cell origin for ALT immortalisation in cell lines and mesenchymal tissues.Keywords: cell type comparison, gene expression.

We present a high-throughput approach that uses CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to discover regulatory elements and identify their target genes. We assess >1 megabase (Mb) of sequence in the vicinity of 2 essential transcription factors, MYC and GATA1, and identify 9 distal enhancers that control gene expression and cellular proliferation. Quantitative features of chromatin state and chromosome conformation distinguish the 7 enhancers that regulate MYC from other elements that do not, suggesting a strategy for predicting enhancer-promoter connectivity. This CRISPRi-based approach can be applied to dissect transcriptional networks and interpret the contributions of noncoding genetic variation to human disease.

Little is known about their pathogenesis and their cellular origin, and morphological and immunophenotypical overlap exists between ALK- ALCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). We conducted gene expression profiling of microdissected lymphoma cells of ALK+ and ALK- systemic ALCL, cutaneous ALCL and cHL, and of eight subsets of normal T and NK cells. The analysis supports a derivation of ALCL from activated T cells, but the lymphoma cells acquired a gene expression pattern hampering an assignment to a CD4+, CD8+ or CD30+ T cell origin. Indeed, ALCL display a general down-modulation of T cell characteristic molecules. All ALCL types show significant expression of NFkB target genes and upregulation of genes involved in oncogenesis (e.g. EZH2). Surprisingly few genes are differentially expressed between systemic and cutaneous ALK- ALCL despite their different clinical behaviour, and between ALK- ALCL and cHL despite their different cellular origin.

This study investigated the possibility of treating esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) cells by inhibitors of broad and specific histone deacetylases (HDACi; SAHA, MS-275, FK228) and/or of DNMT (Azacytidine, AZA).Drug targets (HDAC1,2,3 and DNMT1) were present in non-neoplastic (HET-1A), ESCC (OE21) and EAC (OE33) cell lines. All cell lines responded to HDACi by reduced HDAC activity and increased histone acetylation as well as to AZA by up-regulation of p21. Expression of drug targets remained largely unaffected by HDACi and AZA treatment. Importantly, cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle dynamics and DNA damage were only affected by HDACi and/or AZA in ESCC and EAC, but not the non-neoplastic cells. This was specifically seen for the combination of MS-275 and AZA, leading to enhanced cancer cell selectivity and drug efficiency. By transcriptome analyses of MS-275, AZA and MS-275/AZA treated cells, known (e.g. p21) as well as novel regulated genes significantly associated with the cellular effects post HDACi and/or AZA treatment in ESCC and EAC cells were identified. Finally, human EC tissue specimens frequently expressed the actionable drug targets HDAC1/2/3 and DNMT1.In summary, a combined HDACi (MS-275)/AZA treatment is cancer cell selective and efficient in vitro. Since the majority of ECs express the drug targets in situ, this paves the way for further investigations of HDACi/AZA treatment in esophageal cancer cells and their translation into a clinico-pathological setting. To elucidate the transcriptome response to HDAC inhibitors of normal esophageal cells and esophageal tumor cells, total RNA was isolated from non-neoplastic esophageal epithelial cells (Het1A cells) a well as from two esophageal tumor cell lines (OE21 and OE33), respectively.

Background & Aims: Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a rare primary hepatic cancer usually developed in non-cirrhotic livers of children and young adults with unknown etiology. Treatment is limited to surgical intervention. To date, molecular pathogenesis of FLC has been poorly characterized. Herein, we aim to provide an integrative genomic analysis from a large series of FLC patients. Methods: A clinically annotated cohort of 77 FLCs was analyzed through whole transcriptome, SNP-array and whole-exome sequencing. Non-negative matrix factorization was performed for class discovery, and GSEA, NTP, IPA and immunohistochemistry for functional annotation. GISTIC algorithm identified chromosomal aberrations; Mutect and VarScan2, somatic mutations, and Random survival forest the prognostic signature, validated in an independent cohort. Results: Unsupervised gene expression clustering revealed 3 robust molecular classes: Proliferation-51%, enriched with liver cancer proliferation signatures and mTOR signaling activation, Inflammation-26%, with pro-inflammatory cytokines signatures, and Unannotated-23%, with non-liver-related cancer signatures. Neuroendocrine genes and cholangiocyte and hepatocyte histological markers were present in all classes. FLC showed few copy number variations, being the most frequent: focal amplification at 8q24.3(12.5%), and deletions at 19p13(28%) and 22q13.32(25%). DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript was observed in 79% of cases. FLC tumors had 32 damaging mutations on average, affecting uncommon genes in liver neoplasms (BRCA2, U2AF1). An 8-gene prognostic signature predicted survival in FLC patients. Conclusions: FLC genomic analysis reveals a unique molecular portrait characterized by uncommon damaging mutations and chromosomal aberrations, and a highly prevalent fusion protein. Three molecular classes, including Proliferation and Inflammation, define the biological behavior. Prognostic signature will allow better patient stratification.

The use of integrated approaches in genetic toxicology, including the incorporation of gene expression data to determine the molecular pathways involved in the response, is becoming more common. In a companion paper, a genomic biomarker was developed in human TK6 cells to classify chemicals as genotoxic or non-genotoxic. Because TK6 cells are not metabolically competent, we set out to broaden the utility of the biomarker for use with chemicals requiring metabolic activation. Specifically, chemical exposures were conducted in the presence of rat liver S9. The ability of the biomarker to classify genotoxic (benzo[a]pyrene, BaP; aflatoxin B1, AFB1) and non-genotoxic (dexamethasone, DEX; phenobarbital, PB) agents correctly was evaluated. Cells were exposed to increasing chemical concentrations for 4h and collected 0h, 4h and 20h post-exposure. Relative survival, apoptosis, and micronucleus frequency were measured at 24h. Transcriptome profiles were measured with Agilent microarrays. Statistical modeling and bioinformatics tools were applied to classify each chemical using the genomic biomarker. BaP and AFB1 were correctly classified as genotoxic at the mid- and high concentrations at all three time points, whereas DEX was correctly classified as non-genotoxic at all concentrations and time points. The high concentration of PB was misclassified at 24h, suggesting that cytotoxicity at later time points may cause misclassification. The data suggest that the use of S9 does not impair the ability of the biomarker to classify genotoxicity in TK6 cells. Finally, we demonstrate that the biomarker is also able to accurately classify genotoxicity using a publicly available dataset derived from human HepaRG cells. This experiment examined the whole genome transcriptional response of TK6 cells exposed to Dexamethasone for 4 hours followed by a 0h, 4h and 20h recovery in fresh media (4h, 8h, and 24h time points, respectively) at 2 different concentrations, including 0.63 mM and 1mM, in addition to negative controls (+-S9), vehicle controls (+-S9) and a direct-acting positive control, cisplatin (-S9) at 24 mg/ml (PC-24).

MCF-7:PF is a a new in vitro model of antihormone resistant breast cancer that exhibits the characteristics of acquired tamoxifen resistance in vivo.It is well known that estrogen (E2) induces apoptosis in long-term estrogen-deprived breast cancer cells, MCF-7:5C (PubMed References PMID:15862958, PMID:16333030). MCF-7:PF was derived from MCF-7:5C through inhibition of c-Src, which blocks E2-induced apoptosis, coverts E2 responses from apoptosis to proliferation. MCF-7:PF cell growth is stimulated by E2 and SERMS in an ERa-dependent manner.Abstract: A c-Src inhibitor blocks estrogen (E2)-induced stress and converts E2 responses from inducing apoptosis to stimulating growth in E2-deprived breast cancer cells. A resulting cell line, MCF-7:PF, is reprogrammed with features of functional estrogen receptor (ER) and over-expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor beta (IGF-1Rb). We addressed the question of whether the antiestrogenic selective ER modulator 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) could target ER to prevent E2-stimulated growth in MCF-7:PF cells. Unexpectedly, 4-OHT stimulated cell growth in an ER-dependent manner. However, unlike E2, 4-OHT suppressed classic ER-target genes as does the pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780, even during growth stimulation. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay indicated that 4-OHT did not recruit ER or nuclear receptor coactivator 3 (SRC3) to the promoter of ER-target gene, pS2. Paradoxically, 4-OHT reduced total IGF-1Rb but increased phosphorylation of IGF-1Rb, which was responsible for the activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway. Mechanistic studies revealed that 4-OHT rapidly activated the non-genomic pathway through ER, but other membrane-associated proteins such as IGF-1Rb and c-Src participated. Furthermore, 4-OHT was more potent than E2 to up-regulate membrane remodeling molecules and activated focal adhesion molecules to promote cell growth. Therefore, disruption of membrane-associated signaling completely abolished 4-OHT-stimulated cell growth, but not E2-stimulated cell growth. Despite continued suppression of classic ER-target genes, 4-OHT activated the complex network of cytoskeleton remodeling and extracellular matrix-related signaling which facilitated 4-OHT-stimulated cell growth. This study is the first to recapitulate a cellular model in vitro of acquired tamoxifen (TAM) resistance developed in athymic mice in vivo. MCF-7:PF cells were treated with E2, 4-OHT, ICI 182,780, and combinations of E2 or 4-OHT with ICI 182,780 to examine ER-dependent and independent gene regulation patterns by E2 and 4-OHT.",

Purpose: Chronic pulmonary inflammation in the form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been consistently shown to increase the risk of lung cancer. Therefore, identification of chemopreventive agents with anti-inflammatory effects, in addition to antiproliferative and apoptotic activities, is indispensable. Recently, we found that combinations of silibinin (Sil) and indole-3-carbinol (I3C) significantly inhibited lung tumorigenesis induced by 4-(methylnitro-samino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and enhanced by chronic treatment with the inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this study, we described gene expression profiling of lung tissues using RNA-seq to determine the gene expression signature in inflammation-driven lung tumors and modulation of this signature by the chemopreventive agents Sil and I3C.Methods: Total RNA extracted from lung tissues of control and treated mice were processed for mRNA sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed for transcript abundance at the gene level using CLC Bio Genomics Workbench and differential gene expression analysis was performed using the built-in Empirical Analysis of Differential Gene Expression (DGE) based on 'Exact Test' method. qRT-PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays.Results and conclusions: We found that 330, 2,957, and 1,143 genes were differentially regulated in mice treated with NNK, LPS, and NNK + LPS, respectively. The expression of inflammation-and immunity-related genes was significantly more deregulated in lung tissues of mice treated with LPS alone compared to mice treated with NNK + LPS. Among 1,143 genes differentially regulated in the NNK + LPS group, the expression of 162 genes and associated signaling pathways were significantly modulated by I3C and/or Sil + I3C. These genes include cytokines, chemokines, and genes with a well-established role in inflammation and/or tumorigenesis such as c-ros oncogene 1 (Ros1), the EGFR ligands amphiregulin and epiregulin, Cyp1a1, and the circadian rhythm genes Arntl, and Npas2.

The ets transcription factor ELF5 specifies the differentiation of mammary progenitor cells to establish the milk-secreting lineage. ER- and poor prognosis basal breast cancers arise from this progenitor cell and these cancers express high levels of Elf5. Knockdown of ELF5 expression in basal breast cancer cell lines, or forced expression in luminal breast cancer cell lines, resulted in reduced cell proliferation. Transcript profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that the transcriptional activity of ELF5 specified the gene expression patterns that distinguish basal from luminal breast cancer, including suppression of FOXA1, GATA3 and ER, key estrogen-action genes. Tamoxifen treatment of luminal MCF7 cells upregulated Elf5 expression and cells that acquired resistance to Tamoxifen became dependent on ELF5 for proliferation. ELF5 is a regulator of breast cancer cell proliferation, transcriptionally specifies the basal molecular subtype and is utilised by ER+ breast cancer cells to escape proliferative arrest caused by Tamoxifen. Elf5 was knocked down via siRNA in basal HCC1937 cell lines, in triplicate. Elf5 was induced in luminal T47D and MCF7 cell lines via a doxycycline inducible expression vector, in duplicate.",

To test the hypotheses that mutant huntingtin protein length and wild-type huntingtin dosage have important effects on disease-related transcriptional dysfunction, we compared the changes in mRNA in seven genetic mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD) and postmortem human HD caudate. Transgenic models expressing short N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin (R6/1 and R6/2 mice) exhibited the most rapid effects on gene expression, consistent with previous studies. Although changes in the brains of knock-in and full-length transgenic models of HD took longer to appear, 15- and 22-month CHL2(Q150/Q150), 18-month Hdh(Q92/Q92) and 2-year-old YAC128 animals also exhibited significant HD-like mRNA signatures. Whereas it was expected that the expression of full-length huntingtin transprotein might result in unique gene expression changes compared with those caused by the expression of an N-terminal huntingtin fragment, no discernable differences between full-length and fragment models were detected. In addition, very high correlations between the signatures of mice expressing normal levels of wild-type huntingtin and mice in which the wild-type protein is absent suggest a limited effect of the wild-type protein to change basal gene expression or to influence the qualitative disease-related effect of mutant huntingtin. The combined analysis of mouse and human HD transcriptomes provides important temporal and mechanistic insights into the process by which mutant huntingtin kills striatal neurons. In addition, the discovery that several available lines of HD mice faithfully recapitulate the gene expression signature of the human disorder provides a novel aspect of validation with respect to their use in preclinical therapeutic trials.Keywords: genetic modification.

Adipogenesis is induced by treating confluent preadipocytes with the adipogenic cocktail, which activates transcription factors (TFs) glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and CREB within minutes and increases expression of TFs C/EBPb/d, KLF4 and Krox20 within hours. All of these TFs have been shown to be capable of promoting adipogenesis in culture when they are overexpressed. However, it has remained unclear whether endogenous KLF4 and Krox20 are required for adipogenesis in culture and in vivo. Using conditional knockout mice and derived white and brown preadipocytes, we show that endogenous KLF4 and Krox20 are dispensable for adipogenesis in culture and brown adipose tissue development in mice. In contrast, the master adipogenic TF PPARg is essential. These results challenge the existing model on transcriptional regulation in the early phase of adipogenesis and highlight the need of studying adipogenesis in vivo.

MicroRNAs (miRs) function primarily as post-transcriptional negative regulators of gene expression through binding to their mRNA targets. Reliable prediction of a miR's targets is a considerable bioinformatic challenge of great importance for inferring the miR's function. Sequence-based prediction algorithms have high false-positive rates, are not in agreement, and are not biological context specific. Here we introduce CoSMic (Context-Specific MicroRNA analysis), an algorithm that combines sequence-based prediction with miR and mRNA expression data. CoSMic differs from existing methods--it identifies miRs that play active roles in the specific biological system of interest and predicts with less false positives their functional targets. We applied CoSMic to search for miRs that regulate the migratory response of human mammary cells to epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Several such miRs, whose putative targets were significantly enriched by migration processes were identified. We tested three of these miRs experimentally, and showed that they indeed affected the migratory phenotype; we also tested three negative controls. In comparison to other algorithms CoSMic indeed filters out false positives and allows improved identification of context-specific targets. CoSMic can greatly facilitate miR research in general and, in particular, advance our understanding of individual miRs' function in a specific context. MCF10A cells were transfected using Oligofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen), with siRNA oligonucleotides directed at hsa-miR-20a, hsa-miR-671-5p and a non-targeting control (purchased from Dharmacon).

Breast cancer cells display preferences for specific metastatic sites including the bone, lung and liver. Metastasis is a complex process that relies, in part, on interactions between disseminated cancer cells and resident/infiltrating stromal cells that constitute the metastatic microenvironment. Distinct immune infiltrates can either impair the metastatic process or conversely, assist in the seeding, colonization and growth of disseminated cancer cells. Using in vivo selection approaches, we previously isolated 4T1-derived breast cancer cells that preferentially metastasize to these organs and tissues. In this study, we examined whether the propensity of breast cancer cells to metastasize to the lung, liver or bone is associated with and dependent on distinct patterns of immune cell infiltration. Immunohistocytochemistry and immunohistofluorescence approaches were used to quantify granulocytic infiltrates within distinct metastases and depletion of Gr1+ cells was performed to functionally interrogate the role of myeloid/granulocytic infiltrates in promoting metastasis to these organs.We show that T lymphocytes (CD3+), myeloid-derived/granulocytic cells (Gr-1+) cells and neutrophils (NE+) exhibit the most pronounced recruitment in lung and liver metastases, with markedly less recruitment within bone metastatic lesions. Interestingly, these infiltrating cell populations display different patterns of localization within soft tissue metastases. T lymphocytes and neutrophils are localized around the periphery of liver metastases whereas they were dispersed throughout the lung metastases. Furthermore, Gr-1+ cell-depletion studies demonstrate that infiltrating myeloid-derived/granulocytic cells, including neutrophils, are essential for the formation of breast cancer liver metastases but dispensable for metastasis to the lung and bone. Finally, we demonstrate that neutrophils that infiltrate and surround the liver metastases are polarized towards an N2 phenotype, which have previously been shown to enhance tumor growth and metastasis. Our results demonstrate that the liver metastatic potential of breast cancer cells is heavily reliant on interactions with infiltrating myeloid/granulocytic cells in the liver microenvironment.

Dysregulated lipid metabolism is an oncogenic mechanism that leads to increased de novo fatty acid biosynthesis via elevated expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN) in cancer. FASN catalyzes biosynthesis of (C16) palmitic acid by using Acetyl CoA, malonyl CoA and NADPH as substrates. Palmitic acid and its derivatives participate as signaling lipids andinvolved in the regulation of receptor functions associated with many biological processes. and furtherThis includes contribute formation of cell structures, and all these processes which are essential for both normal and malignant cell growth and proliferation. In this study, we investigated the biological impact of FASN inhibition in B cell Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (bNHL) cells using FASN inhibitors Cerulenin and other novel agents (TVB3166, TVB3567). Inhibition of FASN resulted in a dose dependent increase in cell death and apoptosis in the bNHL and primary tumor cells. Transcriptomic and comprehensive systems biology analysis of cerulenin, TVB3166 or TVB3567 treated bNHL cells revealed conserved activation of (TNF) immune and PI3K signaling, and inhibition of cell cycle pathways as prominent responses to FASN inhibition. Cell fractionation and western blot analysis of cCerulenin treated cells showed translocation of TNF receptor adaptor proteins (TRAF2 and RIP), docking of AKT and PI3K/p110 subunits to cell membrane and activation of PI3K/AKT pathways by phosphorylation in SUDHL2 and SUDHL4 bNHL cells, while these mechanisms were constitutively active in cerulenin treated SUDHL10 bNHL cells. Disruption of lipid raft formation by methyl b cyclodextrin inhibited PI3K signaling and downregulated FASN expression in SUDHL10 cells. Subsequently, we observed that combination of FASN (cerulenin) and PI3K (Buparlisib) inhibitors resulted in synergistic cell death in bNHL cell lines and increased apoptosis accompanied with down-regulation of FASN expression in bNHL cell lines and primary cells, implicating the importance of PI3K in the regulation of lipid metabolism. Further mass spectrometric evaluation of cerulenin and Buparlisib treated DLBCL cells fed with C14C glucose, synergistically decreased the biosynthesis of palmitic acid and its derivatives compared to single agent treatments. Our conclusions from these investigations suggest that simultaneous blocking of PI3K and FASN is likely to exert stronger inhibition of lipid metabolism and enhance cell death in lymphoma. For genome-wide expression profiling of SUDHL2, SUHDL10, and Raji cells treated with 12.5uM Cerulenin and IC50 drug concentrations for TVB3567 and TVB3166 for 48 hours, Human HT-12 BeadArray chips (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were used.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a serious global health problem characterized by chronic airway inflammation, progressive airflow limitation and destruction of lung parenchyma. Remodeling of the bronchial airways in COPD includes changes in both the bronchial epithelium and the subepithelial extracellular matrix (ECM). To explore the impact of an aberrant ECM on epithelial cell phenotype in COPD we developed a new ex vivo model, in which normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells repopulate and differentiate on decellularized human bronchial scaffolds derived from COPD patients and healthy individuals. By using transcriptomics, we show that bronchial ECM from COPD patients induces differential gene expression in primary NHBE cells when compared to normal bronchial ECM. The gene expression profile indicated altered activity of upstream mediators associated with COPD pathophysiology, including hepatocyte growth factor, transforming growth factor beta 1 and platelet-derived growth factor B, which suggests that COPD-related changes in the bronchial ECM contribute to the defective regenerative ability in the airways of COPD patients. Normal bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells were seeded on decellularized bronchial scaffolds from 3 COPD patients and 3 healthy donors. Differentiation was induced 4 days later and repopulated scaffolds were collected after 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days of differentiation.",

Background: The development of a new drug from candidate to market is a complex process requiring vast resources of time, money and personnel. The rate of failure in the development pipeline is enormous, leading to wasted resources that could have been better employed on alternative candidates. The requirement for early stage prediction of toxicity is, then, of paramount importance to expedite the introduction of new therapies to clinical practice. To date, most transcriptomics efforts to solve this problem have applied Support Vector Machine techniques to data derived from in vivo studies in rats.Results: We applied a toxicogenomics approach to determine whether known renal toxicants could be identified as such from their effects on the transcriptome of the human renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line, HK-2. Based on clustering of differentially expressed genes, we identified 3 toxicity groups within the set of compounds. We used Random Forest to generate a classifier to accurately place compounds in groups. The classifier is based on a signature biomarker comprising 21 genes identified by Random Forest and could differentiate between the groups with high accuracy. Furthermore, we could correctly classify external samples from a dataset exhibiting a marked 'batch effect'.Conclusions: No toxicity-associated gene expression alterations could be identified across a set of toxic compounds. Random Forest is a suitable technique for the classification of compounds into toxicity groups. Using a measure of differential expression rather than expression level per se generates a robust classifier that can potentially be applied in a platform-independent manner. Gene expression changes in HK-2 cells were measured following exposure to 9 different compounds over a range of doses and time-points with the aim of finding biological signatures of toxicity. Clustering of the resulting gene expression data revealed 3 groups of nephrotoxic compounds (Tox 1, Tox 2 and Tox 3), each exhibiting their own distinct effect on HK-2 cells.This study measures gene expression changes following exposure to a high dose of Kbr or a control over 24 hrs or 48 hrs.

Similar to cells of the blastocyst, resulting naive cells exhibited two active X-chromosomes with XIST expression and chromosome-wide transcriptional dampening, and initiated XIST-mediated X-inactivation upon differentiation. Both establishment and exit from the naive state (differentiation) happened via an XIST-negative XaXa intermediate.

JNK1 has been shown to regulate BCL2 expression thereby altering leukemogenesis, but the impact of c-JUN remained unclear. In this study we show that JNK1 and c-JUN promote leukemogenesis via separate pathways, since lack of c-JUN impairs proliferation of p185BCR-ABL transformed cells without affecting viability. The decreased proliferation of c-JunD/D cells is associated with the loss of cyclin dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) expression. In c-JunD/D cells CDK6 expression becomes down-regulated upon BCR-ABL induced transformation which correlates with CpG island methylation within the 5' region of Cdk6. We verified the impact of Cdk6 deficiency by using Cdk6-/- mice that developed BCR-ABL induced B-lymphoid leukemia with significantly increased latency and an attenuated disease phenotype. In addition we show that re-expression of CDK6 in BCR-ABL transformed c-JunD/D cells reconstitutes proliferation and tumor formation in Nu/Nu mice. In summary, our study reveals a novel function for the AP-1 transcription factor c-JUN in leukemogenesis by antagonizing promoter methylation. Moreover, we identify CDK6 as relevant and critical target of AP-1 regulated DNA methylation upon BCR-ABL induced transformation, thereby accelerating leukemogenesis. Overall, 8 samples consisting of 4 wild type and 4 c-jun knock out samples were hybridized to MoGene-1_0-st-v1 microarrays.",

Obesity causes insulin resistance, and PPARg ligands like rosiglitazone (rosi) are insulin-sensitizing, yet mechanisms remain unclear. High fat diet (HFD) induced obesity has major effects on visceral epididymal adipose tissue (eWAT) of C57BL/6 (B6) mice, and here we report altered activity of gene regulatory elements with changes in PPARg genome-wide occupancy. Treatment with rosi restored insulin sensitivity, yet surprisingly had little effect on eWAT, leading us to consider the subcutaneous inguinal fat (iWAT). In this depot, rosi markedly induced molecular signatures of brown fat including the key thermogenic gene Ucp1. Obesity-resistant 129S1/SvImJ (129) mice showed this degree of iWAT browning even in the absence of rosi. Remarkably, the 129 Ucp1 locus had increased PPARg binding and gene expression that was preserved in B6x129 F1 intercross iWAT, with imbalance favoring the 129-derived alleles showing a cis-acting genetic difference. Thus, B6 mice have a genetic defect in Ucp1 expression. However, imbalanced expression favoring 129 over B6 was nearly lost when Ucp1 was activated by rosi, or by iWAT browning in cold-exposed or young mice. These results provide a novel framework for understanding how environmental influences like drugs can rescue genetically determined disease phenotypes by affecting the epigenome. C57BL/6J and 129S1/SvlmJ mice were on LFD or HFD; then treated with rosiglitazone.",

    "text": "Comparison of gene expression response to neutron and x-ray irradiation using mouse blood. Background: In the event of an improvised nuclear device detonation, the prompt radiation exposure would consist of g rays plus a neutron component that would contribute to the total dose. As neutrons cause more complex and difficult to repair damage to cells that would result in more severe health burden to affected individuals, it is paramount to be able to estimate the contribution of neutrons to an estimated dose, to provide information for those making treatment decisions.Results: Mice exposed to either 0.25 or 1 Gy of neutron or 1 or 4 Gy x-ray radiation were sacrificed at 1 or 7 days after exposure. Whole genome microarray analysis identified 7,285 and 5,045 differentially expressed genes in the blood of mice exposed to neutron or x-ray radiation, respectively. Neutron exposure resulted in mostly downregulated genes, whereas x-rays showed both down- and up-regulated genes. A total of 34 differentially expressed genes were regulated in response to all >=1 Gy exposures at both times. Of these, 25 genes were consistently downregulated at days 1 and 7, whereas 9 genes, including the transcription factor E2f2, showed bi-directional regulation; being downregulated at day 1, while upregulated at day 7. Gene ontology analysis revealed that genes involved in nucleic acid metabolism processes were persistently downregulated in neutron irradiated mice, whereas genes involved in lipid metabolism were upregulated in x-ray irradiated animals. Most biological processes significantly enriched at both timepoints were consistently represented by either under- or over-expressed genes. In contrast, cell cycle processes were significant among down-regulated genes at day 1, but among up-regulated genes at day 7 after exposure to either neutron or x-rays. Cell cycle genes downregulated at day 1 were mostly distinct from the cell cycle genes upregulated at day 7. However, five cell cycle genes, Fzr1, Ube2c, Ccna2, Nusap1, and Cdc25b, were both downregulated at day 1 and upregulated at day 7.Conclusions: We describe, for the first time, the gene expression profile of mouse blood cells following exposure to neutrons. We have found that neutron radiation results in both distinct and common gene expression patterns compared with x-ray radiation. Radiation induced gene expression in mouse blood was measured at 1, 3, and 7 days after 0.25 Gy and 1 Gy neutron exposure or after 1 Gy and 4 Gy of x-rays.

Abstract: Epigenetic alterations are a fundamental aspect of cancer cells, and epigenetic drugs are currently used in clinical practice for hematological malignancies. Pediatric neuro-ectodermal tumors originate from neural crest cells and show epigenetic defects of apoptotic pathways, which makes the introduction of epigenetic drugs in this patient category logical. However, the young age of these patients is accompanied by ongoing developmental processes which are regulated epigenetic mechanisms, and prompted us to study molecular effects of nanomolar dosage epigenetic drugs in neuro-ectodermal tumor cell lines. Combination treatment of 5-aza-2'-deoxicytidine (DAC) and Trichostatin A (TSA) at nanomolar dosages resulted in wide-spread demethylating effects in 17 NBL and 5 PNET cell lines in vitro. This widespread demethylation had large effects on gene-expression profiles. In NBL cell lines, almost every cellular pathway (193/200) investigated demonstrated altered expression upon treatment, and resulted in upregulation of known epigenetically regulated genes such as X-chromosomal, tissue-specific, and a few imprinted genes. Integration analysis of CpG island methylation array data and whole genome gene expression data identified 30 genes potentially upregulated by gene promoter demethylation. Homeobox genes frequently showed demethylation in both short term (72 hours) and long term cultures (3 months) of NBL lines. Continuous treatment with epigenetic drugs resulted in low rates of proliferation. The low rate of proliferation that might explain limited consecutive demethylation upon prolonged exposure. In conclusion, genome-wide methylation and gene expression changes are induced DAC and TSA treatment at nanomolar dosages. These effects affected more than 97% of cellular pathways investigated. Further studies towards the effects of epigenetic drug combinations are advised before being applied in clinical trials for pediatric patients.

    "text": "Effect of two weeks erythropoietin treatment on monocyte transcriptomes of cardiorenal patients. Patients with combined heart and renal failure, also termed the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS), have high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Several key connectors between heart and kidney have been recognized, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system. Monocytes are key players in the development of atherosclerosis and may act as a biosensor to detect changes in the systemic environment. Anemia, which occurs frequently in CRS, is partly due to an absolute and/or relative erythropoietin (EPO) deficiency. Until now, EPO treatment has largely been used to treat (renal) anemia, but recent research also showed beneficial non-hematopoietic effects such as anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative capacities. The hypothesis of the present study was that monocyte gene expression profiles of cardiorenal patients compared to healthy controls reflect the systemic nature of CRS and are responsive to short-term treatment with Epo. The first aim was to investigate whether this short term treatment revealed non-hematopoietic EPO effects. The second aim was to address whether EPO dampens expression of genes involved in inflammation and oxidative stress. Given the variable response to EPO, the third aim was to test whether baseline gene expression profiles or the acute gene expression modulation by EPO are associated with EPO resistance. This study was part of a larger clinical trial in which hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic effects of EPO treatment for short and long term are assessed in CRS patients. Therefore, patients were randomized into 3 groups: (1) EPO, patients are kept on baseline low hemoglobin levels by phlebotomy for 6 months; (2) EPO, patients may rise in hemoglobin levels to defined maximum for 6 months; (3) No EPO. This gene expression analysis is focussed on EPO's short-term (2wk) effects in a subset of included patients. Group (1) and (2) were grouped for analysis, since both groups received EPO and no phlebotomy had been performed in the first 2 weeks. Monocytes were positively isolated from peripheral whole blood with CD14+ immunomagnetic beads. Total RNA was isolated and prepared for genome wide analyses using Illumina HumanRef8 V3.0 Beadchips. In total, 48 arrays were analyzed including 12 healthy controls, 18 CRS patients at baseline and 2 weeks after study enrollment. Twelve out of 18 patients received EPO during the two weeks.The supplementary file 'GSE17582_non-normalized_data.txt' contains non-normalized data for Samples GSM438053-GSM438100.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are tightly regulated in the immune system, as aberrant expression of miRNAs often results in hematopoietic malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Previously, elevated levels of miR-27 in T cells isolated from multiple sclerosis patients has been suggested to facilitate disease progression through inhibiting Th2 immunity and promoting pathogenic Th1 responses. Here we demonstrate that while mice with T cell-specific overexpression of miR-27 harbor dysregulated Th1 responses and develop autoimmune pathology, these disease phenotypes are not driven by miR-27 in effector T cells in a cell-autonomous manner but rather resulted from a perturbed regulatory T (Treg) cell compartment. Excessive miR-27 expression in T cells severely impairs Treg cell differentiation. Moreover, Treg cells with exaggerated miR-27-mediated gene regulation exhibit diminished homeostasis and suppressor function in vivo. Mechanistically, miR-27 represses several known as well as previously uncharacterized targets that play critical roles in controlling multiple aspects of Treg cell biology. Collectively, our data show miR-27 functions as a key regulator in Treg cell development and function and suggest that proper regulation of miR-27 is pivotal to safeguard Treg cell-mediated immunological tolerance.

To clarify its cellular origin and the mechanisms of tumorigenesis, we used ex vivo approach to create a murine model for Ewing's sarcoma. The osteochondrogenic progenitors derived from the facial zone (FZ) of murine long bones at late gestation were purified by microdissection, introduced with EWS-FLI1 or EWS-ERG retroviruses and transplanted into nude mice. Ewing's sarcoma-like small round cell sarcoma developed at 100% penetrance, whereas tumor induction was less effective when growth place (GP)-derived cells were used. The different response of gene expression to EWS-FLI1 between FZ and GP cells suggests importance of the specific cellular context for EWS-FLI1 to induce Ewing's sarcoma. The Wnt/b-catenin pathway was involved in close relationship to the cellular context, with Dkk2 and Wipf1 as important downstream modulators. Furthermore, gene expression profiling revealed similarity between our models and human Ewing's sarcoma. These results indicate that Ewing's sarcoma originates from the embryonic osteochondrogenic progenitor.

Translation is a fundamental biological process and ribosomes are essential in all cells, but defects in ribosome biogenesis (ribosomopathies) disproportionately cause hematopoietic dysfunction of red blood cells and platelets. Here, we analyze translation in primary human reticulocytes and platelets by ribosome profiling and uncover dramatic accumulation of post-termination, unrecycled ribosomes in the 3'UTRs of mRNAs. We then demonstrate that these ribosomes accumulate as a result of the natural loss of the ribosome recycling factor ABCE1 during terminal differentiation. We find that induction of ribosome rescue factors PELO and HBS1L is required to maintain translational homeostasis when ABCE1 levels fall. This activation of ribosome rescue mitigates the effects of ribosome shortage on translational output, including on hemoglobin production. Our observations suggest that this distinctive loss of ABCE1 in anucleate blood lineages sensitizes them to defects in ribosome homeostasis and that activation of a ribosome rescue pathway plays a lineage-specific role in maintaining ribosome homeostasis during blood cell development.

    "text": "Smoking Dysregulates the Human Airway Basal Cell Transcriptome at COPD-linked Risk Locus 19q13.2. Rationale: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and candidate gene studies have identified a number of loci linked to susceptibility of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a smoking-related disorder that originates in the airway epithelium.Objectives: Since airway basal cell (BC) stem/progenitor cells exhibit the earliest abnormalities associated with smoking (hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia), we hypothesized that smoker BC have a dysregulated transcriptome linked, in part, to known GWAS/candidate gene loci.Methods: Massive parallel RNA sequencing was used to compare the transcriptome of BC purified from the airway epithelium of healthy nonsmokers (n=10) and smokers (n=7). The chromosomal location of the differentially expressed genes was compared to loci identified by GWAS and candidate gene studies to confer risk for COPD.Measurements and Main Results: Smoker BC have 676 known genes differentially expressed compared to nonsmoker BC, dominated by smoking up-regulation. Strikingly, 166 (25%) of these genes are located on chromosome 19, with 13 localized to 19q13.2 (p<10-4 compared to chance), including TGFB1, LTBP4, EGLN2 and NFKBIB, genes associated with risk for COPD.Conclusions: These observations provide the first direct link of known genetic risks for smoking-related lung disease with the specific population of lung cells that undergoes the earliest changes associated with smoking. The human airway basal cell transcriptome of 7 smokers versus 10 nonsmokers was compared using massive parallel RNA sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 2000).",

Bloom syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic instability and cancer predisposition syndrome caused by loss of function mutations in the BLM RECQ helicase gene. To ask if some of the distinctive pathological features of Bloom syndrome might reflect altered gene expression, we analyzed global mRNA and miRNA expression in fibroblasts from 16 patients and 15 matched normal controls, and in control primary diploid fibroblasts depleted of the BLM protein. We document significant differential expression of both protein-coding genes and miRNAs with well-characterized cancer associations in BLM-deficient cells. Differences in expression correlated significantly with G4 motifs, which are associated with potential to form G-quadruplex structures. These results indicate that BLM helicase may modulate gene expression by regulating the in vivo stability of G-quadruplex structures, and identify sets of genes and miRNAs whose expression, when altered, may drive the pathogenesis of Bloom syndrome and associated cancers.

We investigated expression profiling of whole blood cells to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the effectiveness of IFX therapy and to find characteristic biomarker and an important target in refractory KD. Methods: Refractory KD patients who failed to respond to repeated intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) infusions had received a single infusion of IFX as third therapy.

Translatome analysis by sucrose gradient centrifugation of cell lysates followed by microarray profiling of the polysomal and subpolysomal RNA fractions represents a way of both studying translational control networks and better approximating the proteomic representation of cells. It is an established notion that translational control takes place essentially at the translation initiation level, therefore the variation in abundance of a given mRNA species on polysomes can be directly related to the variation in abundance of the corresponding protein. Comparison of translatome profile changes with corresponding transcriptome profile changes can provide a measure of the degree of concordance between cellular controls affecting mRNA abundance and cellular controls affecting mRNA availability to translation. To provide a direct experimental evaluation of the phenomenon, we decided to study a classical example of transcriptional reprogramming of gene expression: Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) treatment. This stimulus triggers a well known chain of intracellular transduction events, ultimately resulting in a multifaceted phenotypic spectrum of changes with prevalent induction of cell growth and proliferation. We subjected HeLa cells to serum starvation for 12h and then we added EGF at final concentration of 1 mg/ml, profiling before and after 40 minutes of treatment the transcriptome, the translatome, coming from the polysomal pool of mRNAs after sucrose gradient separation, and also the mRNA content of the subpolysomal pool, expected not to be actively translated.Keywords: translatome profiling, polysomal profiling, polysomal RNA, translational control, translational profiling, polysome profiling, post-transcriptional regulation, EGF starvation release. .

IRAK-4 is an essential component of the signal transduction complex downstream of the IL-1- and Toll-like receptors. Though regarded as the first kinase in the signaling cascade, the role of IRAK-4 kinase activity versus its scaffold function is still controversial. In order to investigate the role of IRAK-4 kinase function in vivo, 'knock-in' mice were generated by replacing the wild type IRAK-4 gene with a mutant gene encoding kinase deficient IRAK-4 protein (IRAK-4 KD). Analysis of bone marrow macrophages obtained from WT and IRAK-4 KD mice with a number of experimental techniques demonstrated that the IRAK-4 KD cells greatly lack responsiveness to stimulation with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist LPS. One of the techniques used, microarray analysis, identified IRAK-4 kinase-dependent LPS response genes and revealed that the induction of LPS-responsive mRNAs was largely ablated in IRAK-4 KD cells. In summary, our results suggest that IRAK-4 kinase activity plays a critical role in TLR4-mediated induction of inflammatory responses.Keywords: genetic modification, strain comparison, cell stimulation, time course, anti-bacterial response, innate immune response, inflammatory response. The response of mouse bone marrow macrophages from WT and IRAK4 kinase dead animals to stimulation with LPS at two time points was determined.

How retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells degenerate from oxidative stress in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is incompletely understood. The study's intent was to identify key cytoprotective pathways activated by oxidative stress, and to determine the extent of their protection. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify the unfolded protein response (UPR) and mitochondria in the RPE of AMD samples. Maculas with early AMD had prominent IRE1a, but minimal mitochondrial TOM20 immunolabeling in mildly degenerated RPE. RPE cells treated with cigarette smoke extract (CSE), by microarray analysis, had over-represented genes involved in the antioxidant and unfolded protein response, and mitochondrial location. CSE induced the UPR sensors IRE1a, p-PERK, and ATP6, which activated CHOP. CHOP knockdown compromised cell viability after CSE exposure. At the same CSE doses, mitochondria generated superoxide anion and produced less ATP. In mice given intravitreal CSE, the RPE had increased IRE1a and decreased ATP, which elicited RPE epithelial-mesenchymal transition, as suggested by altered ZO1 immunolabeling of RPE flatmounts. Our experiments indicate that RPE cells exposed to oxidative stress respond with a cytoprotective antioxidant and unfolded protein response, but develop mitochondrial impairment that contributed to epithelial mesenchymal transition. With similar responses in the RPE of early AMD samples, these results suggest that mitochondria are vulnerable to oxidative stress while the ER elicits a protective response during early AMD.

Arterial smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) undergo phenotypic changes during development and pathological processes in vivo and during cell culture in vitro. Our previous studies demonstrated that retrovirally-mediated expression of the versican V3 splice variant (V3) that lacks glycosaminoglycan chains by ASMCs retards cell proliferation and migration in vitro and reduces neointimal thickening, macrophage and lipid accumulation in animal models of vascular injury and atherosclerosis. However, the molecular pathways induced by V3 expression that are responsible for these changes are not yet clear. In the present study, we employed a microarray approach to examine how expression of V3 induced changes in gene expression and the molecular pathways in ASMCs. We found that forced expression of V3 by ASMCs affected expression of 521 genes by more than 1.5 fold. Gene ontology (GO) analysis shows that components of extracellular matrix were the most significantly affected by V3 expression, indicating that V3 expression elicits profound remodeling of extracellular matrix. In addition, genes regulating the formation of the cytoskeleton which also serve as markers of contractile smooth muscle cells were significantly upregulated. On the other hand, components of the complement system, chemokines, chemokine receptors, and transcription factors crucial for regulating inflammatory processes were among the genes most downregulated. Consistently, we found that the level of myocardin, a key transcription factor promoting contractile ASMC phenotype, was greatly increased while proinflammatory transcription factors NFkappaB1 and C/EBPb were significantly attenuated in V3-expressing SMCs. Such results indicate that V3 expression reprograms ASMC into differentiated and anti-inflammatory phenotypes. Overall, these findings demonstrate that expression of V3 reprograms ASMCs promoting anti-inflammatory and differentiated smooth muscle cell phenotypes potentially by altering cell-ECM interaction and focal adhesion signaling pathways. Fischer rat ASMCs were transduced with either a retroviral vector expressing the Versican V3 splice variant (LV3SN) or an empty control vector (LXSN) in three independent experiments. In the first experiment, V3 and control transductions were performed with four technical replicates. In the subsequent two experiments, individual transductions were done for the V3 or control treatments. For data analysis, the technical replicates from the first experiment were averaged, and then data from the three experiments was evaluated in a paired manner.",

Using detailed SNP array analysis we have identified patients with impaired cerebellar development and neurological dysfunction who have large deletions in the locus encoding the ATAD3A, ATAD3B and ATAD3C genes. Patient cells with inherited ATAD3 defects display aberrant mitochondrial DNA organization and synthesis associated with disrupted cholesterol metabolism. Moreover drug-induced perturbations of cholesterol metabolism cause mitochondrial DNA disorganization in control cells. The interdependence of mitochondria and cholesterol homeostasis is further corroborated by the presence of mitochondrial DNA aggregation in the genetic cholesterol trafficking disorder Niemann Pick type C disease. Thus, we conclude, mitochondria are fully integrated in the circuitry of cellular cholesterol homeostasis, in which ATAD3 plays a critical role, and the dual problem of perturbed cholesterol homeostasis and mitochndrila dysfunction may be widespread in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. We designed the experiment to compare the expression profiles of cells carrying deletions in the ATAD3 gene cluster (ATAD3CAS & ATAD3F) with that of a normal control cell line. Because we suspected that cholesterol metabolism would be altered by ATAD3 deficiency we also prepared RNA from the same three cell lines treated with a drug, pravastatin, that inhibits the rate limiting step of cholesterol synthesis, to determine if the drug produced similar effects on gene expression to ATAD3 deficiency. In practice, pravastatin had almost no signficant effects (FDR 0.05) on any of the cells and none related to cholesterol homeostasis, indicating the drug does not act at the level of gene expression. This proved convenient as two RNA samples from ATAD3CAS failed QC, but the ATAD3CAS + pravastatin versus control (with or without pravastatin) provided additional replicates and displayed almost identical differences to ATAD3CAS (no drug) vs Control.",

The molecular mechanisms that lead to the cognitive defects characteristic of Down syndrome (DS), the most frequent cause of mental retardation, have remained elusive. Here we use a transgenic DS mouse model to show that DYRK1A gene dosage imbalance deregulates chromosomal clusters of genes located near neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) binding sites. We found that DYRK1A binds the SWI/SNF-complex known to interact with REST/NRSF. Mutation of a REST/NRSF binding site in the promoter of the REST/NRSF target gene L1cam modifies the transcriptional effect of Dyrk1A-dosage imbalance on L1cam. DyrkA dosage imbalance perturbs Rest/Nrsf levels with decreased Rest/Nrsf expression in embryonic neurons and increased expression in adult neurons. We identified a coordinated deregulation of multiple genes that are responsible for the cellular phenotypic traits present in DS such as dendritic growth impairment and microcephaly during prenatal cortex development. Dyrk1a overexpression in primary mouse cortical neurons reduced the neuritic complexity. In the postnatal hippocampus, DYRK1A overexpression suppresses a form of synaptic plasticity that may be sufficient to cause DS cognitive defects. We propose that DYRK1A overexpression-related neuronal gene deregulation generates the brain phenotypic changes that characterize DS, with an accessory role for the gene dosage imbalance of other chromosome 21 genes. Agilent Whole Mouse Genome oligomicroarrays (GEO accession no. GPL2872, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) were used. They contain 60-mer DNA probes synthesized in situ in a 44k format.

A general factor that regulates Mediator function is the four-subunit Mediator kinase module, which contains either CDK8 or CDK19. Whereas CDK8 has been linked to specific signaling cascades and oncogenesis, the cellular roles of its paralog, CDK19, are poorly studied. To define cellular roles for CDK19, we used osteosarcoma cells (SJSA) that naturally lack endogenous CDK8 protein. Although stable CDK19 knockdown was tolerated in SJSA cells, it caused reduced proliferation vs. control shRNA cells. Global gene expression analyses (RNA-Seq) suggested that defects in cholesterol biosynthesis contributed to reduced proliferation in CDK19 knockdown cells (vs. shCTRL). Notably, proliferation defects were rescued with transient expression of wild-type or kinase-dead CDK19. Using RNA-Seq and other assays, we established a general role for CDK19 in the transcriptional response to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), an inducer of genotoxic and metabolic stress. These experiments also implicated CDK19 in activation of p53 target genes during 5-FU treatment. To further probe a potential role for CDK19 in the p53 response, SJSA cells (shCDK19 vs. shCTRL) were treated with the p53 activator Nutlin-3. Remarkably, CDK19 was required for SJSA cells to return to a proliferative state following Nutlin-3 treatment, and this effect was kinase-independent. These results implicate CDK19 as a regulator of p53 stress responses and suggest a manifestation of CDK19 knockdown--potentially reduced levels of cholesterol metabolites--blocks cellular resistance to Nutlin-3. SJSA cells were treated with either 375uM 5-FU or DMSO in biological duplicate for each population (4 samples total). Treatment was for 12h for compound and vehicle.",

Obesity is a highly heritable complex disease that results from the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Formerly obese individuals are susceptible to metabolic disorders later in life, even after lifestyle changes are made to mitigate the obese state. This is reminiscent of the metabolic memory phenomenon originally observed for persistent complications in diabetic patients, despite subsequent glycemic control. Epigenetic modifications represent a potential mediator of this observed memory. We previously demonstrated that a high fat (HF) diet leads to changes in chromatin accessibility in the mouse liver. The regions of greatest chromatin changes in accessibility are largely strain dependent, indicating a genetic component in diet-induced chromatin alterations. We have now examined the persistence of diet-induced chromatin accessibility changes upon diet reversal in two strains of mice. We find that a substantial fraction of loci that undergo chromatin accessibility changes with HF diet remain in the remodeled state after diet reversal in C57BL/6J mice. In contrast, the vast majority of diet-induced chromatin accessibility changes in A/J mice are transient. Our data also indicate that the persistent chromatin accessibility changes observed in C57BL/6J are associated with specific transcription factors and histone posttranslational modifications. The persistent loci identified here are likely to be contributing to the overall phenotype and are attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Examination of chromatin remodeling with FAIRE-seq in livers of C57BL/6J and A/J mice on three diet regimen: 1) control diet for 16 weeks, 2) high fat diet for 16 weeks, or 3) high fat diet for 8 weeks with control diet for 8 weeks.

C5aR1, a receptor for the complement activation proinflammatory fragment, C5a, is primarily expressed on cells of the myeloid lineage, and to a lesser extent on endothelial cells and neurons in brain. Previous work demonstrated C5aR1 antagonist, PMX205, decreased amyloid pathology and suppressed cognitive deficits in Alzheimer Disease (AD) mouse models. In the Arctic AD mouse model, genetic deletion of C5aR1 prevented behavior deficits at 10 months. However, the molecular mechanisms of this protection has not been definitively demonstrated. To understand the role of microglial C5aR1 in the Arctic AD mouse model, we have taken advantage of the CX3CR1GFP and CCR2RFP reporter mice to distinguish microglia as GFP-positive and infiltrating monocytes as GFP and RFP positive, for subsequent transcriptome analysis on specifically sorted myeloid populations from wild type and AD mouse models. Immunohistochemical analysis of mice aged to 2, 5, 7 and 10 months showed no change in amyloid beta (Ab) deposition in the Arctic C5aR1 knockout (KO) mice relative to that seen in the Arctic mice. Of importance, no CCR2+ monocytes/macrophages were found near the plaques in the Arctic brain with or without C5aR1. RNA-seq analysis on microglia from these mice identified inflammation related genes as differentially expressed, with increased expression in the Arctic mice relative to wildtype and decreased expression in the Arctic/C5aR1KO relative to Arctic. In addition, phagosomal-lysosomal proteins and protein degradation pathways that were increased in the Arctic mice were further increased in the Arctic/C5aR1KO mice. These data are consistent with a microglial polarization state with restricted induction of inflammatory genes and enhancement of clearance pathways.

By generating a gefitinib resistance (PC9GR) from a human NSCLC-derived drug sensitive cell line (PC9), we studied differences of transcription dynamics between them by the aid of a computational decoupling of hidden regulatory signals from time course gene expression profiles.

Background: Estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancers (BC) are heterogeneous with regard to their clinical behavior and response to therapies. The ER is currently the best predictor of response to the anti-estrogen agent tamoxifen, yet up to 30-40% of ER+BC will relapse despite tamoxifen treatment. New prognostic biomarkers and further biological understanding of tamoxifen resistance are required. We used gene expression profiling to develop an outcome-based predictor using a training set of 255 ER+ BC samples from women treated with adjuvant tamoxifen monotherapy. We used clusters of highly correlated genes to develop our predictor to facilitate both signature stability and biological interpretation. Independent validation was performed using 362 tamoxifen-treated ER+ BC samples obtained from multiple institutions and treated with tamoxifen only in the adjuvant and metastatic settings.Results: We developed a gene classifier consisting of 181 genes belonging to 13 biological clusters. In the independent set of adjuvantly-treated samples, it was able to define two distinct prognostic groups (HR 2.01 95%CI: 1.29-3.13; p=0.002). Six of the 13 gene clusters represented pathways involved in cell cycle and proliferation.

    "text": "Expression data with mouse osteoblast cell from wild-type and retinoblastoma tumor suppressor(Rb) knock-out. Here we report the characterization of a novel role for the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) as a regulator of osteoblast adhesion. Abrogation of pRb in osteoblasts resulted in aberrant cadherin expression and loss of adherens junctions. This produced defects suggestive of a transformed phenotype such as impaired cell-to-cell adhesion, loss of contact-dependent growth arrest, and the capacity to evade anoikis. This also resulted in profound abnormalities in bone structure. Consistent with this, microarray analyses showed that pRb regulates a wide repertoire of osteoblast cell adhesion genes. In addition, pRb loss also resulted in altered expression and function of several known regulators of cellular adhesion and adherens junction assembly, such as the Rho GTPase Rac1 and the merlin tumor suppressor. Taken together, our results show that pRb controls cell adhesion by regulating the expression and adherens junction components and by regulating the function of molecules involved in adherens junction assembly and stability.Microarray results helped us to portrait the overall influence on cell adhesion via both individual genes and pathway analysis. MC3T3 cells were obtained from immortalizing primary cultured mouse osteoblast cells by using 3T3 protocol. There are 3 biological replicates for each group, 6 samples in total were analyzed.",

The identification of genes and deduced pathways from the mature human oocyte can help us better understand oogenesis, folliculogenesis, fertilization, and embryonic development. Human metaphase II oocytes were used within minutes after removal from the ovary, and its transcriptome was compared with a reference sample consisting of a mixture of total RNA from 10 different normal human tissues not including the ovary. RNA amplification was performed by using a unique protocol. Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip arrays were used for hybridizations. Compared with reference samples, there were 5,331 transcripts significantly up-regulated and 7,074 transcripts significantly down-regulated in the oocyte. Of the oocyte up-regulated probe sets, 1,430 have unknown function. A core group of 66 transcripts was identified by intersecting significantly up-regulated genes of the human oocyte with those from the mouse oocyte and from human and mouse embryonic stem cells. GeneChip array results were validated using RT-PCR in a selected set of oocyte-specific genes. Within the up-regulated probe sets, the top overrepresented categories were related to RNA and protein metabolism, followed by DNA metabolism and chromatin modification. This report provides a comprehensive expression baseline of genes expressed in in vivo matured human oocytes. Further understanding of the biological role of these genes may expand our knowledge on meiotic cell cycle, fertilization, chromatin remodeling, lineage commitment, pluripotency, tissue regeneration, and morphogenesis. . We generated a database of the human oocyte transcriptome by comparing the transcripts in the oocyte with the reference samples, which contain mRNA from several somatic tissues.Human oocytes were obtained from three patients undergoing an assisted reproductive treatment (ART) at the Unit of Reproductive Medicine of Clinica Las Condes, Santiago, Chile. It is important to emphasize that the routine in vitro fertilization protocol at Clinica Las Condes calls for fertilizing only those oocytes that will be transferred into the uterus of the patient. Therefore, there is always a surplus of oocytes. We then had the opportunity to use specific criteria to select donors as follows: (i) <35 years old, (ii) reproductively healthy with regular ovulatory cycles, (iii) male factor as the only cause of infertility, and (iv) considerable number of developing follicles that assured spared oocytes. The experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by a local independent Ethics Review Board. All donors signed informed consent. At the time this manuscript was submitted, all three donors had already conceived; two of them got pregnant during the ART cycle in which our samples were collected, and the third one got pregnant after a spontaneous cycle with artificial insemination using donated sperm. Ovarian stimulation, oocyte retrieval, and cell lysis were performed as described in Supporting Materials and Methods, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site. Three groups of 10 oocytes each were used. Reference RNA (100 mg) was prepared by mixing 10 mg of total RNA from each of 10 different normal human tissues, including skeletal muscle, kidney, lung, colon, liver, spleen, breast, brain, heart, and stomach (Ambion).

Intra-tumoral heterogeneity has been proposed to grant cancer cells a superior trajectory and survival advantage to avoid therapeutic interventions including radiation. However, direct evidence to support the hypothesis via the transcriptome dynamics of glioma during radiation therapy is limited. The current study aim to measure the functional subpopulation dynamics before and after radiation treatment that assist the radiation resistance at single cell resolution. We investigate the single cell transcriptome and biological pathways of primary glioma mouse model and post-radiation early/late time point. Specifically, we used the RCAS mouse model for gliomas, which overexpress PDGFRA as the model. Using single cell transcriptome, for the first time, we confirmed the proneural classification of PDGFRA RCAS glioma mouse model and its heterogeneity. We found that recurrent dominant subpopulations are featured with elevated proliferation rate and hypoxia. In addition, we identified a subpopulation of radiation resistant cells in at early time points with elevated stemness. Lastly, the subpopulations composition undergoes large changes at late time point when the tumor recurred. Single cell transcriptome profiling of radiation treated mouse glioma mouse model identified tumor cell subpopulations dynamics. It provides novel insights into the molecular phenotype and biological functions of radiation resistant tumor cell population. To study mechanism of glioma relapse posterior to therapeutic dose irradiation, we have used PDGF-driven murine RCAS-tva glioma model as described in Methods. These mice develop high-grade glioma at approximately week 6. The tumors mimic pathological radiological and characteristics of glioblastoma. Since tumors in the RCAS-tva mice were driven by enhanced PDGF signaling and tumor cells were potentially derived from oligodendritic progenitor cells, majority of transformed cells were are abundantly expressing PDGFRa. Once we detected the radiographic primary high-grade tumor in RCAS-tva mice, we started to irradiate mice's brain at 2 Gy every other day for five times. During week one post-radiation, we observed complete regression of primary tumors after radiation, confirmed by both MRI and histology. Thereafter, we had followed up the recurrence of tumors by MRI every week by MRI. We demonstrated that the mice had developed secondary high-grade tumors from week 4 to week 8 post-irradiation. We collected tumor samples from three time points: primary glioma (T1, primary stage), early phase of relapse post-radiation (T2, early stage), and late phase of relapse post-radiation (T3, late stage). Tumor samples were dissociated and subjected for FCAS. The stromal cell including immune cells and endothelial cells were removed and PDGFRa positive cells were isolated for subsequent analysis. To examine the transcriptome level heterogeneity of tumor cells of these three stages, we performed bulk RNA-seq and single cell RNA-seq experiments for the FCAS sorted tumor cells using Fluidgm C1 system.",

Specific deletion of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (Socs3) in keratinocytes can cause severe skin inflammation with infiltration of immune cells, however the molecular mechanisms and key regulatory pathways involved remains poorly understood. To investigate the role of Socs3 in keratinocytes, we generated and analyzed global RNA-Seq profiles in Socs3 conditional knockout (cKO) mice at two different stages (2- and 10- weeks). Over 400 shared genes were found to be significantly regulated at both time points. Two week samples were marked by initial skin barrier dysfunction established by the downregulation of keratin associated genes and upregulation of genes regulating lipid metabolism. Subsequent increase in expression level of multiple chemokines and cytokines at 10 week were observed representing response to skin inflammation caused by the disruption of skin barrier function. A group of activator protein-1 related genes were to found to be highly elevated in Socs3 cKO mice at both time points. This observation was duly validated using qRT-PCR in Socs3 depleted human keratinocyte-derived HaCaT cells. Overall this study reveals an important regulatory dynamics of Socs3 in skin barrier dysfunction.

Purpose: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone malignancy. OS consists of several subtypes including fibroblastic, osteoblastic and chondroblastic OS. We have developed genetically engineered mouse models of human OS that recapitulate two distinct subtypes, fibroblastic (Osx-CreLox p53-/- Rb-/-) and osteoblastic (Osx-Cre shRNA p53-/-) OS. The goal of this study was to identify transcriptional differences that distinguish the two subtypes.Methods: mRNA profiles of cell lines derived from tumours from Osx-Cre p53fl/fl Rbfl/fl (fibroblastic OS) and Osx-Cre shRNA TRE-p53.1224 pRbfl/fl (osteoblastic OS) mouse models were generated by RNA sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript level with TopHat followed by Cufflinks.Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 30 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build mm9) and identified 12,436 transcripts in the tumours of Osx-Cre p53fl/fl Rbfl/fl and 12,074 Osx-Cre shRNA TRE-p53.1224 pRbfl/fl with the TopHat workflow.

To identify the epigenetic changes involved in GD, we performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation and enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone marks in sorted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We found 365 and 3322 differentially methylated CpG sites in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively. Among the hypermethylated CpG sites, we specifically found enrichment of genes involved in T cell signaling (CD247, LCK, ZAP70, CD3D, CD3E, CD3G, CTLA4 and CD8A) and decreased expression of CD3 gene family members. The hypermethylation was accompanied with the active chromatin histone modifications as we found decreased signals of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac marks at several T cell signaling genes in ChIP-seq analysis.

Recent evidence suggests that lncRNAs play an integral regulatory role in numerous functions, including determination of cellular identity. We determined global expression (RNA-seq) and genome wide profiles (ChIP-seq) of histone post-translational modifications and p53 binding in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) undergoing differentiation to define a high-confidence set of 40 lncRNAs, which are p53 transcriptional targets. We focused on lncRNAs, highly expressed in pluripotent hESCs and repressed by p53 during differentiation, to identify lncPRESS1 as a p53-regulated transcript that maintains hESC pluripotency in concert with core pluripotency factors. RNA-seq of hESCs depleted of lncPRESS1 revealed that lncPRESS1 controls a gene network that promotes pluripotency. Further, we found that lncPRESS1 physically interacts with SIRT6 to prevent SIRT6 chromatin localization and maintain high levels of histone H3K56 and H3K9 acetylation at promoters of pluripotency genes. In summary, we describe a novel pluripotency-specific lncRNA that safeguards the hESC state by disrupting SIRT6 activity.

Modulating the host response is a promising approach to treating influenza, a virus whose pathogenesis is determined in part by the host response it elicits. Though the pathogenicity of emerging H7N9 influenza virus has been reported in several animal models, these studies have not included a detailed characterization of the host response following infection. To this end, we characterized the transcriptomic response of BALB/c mice infected with H7N9 (A/Anhui/1/2013) virus and compared it to the responses induced by H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004), H7N7 (A/Netherlands/219/2003) or H1N1 (A/Mexico/4482/2009) viruses. We found that responses to the H7 subtype viruses were intermediate to those elicited by H5N1 and H1N1 early in infection, but that they evolved to resemble the H5N1 response as infection progressed. H5N1, H7N7 and H7N9 viruses were pathogenic in mice, and this pathogenicity correlated with increased cytokine response, decreased lipid metabolism and decreased coagulation signaling. This three-pronged signature has previously been observed in mice infected with pathogenic H1N1 strains such as the 1918 virus, indicating that it may be predictive of pathogenicity across multiple influenza strains. Groups of 6- to 8-week-old BALB/c mice were infected with either A/Anhui/01/2013 (H7N9), A/Netherlands/219/2003 (H7N7), A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1), or pandemic H1N1 human virus, A/Mexico/4482/2007 (H1N1).

IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 3 (IQGAP3) has been implicated in diverse cellular processes including neuronal morphogenesis, cell proliferation and motility as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition. However, its roles in DNA damage and repair remain to be clarified. Here, we demonstrate that IQGAP3 is frequently overproduced and predicts poor prognosis in lung cancer patients. Functionally, we provide evidence that depletion of IQGAP3 impairs tumorigenesis and overcomes radioresistance in lung cancer in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we uncover that IQGAP3 interacts with and controls the stability of Rad17 to activate the ATM/Chk2 signaling by recruiting Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex in response to DNA damage. Moreover, Rad17 is identified as the major downstream effector that mediates the functions of IQGAP3 in lung cancer. Clinically, IQGAP3 overexpression positively correlates with Rad17 protein levels in human lung cancer tissues. Collectively, these data support key roles for IQGAP3 in promoting tumorigenesis and radioresistance in lung cancer by stabilizing the Rad17 protein and suggest targeting IQGAP3 is a promising therapeutic strategy for lung cancer radiotherapy.

Identification of cell surface markers specific to human pancreatic b-cells would allow in vivo analysis and imaging.

NTPDase3 is expressed dynamically during postnatal human pancreas development, appearing first in acinar cells at birth, but several months later its expression declines in acinar cells while concurrently emerges in islet b-cells.

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a 152 Kb double stranded DNA alpha-herpesvirus, which establishes long life latent infection in sensory neurons. Most of our knowledge regarding HSV-1 latency comes from in vivo studies using small animal models, mainly rodents and rabbits, which are not naturally infected by HSV-1. Furthermore, these animal models do not fully recapitulate the species specific effects of human HSV-1 infection. Human cellular models utilize trigeminal ganglia removed from cadavers or, alternatively, neuron-like cells derived from cancerous cell lines that do not fully reflect effects on normal human neurons. This limitation poses the need to develop an in vitromodel to investigate molecular details of the mechanisms underlying quiescence and reactivation in human neurons. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) celltechnologies offer an unprecedented opportunity to generate unlimited supplies of neurons and the facility to manipulate such cells in vitro. In this study, we developed an in vitro HSV-1 infection model in human iPS-derived neurons, which displays the main hallmarks of latency defined in animal models and in humans. Our results show for the first time that: i) persistent infection cannot be established in neural progenitor cells (NPCs); ii) the ability of HSV-1 to establish persistent infection is extended to glutamatergic neurons, and not limited to sensory neurons; iii) in neuronal cultures persistently infected with HSV-1, viral genome is localized at the nuclear periphery; iv) HSV-1 acute infection reduces RNA editing at the GluRB site. These results highlight the importance of iPS-based platforms to elucidate unknown aspects of HSV-1 quiescence in human neurons. NPCs were 70-80% confluence.",

Chronic inflammation has been proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of diet-induced obesity. However, scarce therapeutic options are available to treat obesity and the associated immunometabolic complications. Glucocorticoids are routinely employed for the management of inflammatory diseases, but their pleiotropic nature leads to detrimental metabolic side effects. We developed a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-Dexamethasone co-agonist in which GLP-1 selectively delivers Dexamethasone to GLP-1 receptor-expressing cells. GLP-1-Dexamethasone lowers body weight up to 25% in obese mice by targeting the hypothalamic control of feeding and by increasing energy expenditure. This strategy reverses hypothalamic and systemic inflammation while improving glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. The selective preference for GLP-1 receptors bypasses deleterious effects of Dexamethasone on glucose handling, bone integrity, and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. Thus, GLP-1-directed glucocorticoid pharmacology represents an efficacious therapy option for diet-induced immunometabolic derangements and the resulting obesity. To elucidate the in vivo signaling properties of GLP-1/Dexa, we performed unbiased transcriptional profiling (mRNA-seq) of hypothalami from DIO mice treated for 5 days with vehicle, GLP-1/Dexa, Dexamethasone (Dexa) or with GLP-1 at the equimolar doses of 100 nmol/kg.

Oxidative stress and mitochondrial function have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD but the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the degeneration of specific neuronal groups remains unclear. DJ-1 mutations are one cause of recessive parkinsonism, but this gene is also involved in cancer by promoting Ras signaling and suppressing PTEN-induced apoptosis. The specific function of DJ-1 is unclear, although it is responsive to oxidative stress and may play a role in the maintenance of mitochondria. Here we show that DJ-1 associates with specific RNA targets in cells and in the brain including mitochondrial genes, genes involved in glutathione metabolism and members of the PTEN/PI3K cascade. Pathogenic recessive mutants are deficient in this activity. We show that DJ-1 is sufficient for RNA binding at nanomolar concentrations in vitro and that there is some RNA sequence specificity to the association. Oxidative stress causes DJ-1 to dissociate from RNA. Using in vitro and in vivo models of mild oxidative stress, we show that DJ-1 normally suppresses translation in normal circumstances but allows translation after oxidative stress. We tested the hypothesis that these specific RNA targets are responsible for sensitivity to stress by exposing knockout flies to glutathione synthesis inhibitors and saw the predicted increased sensitivity in vivo. These data implicate a single mechanism for the pleiotropic effects of DJ-1 in different model systems, namely that the protein binds and regulates specific groups of RNA targets in an oxidationdependent manner. Furthermore, these results suggest how a small protein might both be an upstream regulator of processes important in parkinsonism and be a modifier of cancer-related processes.Keywords: Immunoprecipitated RNA comparisons. 6-8 biological replicates of RNA immunoprecipitated with DJ-1 protein was compared to RNA isolated with a nonspecific IgG control antibody in human cells, or to nonspecific RNA isolated with the DJ-1 antibody from KO mouse brains.",

Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), defined by lacking the expression of oestrogen receptor-alpha (ERa), progesterone receptor, and HER2, is considered to be one of the most aggressive subtypes of all breast cancers. To elucidate the genomic and molecular aberrations in TNBC, we performed whole exon sequencing (WES) analysis on 36 TNBC, and identified 117 genes that significantly mutated (q < 0.05) in TNBC including MUC4, MUC6, TP53, and PIK3CA. Interestingly, genes associated with chromatin regulators including the subunits of SWI/SNF complex were frequently mutated in 44.7% of the cases. Furthermore, from the aspect of the possible association of epigenetic dysregulation and TNBC carcinogenesis, we focused on epigenome and genetic alterations of SALL3, an intrinsic inhibitor of DNMT3A, and identified the role of its dysfunction on cancer cell growth. Our study suggests that epigenetic aberrations caused by somatic alterations including DNA methylation might be a potential pathogenesis of TNBC in a certain number of cases.

Here we show that endothelial KLF2 and KLF4 control a large segment of the endothelial transcriptome thereby affecting virtually all key endothelial functions. Inducible endothelial-specific deletion of Klf2 and/or Klf4 reveals that a single allele of either gene is sufficient for survival, but absence of both (EC-DKO) results in acute death from myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke. EC-DKO animals exhibit profound compromise in vascular integrity and profound dysregulation of the coagulation system.

Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) has been explored as a vaccine vector for use against infectious diseases and cancer. MVA is an immunogenic, attenuated poxvirus capable of eliciting robust cellular and humoral responses in pre-clinical animal models and in patients. However, upon infection with MVA, cells undergo rapid apoptosis leading to faster clearance of recombinant antigens. The fragmentation of the anti-apoptotic gene B13R in MVA could contribute to this effect. Here, we replaced the fragmented B13R with a functional version and observed that MVA-B13R infected HeLa cells and muscle cell lines delayed caspase 3 activation compared to MVA indicating slower progression of apoptosis. For immunogenicity studies, mice were intramuscularly immunized with recombinant MVA or MVA-B13R expressing SIV Gag, Pol and HIV Env (SHIV). We observed higher Env-specific humoral responses from MVA-B13R SHIV compared to MVA SHIV mice. To determine differences in the innate immune response that may have contributed to the augmented humoral response, we performed RNA-Seq analysis on draining lymph node cells after immunization. Gene set enrichment analysis from day 1 after immunization showed that MVA-B13R SHIV immunizations were associated with a negative enrichment for type I and II interferon responses compared to MVA SHIV mice indicating MVA-B13R SHIV induces a delayed anti-viral interferon response that may lead to the enhanced humoral response observed. Taken together, these results demonstrate that restoring B13R functionality in MVA significantly delays MVA-induced apoptosis, augments Env-specific antibody responses, and is associated with reduced interferon-alpha and interferon-gamma responses induced after vaccination. Female BALB/c mice were intramuscularly immunized at 10^7 pfu/dose with MVA expressing SHIV antigens or MVA-B13R expressing SHIV.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) propagates as a cellular hierarchy which is maintained by a rare subpopulation of self-renewing leukemia-initiating cells (LICs). These LICs phenotypically resemble HSCs and early myeloid progenitors, and they are functionally defined by their ability to reconstitute AML in xenografted mice.Common transcriptional regulators are believed to drive self-renewal of LICs and normal stem cells. Examples include the histone methyltransferase, MLL and its main targets, the transcription factors HOXA9 and MEIS1; the polycomb group protein, BMI-1; and the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway4-9. In AML patients, LICs have been shown to share broad gene expression signatures with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and, in some cases, with embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Moreover, increased expression of these stem cell signatures has been linked to tumor aggressiveness.Elucidating the molecular determinants of stem cell properties in LICs has the potential to improve AML therapy and clarify the relationship between cancer and stem cell biology in general. Here we show that the propagation of LICs in AML depends on Zfx, a transcription factor required for the self-renewal of ESCs and HSCs. Using mouse models, we found that Zfx is required for AML propagation and LIC maintenance. We defined a Zfx-driven gene expression program in murine LICs that correlates with existing stem cell-related gene expression signatures in AML patients. Using a novel, stroma-based RNAi screening strategy, we identified functionally important Zfx target genes. Two of these genes - FAM92A1 and DOCK7 - are required for human AML cell propagation; moreover, their expression levels strongly correlate with AML patient survival across the full spectrum of AML subtypes. Together, our results characterize a novel gene expression program that orchestrates critical stem cell properties of LICs, and drives aggressiveness of AML. Independent primary MLL-AF9 AML cell lines were created carrying the tamoxifen inducible Cre-ER transgene and either the Zfx wild-type (wt/y) (lines 10977, 10980) or the Zfx conditional (Zfx fl/y) allele (lines 10949, 10950, 10986).

With current therapy protocols up to 90 % of patients can be cured, but there is still a need to improve therapy for patients with aggressive WT and to reduce treatment intensity where possible. Prior data suggested deregulation of the retinoic acid (RA) pathway in high-risk WT. This could be validated in a large independent tumor set. Reduced RA pathway activity and MYCN overexpression were found in high risk tumors as opposed to tumors with low/intermediate risk, suggesting a beneficial impact of RA on advanced WT. To investigate the possible mode of action of retinoids as a novel therapeutic agent we treated primary tumor cell cultures with all-trans-RA (ATRA), 9cis-RA, fenretinide and combinations of retinoids and a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. Genes deregulated in high risk tumors showed opposite changes upon treatment suggesting a positive effect of retinoids. 6/7 primary cultures tested reduced proliferation, irrespective of prior RA signaling levels. The only variant culture was derived from mesoblastic nephroma, a distinct childhood kidney neoplasm. Retinoid / HDAC inhibitor combinations provided no synergistic effect. ATRA and 9cis-RA induced morphological changes suggestive of differentiation, while fenretinide induced apoptosis in several cultures tested. Microarray analysis of ATRA treated WT cells revealed differential expression of many genes involved in extracellular matrix formation and osteogenic, neuronal or muscle differentiation. Although some of the effects appear to be reversible, these findings provide further evidence of a potential utility of retinoids in Wilms tumor treatment. total samples analysed are 2.",

Biologically and clinically meaningful tumor classification schemes have long been sought. Some malignant epithelial neoplasms, such as those in the thyroid and endometrium, exhibit more than one pattern of differentiation, each associated with distinctive clinical features and treatments. In other tissues, all carcinomas, regardless of morphological type, are treated as though they represent a single disease. To better understand the biological and clinical features seen in the four major histological types of ovarian carcinoma (OvCa), we analyzed gene expression in 113 ovarian epithelial tumors using oligonucleotide microarrays. Global views of the variation in gene expression were obtained using PCA. These analyses show that mucinous and clear cell OvCas can be readily distinguished from serous OvCas based on their gene expression profiles, regardless of tumor stage and grade. In contrast, endometrioid adenocarcinomas show significant overlap with other histological types. Although high-stage/grade tumors are generally separable from low-stage/grade tumors, clear cell OvCa has a molecular signature that distinguishes it from other poor-prognosis OvCas. Indeed, 73 genes, expressed 2- to 29-fold higher in clear cell OvCas compared with each of the other OvCa types, were identified. Collectively, the data indicate that gene expression patterns in ovarian adenocarcinomas reflect both morphological features and biological behavior.

    "text": "Dynamic Quantitative Analytic Response of Human Natural Killer Cells at Single-Cell Resolution in B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. Natural Killer (NK) cells are phenotypically and functionally diverse lymphocytes that recognize and kill cancer cells. The susceptibility of target cancer cells to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity depends on the strength and balance of regulatory (activating/inhibitory) ligands expressed on target cell surface. We performed gene expression arrays to determine patterns of NK cell ligands associated with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (b-NHL). Microarray analyses revealed differential upregulation of a multitude of NK-activating and costimulatory ligands across varied lymphoma cell lines and b-NHL cells including ULBP1, CD72, CD48 and SLAMF6. To correlate genetic signatures with functional anti-lymphoma activity, we developed a dynamic and quantitative cytotoxicity assay in an integrated microfluidic droplet array. This assay facilitated the examination of transient interactions between NK cells and target lymphoma cells and also the functional heterogeneity in NK cell effector outcomes at single-cell level. Individual NK cells and target lymphoma cells were co-encapsulated in picoliter-volume droplets and imaged over time to quantify heterotypic cell-cell interaction. We identified significant variability in NK-lymphoma cell contact duration, frequency and subsequent cytolysis. The death of lymphoma cells undergoing single contact with NK cells occurred faster than cells that made multiple short contacts. NK cells also killed target cells in droplets via contact-independent mechanisms that partially relied on calcium-dependent processes and perforin secretion, but not on cytokines (IFN-g or TNF-a). We extended this technique to characterize cytolysis of primary cells from b-NHL patients. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells from two patients showed similar contact durations with NK cells; primary Burkitt lymphoma cells made longer contacts and were lysed at later times. We further tested the cytotoxic efficacy of NK-92, a continuously growing NK cell line being investigated as an anti-tumor therapy, using our droplet-based bioassay. NK-92 cells were found to be more efficient in killing b-NHL cells compared with primary/fresh NK cells, requiring shorter contacts for faster killing activity. Taken together, our combined genetic and microfluidic analysis demonstrate significant heterogeneity in the dynamic interaction and associated cytotoxicity between NK cellular therapy and b-NHL cells. For genome-wide expression profiling of SUDHL4, SUHDL10, EL-2 (also called DLBCL.1), EL-5 (also called DLBCL.2), and Raji cells were grown under normal conditions and Human HT-12 BeadArray chips (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were used.

These experiments were performed in biological triplicates. All replicate samples were run individually. Total RNA of 500ng per sample was amplified using AmbionTotalPrep, and 1.5ug of the product was loaded onto the chips. Following hybridization at 55C, the chips were washed and then scanned using the Illumina iScan System. The data was checked with GenomeStudio (Illumina) for quality control.

Epigenetic modifying enzymes are commonly mutated in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), suggesting that epigenetic regulation is an important factor in DLBCL pathogenesis and a potential target for therapy. We developed resistant cell lines to histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), one such epigenetic therapy, in order to define mechanisms of response and resistance. Strikingly, using gene expression and metabolic profiling, we found that development of HDACi resistance was associated with differentiation toward a plasmablast-like phenotype. Differentiation correlated with decreased B cell receptor signaling, increased ER stress and activation of the unfolded protein response, and increased sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors. Importantly, we found evidence of differentiation in lymphoma biopsies from patients treated with HDACi. Together, these data show, for the first time, that HDACi are differentiating agents in lymphoma and may be used to prime DLBCL for targeted therapy including proteasome inhibitors.

    "text": "Does Type of Dietary Fat Matter? Prostate Cancer Xenograft Progression in a SCID Mouse Model with Varying Dietary Fat Sources. PURPOSE: Previous mouse studies using corn oil (o-6) as the dietary fat source suggest that decreasing dietary fat content can slow prostate cancer (PCa) growth. However, other studies, in which the diet was composed around saturated fat, showed no difference in outcomes between high-fat and low-fat diets. The relative effects of other fats, such as fish oil and olive oil, also remain unexplored. To our knowledge, no trial has yet compared the effect of various fats on prostate cancer progression. Therefore, we sought to systematically study the effect of fish oil, olive oil, corn oil, and saturated fat on prostate cancer progression. METHODS: A total of 96 male SCID mice were injected with LAPC-4 human PCa cells. Two weeks following injection, mice were singly-housed and randomized to either a fish oil, olive oil, corn oil, or saturated fat based diet. Animals were euthanized when tumors reached 1,000 mm3. Serum was collected at sacrifice and assayed for PSA, insulin, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and PGE-2 levels. Tumors were also assayed for PGE-2, and COX-2 levels, and gene array analysis was performed. RESULTS: Mice weights and tumor volumes were equivalent across groups at randomization. Overall, fish-oil consumption was associated with improved survival, relative to all other dietary groups (Log-rank, all p<0.05). We did not detect any significant difference in serum PSA, insulin, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and PGE-2 levels. Glucose at the time of sacrifice was statistically different between groups, with the fish-oil fed mice having the highest levels of serum glucose (Kruskal-Wallis, p=0.03).CONCLUSIONS: In this prostate cancer xenograft model, we found that consuming a diet in which fish-oil was the only fat source slowed tumor growth in improved survival, compared to mice consuming diets composed of olive oil, corn oil, or saturated fat sources. These results suggest that type of dietary fat consumed may be as important as amount of dietary fat consumed in the setting of prostate cancer. DESIGN: A total of 96 male SCID mice were injected with LAPC-4 human prostate cancer cells. After 2 weeks of tumor growth, the mice were randomized to one of four diets: corn oil, fish oil, olive oil, and saturated fat source diets. Animals were euthanized when tumor volumes exceeded 1000 mm^3. Sera and tissues from the median 6 surviving animals from each of the four dietary groups were analyzed.",

The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is a highly successful intracellular pathogen, owing in part to its ability to subvert the host immune system. In particular, parasite infection suppresses STAT1 signaling in a variety of cell types, including IFN-g activated macrophages, via a block within the nucleus. A high-throughput screen to identify genes able to overcome parasite-mediated suppression of STAT1 activity identified 9 transcription factors as enhancers of STAT1 signaling in T. gondii infected cells, including the orphan nuclear hormone receptor TLX. Expression profiling revealed that TLX is a transcriptional regulator that drives the steady-state expression of STAT1-independent genes involved brain function and development, while enhancing the output of a subset of IFN-g-dependent target genes. Infection of TLX deficient mice with Toxoplasma results in impaired production of interleukin-12 by dendritic cells and increased parasite burden in the brain during chronic infection. These results demonstrate a previously unrecognized function for this orphan nuclear hormone receptor in regulating STAT1 signaling and host defense, and reveal that STAT1 activity can be modulated in a context-specific manner by such 'modifiers'. The human astroglioma cell line, U251, was transiently transfected with siRNA targeting human TLX. 72 hours after transfection with siRNA to TLX or a negative control siRNA, cells were stimulated for 8 hours with 10ng/ml of recombinant IFN-gamma.

Understanding congenital liver disease requires elucidation of the signaling pathways and transcriptional events in the developing liver. Comprehensive assessment of gene expression between 10.5 and 16.5 dpc in the developing mouse liver and comparison with adult liver and non-hepatic embryonic tissue was validated with real-time PCR and in situ hybridization. The broad nature of the analysis provides insights into patterns of genetic control of hepatogenesis. Pathways implicated in human disease are highly regulated at the transcriptional level. Rather than activating or inhibiting a pathway or biological process by altering the expression of a single signaling molecule, transcriptional changes in large numbers of genes in a pathway or process are regulated in a coordinated manner. For example, both TGF-beta and Notch signaling is inhibited during hepatogenesis not just by decreasing transcription of multiple pathway members, but also with a complementary increase in the transcription of a pathway inhibitor. Similarly, genes related to specific biological processes exhibit strong temporal synchronization in which multiple members of the pathway have similar transcriptional regulation over time. Global coordination of signaling or functional families at the transcriptional level may be a mechanism to produce robustness of the desired outcomes. In addition, this comprehensive analysis provides a database for the further study of transcriptional events during liver development by identifying liver-specific, highly regulated genes.

    "text": "Expression analysis of colonic neurons stimulated with AhR agonist (3-methylcholanthrene). Neural control of visceral organ function is essential for homeostasis and health. Intestinal peristalsis is critical for digestive physiology and host defence and is often dysregulated in gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Luminal factors, such as diet and microbiota regulate neurogenic programs of gut motility, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that the transcription factor Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) functions as a biosensor in intestinal neural circuits linking their functional output to the microbial environment of the gut lumen. Using nuclear RNA sequencing of mouse enteric neurons representing distinct intestinal segments and microbiota states, we demonstrate that the intrinsic neural networks of the colon exhibit unique transcriptional profiles controlled by the combined effects of host genetic programmes and microbial colonisation. Microbiota-induced expression of AhR in neurons of the distal gastrointestinal tract enables them to respond to the luminal environment and induce expression of neuron-specific effector mechanisms. Neuron-specific deletion of Ahr or constitutive overexpression of its negative feedback regulator CYP1A1, results in reduced peristaltic activity of the colon, similar to that observed in microbiota-depleted mice. Finally, expression of Ahr in enteric neurons of antibiotic-treated mice partially restores intestinal motility. Taken together, our experiments identify AhR signalling in enteric neurons as a regulatory node that integrates the luminal environment with the physiological output of intestinal neural circuits towards gut homeostasis and health.The enteric nervous system (ENS) encompasses the intrinsic neural networks of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which regulate most aspects of intestinal physiology, including peristalsis. In addition to host-specific genetic programmes, microbiota and diet have emerged as critical regulators of gut tissue physiology and changes in the microbial composition of the lumen often accompany GI disorders. We found that gut environmental sensor Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is induced in colonic neurons in response to microbiota colonisation and regulates intestinal peristalsis in an AhR ligand-dependent manner. In this experiment, we used RNA sequencing to identify genes regulated in mouse colonic neurons by AhR activation. We developed an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based strategy for isolation and RNA sequencing of enteric neuron nuclei (nRNAseq) representing different intestinal segments and microbiota states. For isolation of neuronal nuclei from the myenteric plexus, mice were injected intravenously with AAV9-CaMKII-EGFPKASH. 5 weeks after intravenous injection of AAV, the longitudinal smooth muscle layer and associated myenteric plexus were peeled off the wall of the smal intestine (SI) and colon and subjected to Dounce homogenization. After filtering the homogenate to remove large debris, samples were centrifuged at 1000 x G for 10 min at 4degC to obtain a pellet containing muscularis externa nuclei. For flow cytometric analysis, doublet discrimination gating was applied to exclude aggregated nuclei, and intact nuclei were determined by subsequent gating on the area and height of DAPI intensity.

This exposure is asymptomatic in most individuals but can be associated with a spectrum of diseases ranging from asthma and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis to aspergilloma and invasive aspergillosis.

We also assessed the prognostic value of the identified candidate genes and splice variants. Results: A 5-splice signature (HSPA8, RPL10, RPL4, DIDO1 and EVL) was able to distinguish IBC from non-IBC tumors (p<10-7). This splice signature was associated with poor metastasis-free survival (MFS) in hormone receptor-negative non-IBC (p=0.02), whereas it had no prognostic value in IBC patients. A PAM analysis of deregulated genes in IBC compared to non-IBC identified a 10-gene signature highly predictive of IBC phenotype and conferring a poor prognosis in non-IBC.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) syndrome is a very rare human genetic disease and until now, it's proper treatment has not been suggested. In our recent study, it has been reported that the loss of NF2 activates MAPK signaling through reduction of RKIP in a mesothelioma model. Here, we show that loss of NF2 induces reduction of the TGF-b receptor 2 (TbR2) expression and an overwhelming expression of TGF-b receptor 1 is activated by physical stimuli such as pressure or heavy materials. Activated TR1 induced the phosphorylation and degradation of RKIP. RKIP reduction consequently results in MAPK activation as well as Snail-mediated p53 suppression and occurrence of EMT in NF2-deficient cells by physical stimuli. Thus, TbR1 kinase inhibitors restore cell differentiation and induce growth suppression in NF2 deficient Schwannoma cell line and MEF. Moreover, TEW7197, a specific TbR1 kinase inhibitor, reduces tumor formation in the NF2-model mouse (Postn-Cre;NF2f/f). Gene expression profiling reveals that TEW7197-treatment induces the expression of lipid metabolism-related gene set such as NF2-restored cells in HEI-193 (NF2-deficient Schwannoma). Our results indicate that reduction or deletion of TbR2 or NF2 induces the TbR1-mediated oncogenic pathway, and therefore inhibition of the unbalanced TGF-b signaling is a putative strategy for NF2-related cancers (NF2 syndrome and mesothelioma) and TbR2 mutated advanced cancers.To know the global effect of TEW7197, we performed the microarray with HEI-193.

We find that haGSCs and fibroblasts have a similar gene-expression profile, but that haGSCs and hESCs do not. The pluripotency of Conrad and colleagues' haGSCs is therefore called into question. RNA samples from human testicular fibroblast cells (hTFCs) were obtained and applied to global gene expression analysis using gene arrays. .",

Although an important association between lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis in breast cancer was observed decades ago, an active role for the lymphatic system in metastatic dissemination has only recently been examined. We demonstrate that the Six1 homeoprotein promotes peri- and intra-tumoral lymphangiogenesis, lymphatic invasion, and distant metastasis of breast cancer cells. We identify the pro-lymphangiogenic factor, VEGF-C, as required for this process, and demonstrate transcriptional induction as the mechanism of regulation of VEGF-C expression by Six1. Using a different, but complementary animal model, we show that while required, VEGF-C is not sufficient for the pro-metastatic effects of Six1. Verifying the clinical significance of this pro-metastatic Six1-VEGF-C axis, we demonstrate co-expression of Six1 and VEGF-C in human breast cancer. Two Control and two Six1 expressing MCF7 clones were orthotopically injected into NOD/Scid mice forming a total of 3 Control and 3 Six1 tumors that were allowed to grow to 2 cm^3 . The tumors were dissected and total RNA was isolated from each tumor and hybridized to Affymetrix arrays.",

TAF3 is a core promoter complex protein that contains a PHD finger that interacts with H3K4me3.

Currently, there is no drug treatment to prevent or slow the development of DN. Rosiglitazone (Rosi) is a potent insulin sensitizer and may also slow the development of DN by a mechanism independent of its effect on hyperglycemia. A two by two design was used to test the effect of Rosi treatment on the development of DN. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic DBA/2J mice were treated with Rosi. DN and oxidative stress were quantified, and gene expression was profiled using the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 microarray platform. An informatics approach identified key regulatory elements activated by Rosi. Diabetic DBA/2J mice developed severe hyperglycemia, DN and elevated oxidative stress. Rosi treatment did not affect hyperglycemia but did reduce oxidative stress and prevented development of thermal hypoalgesia. Two novel transcription factor binding modules were identified that may control genes correlated to changes in DN following Rosi treatment: SP1F_ZBPF and EGRF_EGRF. Rosi treatment reduced oxidative stress and DN independent of its insulin sensitizing effects. Gene expression profiling identified two novel targets activated by Rosi treatment.

Status epilepticus (SE) is a life-threatening condition that can give rise to a number of neurological disorders, including learning deficits, depression, and epilepsy. Many of the effects of SE appear to be mediated by alterations in gene expression. To gain deeper insight into how SE affects the transcriptome, we employed the pilocarpine SE model in mice and Illumina-based high-throughput sequencing to characterize alterations in gene expression from the induction of SE, to the development of spontaneous seizure activity. While some genes were upregulated over the entire course of the pathological progression, each of the three sequenced time points (12-hour, 10-days and 6-weeks post-SE) had a largely unique transcriptional profile. Hence, genes that regulate synaptic physiology and transcription were most prominently altered at 12-hours post-SE; at 10-days post-SE, marked changes in metabolic and homeostatic gene expression were detected; at 6-weeks, substantial changes in the expression of cell excitability and morphogenesis genes were detected. At the level of cell signaling, KEGG analysis revealed dynamic changes within the MAPK pathways, as well as in CREB-associated gene expression. Notably, the inducible expression of several noncoding transcripts was also detected. These findings offer potential new insights into the cellular events that shape SE-evoked pathology. . cDNA from two animals was pooled into two independent biological replicates for each timepoint (ie. two sets of two animals per experimental group: control, 12 hours, 10 days, 6 weeks).

Background: While BMPR2 mutation strongly predisposes to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), only 20% of mutation carriers develop clinical disease. This finding suggests that modifier genes contribute to FPAH clinical expression. Since modifiers are likely to be common alleles, this problem is not tractable by traditional genetic approaches. Further, examination of gene expression is complicated by confounding effects attributable to drugs and the disease process itself. Methods: To resolve these problems, B-cells were isolated, EBV-immortalized, and cultured from familial PAH patients with BMPR2 mutations, mutation positive but disease-free family members, and family members without mutation. This allows examination of differences in gene expression without drug or disease-related effects. These differences were assayed by Affymetrix array, with follow-up by quantitative RT-PCR and additional statistical analyses. Results: By gene array, we found consistent alterations in multiple pathways with known relationship to PAH, including actin organization, immune function, calcium balance, growth, and apoptosis. Selected genes were verified by quantitative RT-PCR using a larger sample set. Analysis of overrepresented gene ontology groups suggests that it is pathway-specific, not gene-specific changes that carry increased risk of disease. Conclusions: B-cell lines are a valuable and accessible tool for assaying alterations in gene expression free from drug and disease effects. Predisposition to disease within BMPR2 mutation carriers was linked to several pathways, including proliferation, GTP signaling, and stress response.Keywords: Search for modifier genes.

We developed miniaturized 3D model systems that facilitate investigation of morphogenesis and invasion of normal and PrCa cell lines in lrECM. Primary and non-transformed cell lines formed round structures with strong cell-cell contacts and epithelial polarization, lumen and a complete basal lamina (BL). In contrast, most PrCa cell lines formed either defective, \"mass\" spheroids with incomplete BL, or invasive \"stellate\" structures. The bioinformatic analyses of genome-wide mRNA expression data revealed massive alteration of key functional and signaling pathways in 3D cultures, with lipid and steroid metabolism, epigenetic reprogramming, and differentiation-related transcription factors induced across all cell lines by lrECM. In invasive cells, AKT, PI3Kinase, mTOR, and hedgehog signaling pathways were most highly activated, validated by small molecule inhibitors compounds specifically targeting key regulatory molecules. Compounds against AKT and PI3kinase pathways were significantly more effective in invasive cells, compared to mass or round/normal phenotype spheroids, and monolayer culture. A severe morphologic conversion was observed in PC-3 and PC-3M cells, transforming initially round, normal-appearing epithelial spheroids into rapidly invading cell masses. Markers for EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) were highly expressed already in early stage, round spheroids prior to invasive conversion, and were not further increased in invasive cells. This indicates that PrCa cells can display extraordinary plasticity. EMT may be involved in providing a metastable genotype that allows morphological transformation, but is not be required for invasive processes themselves. Total RNA was obtained from non-transformed prostate epithelial cells and prostate cancer cells cultured in monolayer and three-dimensional laminin-rich extracellular matrix (growth factor-reduced Matrigel).",

    "text": "Gene expression microarray profiling in mice hearts with pathological and physiological cardiac hypertrophy. Compelling evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of heart failure, including defects in the substrate oxidation, and the electron transport chain (ETC) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). However, whether such changes occur early in the development of heart failure, and are potentially involved in the pathologic events that lead to cardiac dysfunction is unknown. To address this question, we conducted transcriptomic/metabolomics profiling in hearts of mice with two progressive stages of pressure overload-induced cardiac hypetrophy: i) cardiac hypertrophy with preserved ventricular function achieved via transverse aortic constriction for 4 weeks (TAC) and ii) decompensated cardiac hypertrophy or heart failure (HF) caused by combining 4 wk TAC with a small apical myocardial infarction. Transcriptomic analyses revealed, as shown previously, downregulated expression of genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in both TAC and HF hearts compared to sham-operated control hearts. Surprisingly, however, there were very few changes in expression of genes involved in other mitochondrial energy transduction pathways, ETC, or OXPHOS. Metabolomic analyses demonstrated significant alterations in pathway metabolite levels in HF (but not in TAC), including elevations in acylcarnitines, a subset of amino acids, and the lactate/pyruvate ratio. In contrast, the majority of organic acids were lower than controls. This metabolite profile suggests \"bottlenecks\" in the carbon substrate input to the TCA cycle. This transcriptomic/metabolomic profile was markedly different from that of mice PGC-1a/b deficiency in which a global downregulation of genes involved in mitochondrial ETC and OXPHOS was noted. In addition, the transcriptomic/metabolomic signatures of HF differed markedly from that of the exercise-trained mouse heart. We conclude that in contrast to current dogma, alterations in mitochondrial metabolism that occur early in the development of heart failure reflect largely post-transcriptional mechanisms resulting in impedance to substrate flux into the TCA cycle, reflected by alterations in the metabolome. Microarray gene expression profiling was performed with bi-ventricle RNA isolated from (1) 3 month-old female C57Bl6/J mice with transverse aortic constriction (CH), vs sham-operated control (Sham-CH), (2) 3 month-old female C57Bl6/J mice with heart failure (HF), vs. sham-operated control (Sham-HF); (3) 2 month-old female C57Bl6/J mice with voluntary wheel training for 2 months (Run), vs. Sedentary control (Sed).

Lymphatic vessel growth and activation, mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor- (VEGF)-C and/or VEGF-A, play an important role in metastatic cancer spread and in chronic inflammation. We aimed to comprehensively identify downstream molecular targets induced by VEGF-A or VEGF-C in lymphatic endothelium. To this end, we treated human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) with VEGF-A or VEGF-C for up to 24 hours, followed by a time-series transcriptional profiling using gene microarray technology. We identified a number of genes - many of them not previously known to be involved in lymphangiogenesis - that clustered either as early response genes, transiently induced genes or progressively induced genes. Endothelial specific molecule-1 (ESM-1) was one of the genes that were most potently induced by both VEGF-A and VEGF-C.Keywords: Time course, growth factor comparison. Overnight serum starved human primary dermal microvascular lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC; passage 5-7) were stimulated with either VEGF-A or VEGF-C for 24 hours, 8 hours, 4 hours and 1 hour.

In addition, significant decreases were detected in serum levels of fatty acids, glycerol and triglycerides in P2Y13 knockout mice. mRNA profiling analyses showed that ablation of P2Y13 affects hepatic gene expression in a gender-specific manner. Non-supervised agglomerative cluster analysis showed that expression changes in mice with the same genotype (KO or WT) cluster together and that distinct gene expression clusters can be observed for males and females. Subsequent gene set enrichment analysis showed increased expression of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis genes, while fatty acid beta-oxidation genes were significantly decreased.

Inbred mice heterozygous for a null mutation in DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) or tripartite motif protein 28 (Trim28), show greater coefficients of variance in body weight than their wildtype littermates. Inbred mice carrying a mutation in Trim28 develop metabolic syndrome and abnormal behaviour with incomplete penetrance. These studies provide a molecular explanation of developmental noise in whole organisms and suggest that faithful epigenetic control of transcription is central to suppressing deleterious levels of phenotypic variation.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not only the fifth most prevalent cancer, presenting a major global health problem, but also among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide as its therapeutic targets are limited. To identify novel therapeutic targets, elucidate its oncogenic activities and molecular mechanism in HCC is urgent. We used R language edgeR package screened the expression profiles of 374 tissue samples obtained from patients with HCC and 50 samples of normal liver tissues obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Focusing on DDX24, we explored the functional effect and clinical significance of DDX24 in HCC. We provided evidence that DDX24 was a potential pro-tumorigenic gene in HCC. DDX24 knockdown inhibited HCC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, RFX8 was proved to be DDX24 promoter-binding protein that transcriptionally upregulated DDX24 expression. Furthermore, we found that DDX24 bound to, and increased the stability of, LAMB1 mRNA by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) sequencing and RNA sequencing. Survival analysis indicated that HCC patients with high DDX24, RFX8, or LAMB1 expression exhibited poor prognosis. Our results demonstrated that DDX24 promoted HCC via RFX8/DDX24/LAMB1 pathway, which can be exploited as potential therapeutic target against HCC. Hep3B cells were used for RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) sequencing.

Background and Aims: Gene expression analysis of colon biopsies using high-density oligonucleotide microarray can contribute to the understanding of local pathophysiological alterations and to functional classification of precancerous adenoma, different stage colorectal carcinomas (CRC) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).Results: Significant overexpression of collagen IV, lipocalin-2, caveolin-1, calumenin genes, and significant dowregulation of aquaporin-8, amnionless homolog, prostaglandin D2 receptor genes were detected in CRC patients compared to normal. Adenoma samples were characterized by upregulated CD44 antigen, met proto-oncogene and downregulated chemokine ligand-12, ADAM-like decysin-1 and ATP-binding casette A8 discriminatory genes. In IBD samples significantly increased lipocalin-2, interferon induced transmembrane protein 1 and 3 mRNA levels, decreased zinc finger protein 91 and transient receptor potential cation channel M6 mRNA levels were found.

The results indicated that reduced translation of cellular mRNAs played a key role in EV71-induced host shutoff rather than mRNA depletion.

    "text": "Selective Functions of Individual Zinc Fingers Within the DNA-Binding Domain of Ikaros (RNA-seq: Thymocytes). The C2H2 zinc finger is the most prevalent DNA-binding motif in the mammalian proteome, with DNA-binding domains usually containing more tandem fingers than are needed for stable sequence-specific DNA recognition. To examine the reason for the frequent presence of multiple zinc fingers, we generated mice lacking finger 1 or finger 4 of the 4-finger DNA-binding domain of Ikaros, a critical regulator of lymphopoiesis and leukemogenesis. Each mutant strain exhibited a specific subset of the phenotypes observed with Ikaros null mice. Of particular relevance, fingers 1 and 4 contributed to distinct stages of B- and T-cell development and finger 4 was selectively required for tumor suppression in thymocytes and in a new model of BCR-ABL+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia. These results, combined with transcriptome profiling (this GEO submission: RNA-Seg of whole thymus from wt and the two ZnF mutants), reveal that different subsets of fingers within multi-finger transcription factors can regulate distinct target genes and biological functions, and they demonstrate that selective mutagenesis can facilitate efforts to elucidate the functions and mechanisms of action of this prevalent class of factors.

Myocardial infarction (MI) triggers a reparative response involving fibroblast proliferation and differentiation driving extracellular matrix modulation necessary to form a stabilizing scar. Recently, it was shown that a genetic variant of the base excision repair enzyme endonuclease VIII-like 3 (NEIL3) was associated with increased risk of MI in humans. Here, we report elevated myocardial NEIL3 expression in heart failure patients and marked myocardial upregulation of Neil3 following MI in mice, especially in a fibroblast-enriched cell fraction. Neil3-/- mice showed increased mortality after MI compared to WT, caused by myocardial rupture. Neil3-/- hearts displayed enrichment of mutations in genes involved in mitogenesis of fibroblasts and transcriptome analysis revealed dysregulated fibrosis. Correspondingly, proliferation of vimentin+ and aSMA+ (myo)fibroblasts was increased in Neil3-/- hearts following MI. We propose that NEIL3 operates in genomic regions crucial for regulation of cardiac fibroblast proliferation and thereby controls extracellular matrix modulation after MI.

The HER2 (ERBB2) and MYC genes are commonly amplified genes in breast cancer, yet little is known about their molecular and clinical interaction. Using a novel chimeric mammary transgenic approach and in vitro models, we demonstrate markedly increased self renewal and tumour propagating capability of cells transformed with Her2 and c-Myc. Co-expression of both oncogenes in cultured cells led to a pronounced activation of a c-Myc transcriptional signature and acquisition of a self renewing phenotype independent of an EMT programme or regulation of cancer stem cell markers. We show that HER2 and c-MYC are frequently co-amplified in a clinical breast cancer cohort and that co-amplification is strongly associated with aggressive clinical behaviour and poor outcome. Lastly, we show that in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (but not targeted anti-HER2 therapy), MYC amplification is associated with a poor outcome in HER2+ breast cancer patients. These findings demonstrate the importance of molecular context in oncogenic transformation and acquisition of a malignant stem-like phenotype and have important diagnostic and therapeutic consequences for the clinical management of HER2+ breast cancer.

The use of nucleic acids from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues for high-throughput molecular techniques, such as microarray gene expression profiling has become widespread in molecular research area. However, working with FFPE tissues is challenging because of degradation, cross-linking with proteins, and RNA chemical modifications. Also, there is no generally accepted procedure for RNA extraction to microarray analysis. Thus, there is a need for a standardized workflow for FFPE samples to study microarray transcriptome profiling. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to conduct a standardized process from deparaffinization to RNA extraction and microarray gene expression analysis. Firstly, deparaffinization procedure was optimized for FFPE samples and then Trizol, PicoPure RNA isolation kit, and Qiagen RNeasy FFPE kit performances were compared in terms of yield and purity. Finally, two different cRNA/cDNA preparation and labeling protocols with two different array platforms (Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 and U133_X3P) were also evaluated to determine which combination gives the best percentage of present call. Our optimization study shows that the Qiagen RNeasy FFPE kit with modified deparaffinization step gives better results (RNA quantity and quality) than the other two isolation kits. The Ribo-SPIA protocol and U133_X3P array combination gave a significantly higher percentage of present calls than the 3' IVT cDNA amplification and labeling system. However, no significant differences were found between the two array platforms. These results present a workflow for microarray gene expression profiling of FFPE tissues. The findings also indicate that sufficient quality gene expression data can be obtained from FFPE-derived RNA. Four FFPE colon cancer tissue sections were used for this study. 4 sections (each 8 mm thick) were cut from each sample and used for RNA extractions. RNA amplifications were performed using the Affymetrix 3' IVT Kit and the NuGEN Ovation FFPE WTA system. Four different hybridization combinations were performed on four labeled samples which were amplified by two different kits. Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 and U133_X3P arrays were used for these four combinations. Three of these four samples have matched control samples. In this study gene expression data analysis was also performed to detect differentially expressed genes for these three matched samples. These three matched normal controls were independently isolated, amplified, fragmented and labeled for another larger microarray gene expression study using our optimized workflow. These samples were hybridized to same microarray platform (U133_X3P Array) as the matched tumor samples.",

Mutant KRAS and c-MYC are oncogenic drivers and rational therapeutic targets for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. While tumor growth and homeostasis is largely dependent on these oncogenes, a few residual cancer cells are able to survive the ablation of mutant KRAS and c-MYC. By performing a genome-wide gene expression analysis of in vivo-derived bulk tumor cells and residual cancer cells lacking the expression of mutant KRAS or c-MYC, we have identified an increase in autocrine IGF1/AKT signaling as a common survival mechanism in dormant cancer cells. The pharmacological inhibition of IGF-1R reduced residual disease burden and cancer recurrence, suggesting this molecular pathway is crucial for the survival of cancer cells in the absence of the primary oncogenic drivers.

Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of death in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and intracranial aneurysm (ICA) causing subarachnoid hemorrhage is among the most serious complications. The diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for ICAs in ADPKD have not been fully established. We here generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from seven ADPKD patients, including four with ICAs. The vascular cells differentiated from ADPKD-iPSCs showed altered Ca2+ entry and gene expression profiles compared with those from control-iPSCs. We found that the expression level of a metalloenzyme gene, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1, was specifically elevated in the iPSC-derived endothelia from ADPKD patients with ICAs. Furthermore, we confirmed a statistically significant correlation between the serum MMP1 levels and the development of ICAs in 354 ADPKD patients, indicating that the serum MMP1 levels may be a novel risk factor and become more beneficial when combined with other risk factors. These results suggest that cellular disease models with ADPKD-specific iPSCs can be used to study the disease mechanisms and to identify novel disease-related molecules or risk factors. The gene expression profiles of vascular endothelia and smooth muscle cells derived from control- and ADPKD-iPSCs were analyzed.

The b-adrenergic receptor signaling pathway is a major component of adaptive thermogenesis in brown and white adipose tissue during cold acclimation. The b-AR activation highly induces transcriptional coactivator PGC-1a and its splice variant N-terminal (NT)-PGC-1a, promoting the transcription program of mitochondrial biogenesis and thermogenesis. In the present study, we evaluated the role of NT-PGC-1a in brown adipocyte energy metabolism by genome-wide profiling of NT-PGC-1a-responsive genes. Canonical pathway analysis revealed that a number of genes upregulated by NT-PGC-1a are highly enriched in mitochondrial pathways including fatty acid transport and b-oxidation, TCA cycle and electron transport system, thus reinforcing the crucial role of NT-PGC-1a in the enhancement of mitochondrial function. Moreover, gene expression profiling of NT-PGC-1a revealed activation of distinct metabolic pathways such as glucose, lipid and nucleotide metabolism and of signaling pathways such as RAR and PPAR-g/RXRa activation in brown adipocytes. Together, our data strengthen our previous findings that NT-PGC-1a is a key regulator of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and thermogenesis in brown adipocytes and further suggest that NT-PGC-1a influences a broader spectrum of thermogenic processes to meet cellular needs for adaptive thermogenesis. Two samples from two groups: NT-PGC-1a overexpression and empty vector. There are technical replicates (A and B) for each group. Two RNA samples were pooled for each group.",

TREM2 and DAP12 constitute a receptor/adaptor complex expressed on osteoclasts, dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, and microglia. At present, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying development of leukoencephalopathy and bone cysts in NHD remain largely unknown. We established THP-1 human monocyte clones that stably express small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting DAP12 for serving as a cellular model of NHD. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis identified a set of 22 genes consistently downregulated in DAP12 knockdown cells. They constituted the molecular network closely related to the network defined by cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, hematological system development and function, and inflammatory response, where NF-kappaB acts as a central regulator. These results suggest that a molecular defect of DAP12 in human monocytes deregulates the gene network pivotal for maintenance of myeloid cell function in NHD. We found that both DAP12 knockdown and control clones were capable of equally responding to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a known inducer of morphological differentiation of THP-1 cells, by exhibiting almost similar gene expression profiles between both, following a 24-hour exposure to 50 nM PMA.

We found that loci transcribing novel lncRNAs were not randomly distributed across the genome but co-localized with leukocyte transcriptional enhancers, especially super-enhancers, and near genetic variants associated with autoimmune disease risk. We propose that alterations in enhancer function, including lncRNA expression, produced by genetics and environment, change cellular phenotypes contributing to disease risk and pathogenesis and represent attractive therapeutic targets. We extracted RNA from peripheral whole blood across healthy control and disease subjects.",

Exosomal microRNAs have recently been studied as potential diagnostic marker for various malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to investigate serum exosomal microRNA profiles as HCC diagnostic marker. Transmission electron microscopy and western blot were used to identify serum exosomes. Deep sequencing was performed to screen differentially expressed microRNAs between HCC (n=5) and liver cirrhosis (LC, n=5) group. Three upregulated and two downregulated microRNAs were selected for qPCR analysis. The levels of selected microRNAs were normalized to Caenorhabditis elegans miR-39 microRNA mimics. Serum exosomal level of miR-122, miR-148a, and miR-1246 were further analyzed and significantly higher in HCC than LC and normal control (NC) group (P<0.001), but not different from chronic hepatitis group(p>0.05). The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate diagnostic perfromance of candidate microRNAs. Area under the curve (AUC) of miR-148a was 0.891 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.809-0.947] in discriminating HCC from LC, remarkably higher than alpha fetoprotein (AFP) (AUC: 0.712, 95 % CI: 0.607-0.803). Binary logistic regression was adpoted to establish the diagnostic model for discriminating HCC from LC. And the combination of miR-122, miR-148a and AFP increased the AUC to 0.931 (95% CI, 0.857-0.973), which can also be applied for distinguishing early HCC from LC. miR-122 was the best for differentiating HCC from NC (AUC: 0.990, 95% CI, 0.945-1.000). These data suggests that serum exosomal microRNAs signature or their combination with traditional biomarker may be used as a suitable peripheral screening tool for HCC. Deep sequencing was performed to screen differentially expressed serum exosomal microRNAs between HCC (n=5) and liver cirrhosis (LC, n=5) group.",

Background: Breastfed human infants are predominantly colonized by bifidobacteria that thrive on human milk oligosaccharides (HMO). The two most predominant species of bifidobacteria in infant feces are Bifidobacterium breve (B. breve) and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis (B. infantis), both avid HMO-consumer strains. Our laboratory has previously shown that B. infantis, when grown on HMO, increase adhesion to intestinal cells and increase the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effects of carbon source--glucose, lactose, or HMO--on the ability of B. breve and B. infantis to adhere to and affect the transcription of intestinal epithelial cells on a genome-wide basis.Results: HMO-grown B. infantis had higher percent binding to Caco-2 cell monolayers compared to B. infantis grown on glucose or lactose. B. breve had low adhesive ability regardless of carbon source. Despite differential binding ability, both HMO-grown strains significantly differentially affected the Caco-2 transcriptome compared to their glucose or lactose grown controls. HMO-grown B. breve and B. infantis both down-regulated genes in Caco-2 cells associated with chemokine activity.Conclusion: The choice of carbon source affects the interaction of bifidobacteria with intestinal epithelial cells. HMO-grown bifidobacteria reduce markers of inflammation, compared to glucose or lactose-grown bifidobacteria. In the future, the design of preventative or therapeutic probiotic supplements may need to include appropriately chosen prebiotics. CACO-2 cells incubated with Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis grown on (1) glucose, (2) lactose, or (3) human milk oligosaccharides. All experiments were run in triplicate.",

Neuronal types in the central nervous system differ dramatically in their resilience to injury or insults. Here we studied selective resilience in mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) following optic nerve crush (ONC), which severs their axons and leads to death of ~80% of RGCs in 2 weeks. To identify expression programs associated with differential resilience, we first used single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to generate a comprehensive molecular atlas of 45 RGC types in adult retina. We tracked their survival after ONC, characterized transcriptomic, morphological, and physiological changes that preceded degeneration, and identified genes selectively expressed by each type. Finally, loss- and gain-of-function assays in vivo showed that manipulating some of these genes improved neuronal survival and axon regeneration following ONC. This study provides a systematic framework for parsing type-specific responses to injury, and demonstrates that these responses can be used to reveal molecular targets for intervention. In these experiments, we FACS sorted for retinal ganglion cells using a combination of a transgenic reporter (VGLUT2) and a surface protein (CD90) from dissociated retinas of adult (6-8 wk old) mice.",

Background: Histone deacetylase (HDAC) is strongly associated with epigenetic regulation and carcinogenesis, and its inhibitors induce the differentiation or apoptosis of cancer cells. Valproic acid (VPA) is one of the clinically available HDAC inhibitors. We investigated the anticancer effects of VPA in combination with gemcitabine (GEM) in cholangiocarcinoma cell line, and explored the mechanisms of the anticancer effects using microarray analysis. Methods: A human cholangiocarcinoma cell line (HuCCT1) was used. The anticancer effects of VPA, or gemcitabine (GEM), and the effects of VPA combined with GEM, were studied by cell proliferation assay. The microarray analysis was performed, the genes were picked up using Gene Spring GX11.5, Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) was performed, and then the gene-expression was determined by RT-PCR. Results: GEM (5nM) and VPA (0.5mM) reduced by 23%, which significantly augmented the anticancer effect of GEM alone or VPA alone (P<0.01). Using the microarray analysis, forty-three genes were identified with the comparison between GEM group and GEM plus VPA combination group. The interactions were shown between genes of the \"Cellular Development\" relevant to the differentiation of cancer cell using IPA. Total RNA was isolated from both the stimulated and unstimulated cells (HuCCT-1) using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Relative purity was examined using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). RNA expression was analyzed using GeneChip*R Human Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), containing 28,869 oligonucleotide probes for known and unknown genes. First standard cDNA was synthesized from 300 ng of total RNA by using GeneChip*R Whole Transcript (WT) cDNA Synthesis and Amplification Kit (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 mg of cRNA were input into the second-cycle cDNA reaction. cDNA was fragmented and end-labeled with the GeneChip*R WT Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix).

Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Latent Membrane Protein 1 (LMP1) transforms rodent fibroblasts and is expressed in most EBV-associated malignancies. LMP1 Transformation Effector Site 2 (TES2)/C-Terminal Activation Region 2 (CTAR2) activates NF-kappaB, p38, JNK, ERK and IRF7 pathways. We have investigated LMP1 TES2 genome-wide RNA effects at 4 time points after LMP1 TES2 expression in HEK 293 cells. Using a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of < 0.001 after correction for multiple hypotheses, LMP1 TES2 caused > 2-fold changes in 1916 mRNAs; 1479 RNAs were up-regulated and 437 down-regulated. In contrast to TNFalpha stimulation, which transiently up-regulates many target genes, LMP1 TES2 maintained most RNA effects through the time course, despite robust and sustained induction of negative feedback regulators, such as IkappaBalpha and A20. LMP1 TES2 regulated RNAs encode many NF-kappaB signaling proteins and secondary interacting proteins. Consequently, many LMP1 TES2-regulated RNAs encode proteins that form an extensive interactome. Gene Set Enrichment Analyses found LMP1 TES2 up-regulated genes to be significantly enriched for Pathways in Cancer, B-and T-cell receptor signaling, and Toll-like receptor signaling. Surprisingly, LMP1 TES2 and IkappaBalpha super-repressor co-expression decreased LMP1 TES2 RNA effects to only 5 RNAs with FDR<0.001 and >2 fold change. Thus, canonical NF-kappaB activation is critical for almost all LMP1 TES2 RNA effects in HEK-293 cells and a more significant therapeutic target than previously appreciated. An LMP1 double point mutant (P204A, Q206A) was used to construct a HEK-293 TET-On LMP1 TES2 cell line. Stable cell clones were selected that carry an inducible system for LMP1 TES2 expression. The Tet-system is composed of three parts: 1) the LMP1 TES2 cDNA cloned into the tetracycline-regulated pJEF vector; 2) a tetracycline suppressor (tTS) that binds Tet-operator sites in the absence of tetracyclines and silences expression; 3) a reverse-tetracycline transactivator fused to the 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4HT) ligand binding domain (rTTA M2). LMP1 expression was induced by addition of doxycycline (1 ug/ml) and 4HT (100 nM). For simultaneous inducible expression of LMP1 TES2 and an IkBa super-repressor, a stable cell line was derived. A pJEF vector encoding IkBa residues 37-317 was introduced into the inducible LMP1 TES2 cell line. Cell lines were cultured with DMEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% tetracycline-free serum (Clontech). LMP1 expression was induced by addition of tetracycline (1 ug/ml). RNA samples were collected from triplicate samples using RNABee (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions from 293 cells induced for LMP1 TES2 (and IkBa super-repressor, where indicated) expression at 0, 6, 9, 12 and 24 hours of induction. Cells were in the log-phase of growth. Gene expression profiles were assayed using the Affymetrix HU-133 plus2 GeneChip according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time RT-PCR was performed with the Power SYBR Green RNA-to-CT(tm) 1-Step Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

Chronic CD8 T-cell stimulation in persisting infections or tumors can induce a stable gene expression program, known as T-cell dysfunction or exhaustion, that limits the cell's effector functions and anti-viral and anti-tumor immunity. Thus far, the underlaying molecular mechanisms that induce and stabilize this phenotype are vaguely understood. We report here that establishing this program requires the thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group-box protein (Tox). Genetic disruption of Tox augments effector function, decreases the expression of PD-1, and significantly enhances immunopathology. These changes are linked to a failure in fixing the dysfunctional phenotype in the critical Tcf1+ progenitor population and to impaired epigenetic programing. Surprisingly, the gains in effector function co-incide with declining numbers of Tcf1+ cells and result ultimately in reduced total numbers of pathogen-specific T-cells. Thus, we establish Tox as a critical factor for the development of T-cell dysfunction and establish a clear link between CD8 T-cell intrinsic suppression of effector function and protection against immune-pathology.The terms acute and chronic samples refer to P14 T-cells that were initially activated in acute LCMV (Armstrong) or chronic LCMV (clone-13) infections. 4 weeks later, the P14 T cells were collected, transferred into naive mice, and both then re-expanded in acute LCMV (Armstrong) infection. 8 days later P14 T-cells were collected and analysed. 2*10^3 wt P14 T-cells were transferred into C57BL6 host, infected with 2x10^5 PFU LCMV Armstrong or 2x10^6 PFU LCMV-c13 and collected on day 28.

Purpose: Compare the transcriptome of homogeneous XIST+ and XIST- hES cell populations.Methods: We isolated homogeneous XIST+ and XIST- cell populations. The XIST+ cells correspond to cells with a XIST cloud and one ATRX pinpoint. The XIST- cells correspond to cells with no XIST cloud and one ATRX pinpoint.Results: We took advantage of the clonal pattern of X-chromosome inactivation in H9 cells and analyzed the data in an allelic manner. By comparing the RNA-Seq data with known H9 SNPs, we identified genomic positions which were relaxed from XCI in XIST- cells compared to XIST+ cells.Conclusions: Genic as well as unannotated transcripts are massively relaxed from XCI in H9 cells when XIST expression is lost, however, this reactivation is only partial and a large region around the centromere is protected from relaxation of silencing.

    "text": "Periodontal regeneration study. Periodontal regeneration study.Periodontitis is a common chronic inflammatory disease which may lead to tooth loss. The ultimate goal of periodontal therapy is complete regeneration of the tissues lost as a result of periodontitis. However, most regenerative clinical procedures are unpredictable, largely because there is a lack of understanding of how the various tissues comprising the periodontium (gingival epithelium, gingival connective tissue, periodontal ligament, aveolar bone and cementum) interact during the regenerative process.The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms that are involved in periodontal regeneration. For this purpose, paired sets of gingival, ligament and regenerating cells were isolated from patients that have been treated for periodontitis via a regenerative surgical procedure. A microarray analysis using the Hu133A Affymetrix arrays was used to identify the genes and pathways that were characteristic of the three different tissues. We have identified over 500 transcripts in global comparison and intrapatient comparisons that were differentially expressed between ligament and gingival samples, and approximately 30 transcripts that characterized the regenerating cell population. By using a functional classification based on Gene Ontology we were able to group the transcripts into 12 groups. Proteases/Protease inhibitors were differentially expressed between the ligament and gingiva highlighting high ECM remodelling activity by gingival cells. On the other hand, ligament cells were shown to have increased protein synthesis by increasing their nucleolar and ribosomal gene complement. We were able to identify 57 various DNA binding proteins, among them were some well characterised transcription factors, transcriptional regulators, including DNA polymerases and transcriptional co-activators. Furthermore, we have also identified changes in expression of their targets in the two tissues.This is the first study to characterise the gene expression profile of periodontal regenerating cells and allowed us to gain valuable insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that occur during the regenerative process. We have identified signalling pathways which are consistent with clinical observations of the regenerative properties of gingival and periodontal ligament cells. These pathways provide candidate targets that can be manipulated in order to achieve a superior regenerative clinical outcome.Keywords: other.",

The inner lining of the human uterus, termed the endometrium, is replete with glands that are hypothesized to be important for establishment of pregnancy through interactions with other endometrial cells and the embryo. A three-dimensional culture system was utilized to establish and generate endometrial epithelial organoids from normal human endometrium that display long-term expandability, can be cryopreserved, and are hormone responsive. Here, single cell RNA-seq was used to create a high-resolution gene expression atlas of the endometrial epithelial organoids and to define responsiveness to reproductive hormones. In order to investigate the roles of uterine glands in first trimester human pregnancy, we used an established protocol of Matrigel and WNT-activating conditions to generate three-dimensional human uterine gland organoid (HUGO) cultures from endometrial biopsies.

E-cadherin, a protein encoded by the CDH1 gene is the dominant epithelial cell adhesion molecule playing a crucial role in epithelial tissue polarity and structural integrity. The progression of 90% or more carcinomas is believed to be mediated by disruption of normal E-cadherin expression, subcellular localization or function. Despite the strong correlation between E-cadherin loss and malignancy the mechanism through how this occurs is not known in most sporadic and hereditary epithelial carcinomas. Previous works have shown the importance of CDH1 intron 2 sequences for proper gene and protein expression supporting the possibility of these being cis-modulators of E-cadherin expression/function. but when co-expressed it led to reduced cell-cell adhesiveness, increased invasion and angiogenesis. By expression array analysis, IFITM1 and IFI27 levels were found to be increased upon CDH1a overexpression. Importantly, CDH1a was found to be de novo expressed in gastric cancer cell lines when compared to normal stomach.Results: In this sense we have searched for additional CDH1 transcripts arising from intron 2. From the four found, one (CDH1a) was demonstrated to be tissue specific and to be translated in vivo.

    "text": "Wip1 regulates adult neurogenesis and Wnt signaling during aging. The number of newly-formed neurons declines rapidly during aging. Here we describe an important mechanism that contributes to this decline via Wip1-dependent regulation of neuronal differentiation. We found that Wip1 is expressed in neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) of the mouse subventricular zone and its upregulation at physiological levels maintained higher NPC numbers and neuronal differentiation in old mice. This resulted in markedly improved neuron formation and rescued a functional defect in fine odor discrimination in old mice. We identified Dkk3 as a key downstream target of Wip1 and found that its expression in SVZ is restricted to NPCs. Functionally, Dkk3 inhibited neuroblast formation by suppressing Wnt signaling, while deletion of Dkk3 or pharmacological reactivation of the Wnt pathway improved neuron formation and olfactory function in aged mice. We propose that Wip1 controls a Dkk3-dependent inhibition of neuronal differentiation during aging and thus regulating Wip1 levels could prevent certain aspects of functional decline of the aging brain.We found if neurospheres were derived from 18 months old mice, Wip1 transgenic neurospheres were more neurogenic than wt ones. This microarray was a pilot experiment to search the mechanism how Wip1 Transgene promoted neurogenesis, and found Dkk3 as a potential mediator.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of HD provide an opportunity to study the mechanisms underlying disease pathology in patient tissues relevant to disease. Murine studies have demonstrated that HTT is intricately involved in corticogenesis, and mutant (mt) HTT cannot compensate for the loss of non-CAG-expanded HTT. However, the critical effect of mtHTT in human corticogenesis has not yet been specifically explored and due to inherent differences in cortical development and timing between humans and mice. We therefore differentiated HD and non-diseased iPSCs into functional cortical neurons. While HD patient iPSCs can be successfully differentiated towards a cortical fate in culture, the resulting neurons display transcriptomic, morphological and functional phenotypes indicative of altered neurodevelopment. This is the first demonstration of altered corticogenesis from HD human patient cells, further supporting the potential neurodevelopmental aspect of HD.

In space, multiple unique environmental factors, particularly microgravity and space radiation, pose constant threat to the astronaut's health. To gain insight into the role of miRNAs and lncRNAs in response to radiation and microgravity, we analyzed RNA expression profiles in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells incubated for 24 h in static condition or in rotating condition to stimulate microgravity in space after 2 Gy g-ray irradiation. Expression of 14 lncRNAs and 17 mRNAs was found to be significantly down-regulated in the simulated microgravity condition. In contrast, irradiation up-regulated the expression of 55 lncRNAs and 56 mRNAs, while only one lncRNA, but no mRNA, was down-regulated. Furthermore, 2 miRNAs, 70 lncRNAs, and 87 mRNAs showed significantly altered expression under simulated microgravity after irradiation, and these changes were independently induced by irradiation and simulated microgravity. Together, our results indicate that simulated microgravity and irradiation additively and independently alter the expression of RNAs and their target genes in human lymphoblastoid cells.

Several functions have been suggested for the interferon induced transmembrane protein 1 (Iftitm1) gene in mammals. Originally it was identified as a member of a gene family that is highly inducible by type I and type II inteferons. Based on its expression during primordial germ CELl (PGC) specification it was suggested to be required for normal PGC migration. Ifitm1 targeted knockdown experiments in mouse embryos provided evidence that the gene might be necessary for normal somitogenesis. Finally, the complete deletion of the Ifitm gene cluster on mouse chromosome 7 revealed that the five deleted Ifitm1 genes are not essential for PCG migration and fertility. Here, we generated a novel targeted knockin allele of the Ifitm1 gene by replacing its coding region with a lacZ reporter gene to systematically reassess the suggested functions of this gene.We find that during embryogenesis somites and in the adult the vertebral column appear normal in homozygous Ifitm1 knockout mice, strongly suggesting that Ifitm1 is not essential for normal segmentation of the paraxial mesoderm. In addition, homozygous Ifitm1 mutant mice are fertile, reproduce normally and have normal sperm quality. Furthermore, we show that the Ifitm1 loss-of-function allele does not cause immunological mutant phenotypes in unchallenged as well as in Listeria challenged homozygous mutant animals. To further focus on unique functional requirements of Ifitm1, we took advantage of the lacZ reporter gene in the Ifitm1 locus to analyze for the first time in detail and with high sensitivity its complex expression pattern in mouse embryos from E8.5 to E14.5 and in adult organs. The detailed description of the Ifitm1 expression domains will support the identification of organs that might be affected by the loss of Ifitm1 function. We performed gene expression microarray analysis of ten lung tissues from male adult Ifitm1-deficient and control mice.",

We hypothesised that anakinra, a recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist, improves beta-cell function in patients with new-onset T1D. Methods: In an individually randomised, two-group parallel trial involving 14 European tertiary referral centers, 69 patients aged 18-35 with T1D, < 12 weeks of symptoms, and standard mixed meal test (MMT) stimulated C-peptide >= 200 pM were enrolled between January, 2009 and July, 2011 and assigned by centralised computer-generated blocked randomisation with locked computer-file concealment to treatment with 100 mg anakinra (n=35) subcutaneously once daily or placebo (n=34) for 9 months as add-on to conventional therapy. Participants and care-givers, but not data monitoring unit, were masked to group assignment. The primary end-point was change in the two-hour area-under-the-curve C-peptide response to MMT, and secondary end-points changes in insulin requirements, glycaemia, and inflammatory markers at one, three, six, and nine months. Findings: The study was prematurely terminated due to slow accrual and is closed to follow-up. No interim analysis was performed. Ten patients withdrew in the anakinra and eight in the placebo arm, leaving 25 and 26 patients to be analysed, respectively. There was no statistical difference in adverse event category reporting between arms. Interpretation: Anakinra-treatment in T1D was safe, but the trial failed to meet primary and secondary outcome measures.

Therapies that boost the anti-tumor responses of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) have shown promise in the clinic. However, clinical responses to currently available immunotherapeutic agents vary considerably, for which the molecular basis is unclear. To date, unbiased transcriptomic studies of CTLs in human cancers have been performed in whole tumors or cells obtained from peripheral blood or metastatic sites of heavily pre-treated patients. We performed global transcriptional profiling of CTLs in tumors and adjacent non-tumor tissue from treatment-naive patients with early stage lung cancer to define the molecular features associated with robustness of anti-tumor immune responses. We observed major differences in the transcriptional program of tumor-infiltrating CTLs that are shared across tumor subtypes. Pathway analysis revealed enrichment of genes in cell cycle, T cell receptor (TCR) activation and co-stimulation pathways, indicating tumor-driven expansion of presumed tumor antigen-specific CTLs. We also observed marked heterogeneity in the expression of molecules associated with TCR activation and immune checkpoints such as 4-1BB, PD1, TIM3, and their expression was positively correlated with the density of tumor-infiltrating CTLs. Interestingly, transcripts linked to tissue-resident memory cells (TRM), such as CD103, were enriched in tumors containing a high density of CTLs, and CTLs from CD103high tumors displayed features of enhanced cytotoxicity, implying better anti-tumor activity. In an independent cohort of 689 lung cancer patients, we confirmed that patients with CD103high (TRM rich) tumors survived significantly longer. In summary, we define the molecular fingerprint of tumor-infiltrating CTLs at the site of primary tumor and identify a number of novel targets that may be important in modulating the magnitude and specificity of anti-tumor immune responses in lung cancer.

Chronic fatiguing illness remains a poorly understood syndrome of unknown pathogenesis. We attempted to identify biomarkers for chronic fatiguing illness using microarrays to query the transcriptome in peripheral blood leukocytes. Methods. Cases were 44 individuals who were clinically evaluated and found to meet standard international criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome or idiopathic chronic fatigue, and controls were their monozygotic co-twins who were clinically evaluated and never had even one month of impairing fatigue. Biological sampling conditions were standardized and RNA stabilizing media were used. These methodological features provide rigorous control for bias resulting from case-control mismatched ancestry and experimental error. Individual gene expression profiles were assessed using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Findings. There were no significant differences in gene expression for any transcript. Conclusions. Contrary to our expectations, we were unable to identify a biomarker for chronic fatiguing illness in the transcriptome of peripheral blood leukocytes suggesting that positive findings in prior studies may have resulted from experimental bias. Cases were 44 individuals who were clinically evaluated and found to meet standard international criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome or idiopathic chronic fatigue, and controls were their monozygotic co-twins who were clinically evaluated and never had even one month of impairing fatigue.",

Sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate, is part of an important group of naturally occurring small molecules with antiinflammatory properties. Even though the published reports are vague, most are best conceivable with an inhibition of T cell functions. We therefore analyzed the effect of SFN on T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Feeding mice with SFN protected from severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Disease amelioration was associated with reduced interleukin (IL)-17 and IFN-gamma expression in draining lymph nodes. In vitro, SFN treatment of T cells did not directly alter T cell cytokine secretion. In contrast, SFN treatment of dendritic cells (DC) inhibited TLR4-induced IL-12 and IL-23 production and the cytokine profile of T cells stimulated by SFN-treated DC. SFN suppressed TLR4-induced nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) activity, without affecting the degradation of its inhibitor (IkB). Instead, SFN treatment of DC resulted in strong expression of the stress response protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which interacts with NFkB p65 and inhibits its activity. Consistent with these findings, HO-1 bound to p65 and subsequently inhibited the p65 promoter activity within the IL23a and IL12b promoter region. Importantly, SFN suppressed Il23a and Il12b expression in vivo and silenced Th17/Th1 responses within the CNS . Our data show that SFN improves Th17/Th1-mediated autoimmune disease by inducing HO-1 and inhibiting p65-regulated IL-23 and IL-12 expression.

    "text": "Hic-5 regulates epithelial to mesenchymal transition in ovarian cancer cells in a TGFb1-independent manner. The molecular basis of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) dissemination is still poorly understood. We have previously identified the hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone-5 (Hic-5) gene as hypomethylated in high-grade (HG) serous EOC tumors, compared to normal ovarian tissues. Hic-5 is a focal adhesion scaffold protein and has been primarily studied for its role as a key mediator of TGF-b-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in epithelial cells of both normal and malignant origin; however, its role in EOC has been never investigated.Here we demonstrate that Hic-5 is overexpressed in advanced EOC, and that Hic-5 is upregulated upon TGFb1 treatment in the EOC cell line with epithelial morphology (A2780s), associated with EMT induction. However, ectopic expression of Hic-5 in A2780s induces alone EMT, accompanied with enhancement of their proliferation rate and migratory/invasive capacity and increased resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, Hic-5 knockdown in the EOC cell lines with mesenchymal morphology (SKOV3), was accompanied by induction of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), followed by a reduction of their proliferative, migratory and invasive capacity, and increased drugs sensitivity in vitro and enhanced tumor cell colonization and metastatic growth in vivo. The modulation of Hic-5 expression in EOC cells resulted in altered regulation of numerous EMT-related canonical pathways and was indicative for a possible role of Hic-5 in controlling EMT through a RhoA/ROCK mediated mechanism.To our knowledge, this is the first report examining the role of Hic-5 in EOC, and its role in maintaining the mesenchymal phenotype of EOC cells independently of exogenous TGFb1 treatment. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of Hic-5 gene action in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), we employed the Agilent Whole Human Genome microarrays, containing ~ 44,000 genes to identify global gene expression changes upon Hic-5 suppression in SKOV3 EOC cells and Hic-5 overexpression in A2780s cells. We compared the gene expression of the previously selected shRNA-mediated Hic-5 -knockdown clones sh-S1 and sh-S2 and the ectopically Hic-5 expressing clone pCMV-Hic-5 against the corresponding control (C) clones . The microarray experiments were performed in duplicates, as two hybridizations were carried out for each of the Hic-5-suppressing cell clones and the Hic-5-overexpressing clone against the corresponding controls, using a fluorescent dye reversal (dye-swap) technique.",

Dietary gluten proteins (prolamins) from wheat, rye, and barley are the driving forces behind celiac disease, an organ-specific autoimmune disorder that targets both the small intestine and organs outside the gut. In the small intestine, gluten induces inflammation and a typical morphological change of villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia. Gut lesions improve and heal when gluten is excluded from the diet and the disease relapses when patients consume gluten. Oral immune tolerance towards gluten may be kept for years or decades before breaking tolerance in genetically susceptible individuals. Celiac disease provides a unique opportunity to study autoimmunity and the transition in immune cells as gluten breaks oral tolerance. Seventy-three celiac disease patients on a long-term gluten-free diet ingested a known amount of gluten daily for six weeks. A peripheral blood sample and intestinal biopsies were taken before and six weeks after initiating the gluten challenge. Biopsy results were reported on a continuous numeric scale that measured the villus height to crypt depth ratio to quantify gluten-induced gut mucosal injury. Pooled B and T cells were isolated from whole blood, and RNA was analyzed by DNA microarray looking for changes in peripheral B- and T-cell gene expression that correlated with changes in villus height to crypt depth, as patients maintained or broke oral tolerance in the face of a gluten challenge. Whole blood sample were taken before and six weeks after a gluten challenge in 73 patients with celiac disease. B and T cells were purified from whole blood using anti-CD3 and anti-CD19 conjugated magnetic beads.

However, there are currently no effective targeted therapies for this tumor type. The bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) family of proteins are transcriptional regulators that serve as scaffolds to facilitate gene transcription by binding to acetylated lysine residues in the N-terminal tail of histones. BET/BRD proteins have emerged as therapeutic targets in a broad range of tumors. We found that BET proteins are overexpressed in NRAS mutant melanoma, and that high levels of BET family member BRD4 are associated with poor patient survival, suggesting that BRD4 plays a key role in melanoma. Consequently, we hypothesized that these epigenetic regulators constitute potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited for melanoma treatment. We found that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of BET/BRD proteins decreases viability and inhibits proliferation of NRAS mutant melanoma cells, as well as BRAF/MEK-inhibitor resistant melanoma cells harboring concurrent BRAF/NRAS mutations. However, BET inhibitors when used as single agents were either cytostatic (in vitro) or ineffective (in vivo). We therefore evaluated combinations that could maximize the efficacy of BET inhibitors in NRAS mutant melanoma. Here we report that co-targeting BET and MEK synergistically restrained tumor growth and significantly prolonged the survival of NRAS-mutant tumor bearing mice. RNA-sequencing and RPPA analysis revealed that co-treatment with BETi/MEKi synergistically downregulated cell cycle regulators and activated caspase-7. This study demonstrates that combined BET and MEK inhibition elicits robust synergistic therapeutic effects and supports the clinical utility of this combination therapy for NRAS mutant melanoma patients.

HILPDA deficiency markedly reduced intracellular lipid levels and accumulation of fluorescently-labeled fatty acids. Decreased lipid storage in HILPDA-deficient macrophages could be rescued by inhibition of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and was associated with increased oxidative metabolism. In diet-induced obese mice, HILPDA deficiency did not alter inflammatory and metabolic parameters, despite markedly reducing lipid accumulation in macrophages.

Unlike many other cancers, estrogen receptor-alpha (ER+) breast cancers are associated with cumulative risks of recurrence and death that persist for decades. We show that molecular differences between breast cancers that recur at distant sites early (2 3 years) or late (3 5 years) support a robust molecular predictor of recurrence with Tamoxifen therapy and provide novel insights into the signaling features that differ between these recurrent cancers. We applied a support vector machine with recursive feature elimination to gene expression microarray data using a training-internal crossvalidation workflow that minimizes the gene selection bias problem. The resulting predictor was validated in an independent data set. Performance of the predictor suggests that it is possible to identify patients at increased risk of experiencing an early recurrence who require other treatments to prevent early metastasis. We implemented a Metropolis Sampling algorithm as a random walk to identify the protein-protein interactions (PPI) most closely associated with ER in 8 PPI databases. We then walked the gene expression data for the top PPIs to discover a signaling network driving early and late recurrent breast cancers. Consensus features between the training and validation datasets define a complex and highly connected network with major interactions among nodes including AR, CALD1, CALM(1,2,3), CDK1, EGFR, ESR1, ESR2, MAPK1, and SRC.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most advanced form of a large subset of brain tumors collectively known as glioma, is the most aggressive and invasive type of brain tumor. Patients usually experience a median survival range of 9 to 12 months. GBMs are extremely difficult to manage because of the tumor cells' tendency to migrate and pervade into adjacent tissues. Surgical resection of GBMs generally only slows disease progression because any remaining tumor cells proceed to migrate through brain tissues and reform a new tumor mass. It is hypothesized that the invasive phenotype of these tumor cells may be attributable to unique gene expression. Stationary core and invasive rim tumor cells were collected separately by laser capture microdissection (LCM) from 19 biopsy samples. Identification of differentially expressed genes in the tumor core and invasive rim can give valuable insight to the genes and pathways potentially involved with the invasive phenotype. This information can then be used to generate possible biomarkers, diagnostic markers, or drug targets. Human glioblastoma tumor samples were obtained from patients who underwent primary therapeutic brain tumor resection. All specimens were collected and submitted to the study under institutional review board approved protocols. None of the patients had been subjected to chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to resection, in order to avoid genetic signatures that are due to exposure to alkylating agents and/or ionizing radiation. All specimens were verified as GBMs by a neuropathologist.Tumors are embedded in OCT, then sectioned in a cryostat at -20C, to a thickness of 8-10 um and placed onto HistoGene slides.

The CapSure(tm) Macro LCM Caps LCM 0211 should be used with the AutoPix instrument. Cells in the tumor core are identified by nuclear atypia and size and captured using the larger spot sizes. Tumor cells immediately adjacent to necrotic areas, cortical areas, cells with small regular nuclei, endothelial and blood cells should be avoided. Individual white matter invading GBM cells can be identified by means of their nuclear atypia and heteropyknotic staining, which is consistent with that of the cells within the tumor core. They should be microdissected using the 7.5 um laser spot size and the initial power settings recommended by the PixCell II manual. After microdissection all harvested material should immediately be lysed on the cap by applying the lysis buffer (XB) from the PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit according to the PicoPure protocol and stored -80C. Cell populations harvested on different caps can be pooled at the time of RNA isolation. RNA integrity is varified by identification of distinct 28S and 18S ribosomal bands with an Agilent Bioanalyzer using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kit.Total RNA was isolated from 2000 LCM cells (to ensure at least 500 ng total RNA) using the PicoPure RNA solation Kit, following manufacturers protocol. mRNA is reverse transcribed with the RiboAmp RNA Amplification kit.500 ng total RNA is amplified with the RiboAmp RNA Amplification kit, following manufacturer's instructions. The total yield that can be expected falls between 30 and 60 ug copy RNA. The size of the copy RNA should be verified by gel electrophoresis. Approximately 500ng of copy RNA can be separated on a 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer. A smear of amplified material should be seen between 200 and 3000bp. Six ug amplified RNA are labeled in a RT with SuperScriptIII in the presence of dUTP Cy5 utilizing 6 ug random hexamers as primers. Universal reference RNA is amplified one round in the same manner and labeled with Cy3 dUTP. Labeled cDNA is hybridized overnight onto cDNA microarray. Following hybridization, arrays are washed, scanned and quantitated with the Axon GenePix 4000 microarray reader (Axon Instruments). Gene expression results are analyzed using GeneSpring (Silicon Genetics) software. Intensity dependent normalization is applied, where the ratio is reduced to the residual Lowess fit of the intensity versus ratio curve. The measured intensity of each gene is divided by its reference channel (signal from the universal reference RNA) in each sample. When the reference channel is below 10, the data point is considered uninformative. The ratios (sample over reference) for the tumor core experiments and invasive rim experiments are averaged and compared. Genes that are more than two-fold differentially regulated in the majority of the matched core/invasive rim sets are selected.",

Aberrant activation of RAS/MAPK signaling is a driver of over one third of all human carcinomas. The homologous transcription factors ETS1 and ETS2 mediate the activation of gene expression programs downstream of RAS/MAPK signaling. ETS1 is important for oncogenesis in many tumor types. However, ETS2 can act as an oncogene in some cellular backgrounds, and as a tumor suppressor in others, and the molecular mechanism responsible for this cell-type specific function remains unknown. Here, we show that ETS1 and ETS2 regulate a cell migration gene expression program in opposite directions, and provide the first comparison of the ETS1 and ETS2 cistromes. This genomic data, and an ETS1 deletion line are used to show that the opposite function of ETS2 is due to binding site competition and a weaker activation function of ETS2 compared to ETS1. This weaker activation was mapped to the ETS2 N-terminus and a specific interaction with the co-repressor BS69 (ZMYND11). Gene expression data from tumor cohorts was then used to show that BS69 expression level in tumors correlates with oncogenic and tumor suppressive roles of ETS2. Therefore, these data indicate a novel and specific mechanism allowing ETS2 to switch between oncogenic and tumor suppressive functions in a cell-type specific manner. mRNA profiles of ETS2 knockdown DU145 cells were generated using deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina NextSeq. Knockdowns were stable shRNA expression from a lentiviral construct selected with puromycin.This series includes re-analysis of three luciferase shRNA samples from GSE59020.",

Knockdown of TCTP reduced colony formation and increased apoptosis in LNCaP cells, implicating it as an important factor for prostate cancer cell growth. Global gene expression profiling in TCTP knockdown LNCaP cells showed that several interferon regulated genes are regulated by TCTP, suggesting that it may have a role in regulating immune function in prostate cancer. In addition, recombinant TCTP treatment increased colony formation in LNCaP cells suggesting that secreted TCTP may function as a proliferative factor in prostate cancer.

MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small, non-coding RNAs mediating post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. miRNAs have recently been implicated in hippocampus-dependent functions such as learning and memory, although the roles of individual miRNAs in these processes remain largely unknown. Here, we achieved stable inhibition using AAV-delivered miRNA sponges of individual, highly expressed and brain-enriched miRNAs; miR-124, miR-9 and miR-34, in hippocampal neurons. Molecular and cognitive studies revealed a role for miR-124 in learning and memory. Inhibition of miR-124 resulted in an enhanced spatial learning and working memory capacity, potentially through altered levels of genes linked to synaptic plasticity and neuronal transmission. In contrast, inhibition of miR-9 or miR-34 led to a decreased capacity of spatial learning and of reference memory, respectively. On a molecular level, miR-9 inhibition resulted in altered expression of genes related to cell adhesion, endocytosis and cell death, while miR-34 inhibition caused transcriptome changes linked to neuroactive ligand-receptor transduction and cell communication. In summary, this study establishes distinct roles for individual miRNAs in hippocampal function. Three RNA samples containing bilateral entire hippocampi from three different mice, per group.

Immune-Responsive Gene 1 (Irg1) is a mitochondrial enzyme that produces itaconate under inflammatory conditions principally in cells of myeloid lineage. Cell culture studies suggest that itaconate regulates inflammation through inhibitory effects on cytokine and reactive oxygen species production. To evaluate the functions of Irg1 in vivo, we challenged wild-type (WT) and Irg1-/- mice with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and monitored disease progression. Irg1-/- but not WT mice succumbed rapidly to Mtb, and mortality was associated with increased infection, inflammation, and pathology. Infection of LysM-Cre Irg1fl/fl, MPR8-Cre Irg1fl/fl, and CD11c-Cre Irg1fl/fl conditional knockout mice along with neutrophil depletion experiments revealed a role for Irg1 in alveolar macrophages and LysM+ myeloid cells in preventing neutrophil-mediated immunopathology and disease. RNA-seq analyses suggest that Irg1 and its production of itaconate temper Mtb-induced inflammatory responses in myeloid cells at the transcriptional level. Thus, Irg1 modulates inflammation to curtail Mtb-induced lung disease.

This study focused on identifying the transcriptional and cell-signaling responses activated in A549 alveolar carcinoma cells incubated in the presence of A. fumigatus wild-type and DPrtT protease-deficient germinating conidia and culture filtrates (CF). Microarray analysis of exposed A549 cells identified distinct classes of genes whose expression is altered in the presence of germinating conidia and CF and suggested the involvement of both NFkB and MAPK signaling pathways in mediating the cellular response. Phosphoprotein analysis of A549 cells confirmed that JNK and ERK1/2 are phosphorylated in response to CF treatment in a protease-dependent manner.

The intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila causes an inflammatory pneumonia called Legionnaires' Disease. For virulence, L. pneumophila requires a Dot/Icm type IV secretion system that translocates bacterial effectors to the host cytosol. L. pneumophila lacking the Dot/Icm system is recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), leading to a canonical NF-kB-dependent transcriptional response. In addition, L. pneumophila expressing a functional Dot/Icm system potently induces unique transcriptional targets, including proinflammatory genes such as Il23a and Csf2. Here we demonstrate that this Dot/Icm-dependent response, which we term the effector-triggered response (ETR), requires five translocated bacterial effectors that inhibit host protein synthesis. Upon infection of macrophages with virulent L. pneumophila, these five effectors caused a global decrease in host translation, thereby preventing synthesis of IkB, an inhibitor of the NF-kB transcription factor. Thus, macrophages infected with wildtype L. pneumophila exhibited prolonged activation of NF-kB, which was associated with transcription of ETR target genes such as Il23a and Csf2. L. pneumophila mutants lacking the five effectors still activated TLRs and NF-kB, but because the mutants permitted normal IkB synthesis, NF-kB activation was more transient and was not sufficient to fully induce the ETR. L. pneumophila mutants expressing enzymatically inactive effectors were also unable to fully induce the ETR, whereas multiple compounds or bacterial toxins that inhibit host protein synthesis via distinct mechanisms recapitulated the ETR when administered with TLR ligands. Previous studies have demonstrated that the host response to bacterial infection is induced primarily by specific microbial molecules that activate TLRs or cytosolic pattern recognition receptors. Our results add to this model by providing a striking illustration of how the host immune response to a virulent pathogen can also be shaped by pathogen-encoded activities, such as inhibition of host protein synthesis. Three-condition experiment: macrophages left uninfected (negative control), or infected with wildtype Legionella pneumophila, or the mutant D5, which lacks five bacterial effectors involved in inhibition of host protein synthesis (lgt1, lgt2, lgt3, sidI, sidL) (two experimental conditions).

Cachexia is a devastating muscle wasting syndrome that occurs in patients suffering from chronic diseases, most commonly observed in 80% of advanced cancer patients. One of the primary causes of cachexia-associated morbidity and mortality is involuntary muscle wasting. And while many cachexia patients show hypermetabolism, its causative role in muscles had remained unclear. To understand the molecular basis of this muscle wasting, accurate models of cachexia are necessary. Using transcriptomics and cytokine profiling of human muscle stem cell-based models and human cancer-induced cachexia models in mice, we found that cachectic cancer cells secreted many inflammatory factors which rapidly led to higher levels of fatty acid metabolism and the activation of a p38 stress response signature, before the cachectic muscle wasting is manifested. Metabolomics profiling revealed that factors secreted by cachectic cancer cells rapidly induce excessive fatty acid oxidation in human myotubes, leading to oxidative stress, p38 activation, and impaired muscle growth. Pharmacological blockade of fatty acid oxidation not only rescued human myotubes, but also significantly improved muscle mass and total weight in cancer cachexia models in vivo. Therefore, fatty acid-induced oxidative stress could be targeted to prevent cancer cachexia. Three NOD-SCID mice were subcutaneously transplanted with RXF393 or SKRC39 cancer cells for 22 d.

Here, we demonstrate the role of lncRNA ceruloplasmin (NRCP) in cancer metabolism and elucidate functional effects leading to increased tumor progression. NRCP was highly upregulated in ovarian tumors and knockdown of NRCP resulted in significantly increased apoptosis, decreased cell proliferation, and decreased glycolysis compared with control cancer cells. In an orthotopic mouse model of ovarian cancer, siNRCP delivered via a liposomal carrier significantly reduced tumor growth compared with control treatment. We identified NRCP as an intermediate binding partner between STAT1 and RNA polymerase II, leading to increased expression of downstream target genes such as glucose-6-phosphate isomerase. Collectively, we report a previously unrecognized role of the lncRNA NRCP in modulating cancer metabolism. DOPC nanoparticle-incorporated siRNA-mediated silencing of this lncRNA in vivo demonstrates the first known preclinical model indicating therapeutic potential of modulating lncRNAs in cancer.

The ts-p53 E285K protein is a rare p53 mutant with temperature-sensitive (ts) loss of function characteristics. In cancer cells, which express ts-p53 E285K intriniscally, endogenous wild type p53 activity is reconstituted by appropriate cultivation temperature (permissive condition). At non-appropriate cultivation temperature (restrictive condition) this p53 mutant is inactive. The present study took advantage of this mechanism and employed IPH-926 lobular breast cancer cells and BT-474 ductal breast cancer cells, which both harbor endogenous ts-p53 E285K, for the transcriptional profiling of p53-responsive genes. This new approach eliminated the need for genetic modification or cytotoxic stimulation to achive a p53 response in the cells being investigated .

Background: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been implicated in metastasis, drug resistance, survival under stress and also conferring stem cell-like traits to cancer cells. However, several of the studies have been carried out using model systems that don't appropriately recapitulate all stages of the dynamic process of EMT. Hence, there is a need to overcome this limitation by development of a model system that allows us to mimic each stage of EMT and accurately assess the plastic changes associated with it. Methods: We have derived a cancer cell line from the PyMT-MMTV model of breast cancer, named PyMT-1099 cells, and undertaken a detailed characterization of the morpho-genetic changes it undergoes during a TGF-induced EMT. Further, we have also performed high throughput transcriptomics on PyMT-1099 cells undergoing EMT in a high resolution kinetic of TGF treatment. Results: We show that PyMT-1099 cells undergo an EMT comparable to the classically used immortalized NMuMG cells as assessed by morphological, and marker expression changes on TGFtreatment. Further, PyMT-1099 cells can also migrate in vitro in response to TGF treatment. These cells are also tumorigenic and lead to metastasis formation when transplanted into immunocompromised mice. Conclusion: In this study we report the development of PyMT-1099 cells as an excellent tool to model and study breast cancer-associated EMT both in vitro and in vivo and show that these cells overcome the limitations posed by other cellular systems currently being used to study EMT.

Infant B-acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL) that harbor MLL-AF4 rearrangements are associated with a poor prognosis. One important obstacle to progress for this patient population is the lack of models that faithfully recapitulate the short latency and aggressiveness of this disease. While current mouse models of Mll-Af4 can generate acute leukemia, not all are lymphoid, and the long latency to disease does not reflect what is seen in patients. Recent whole genome sequencing of MLL-AF4 B-ALL samples revealed a high frequency of mutations in proto-oncogenes involved in signaling pathways. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of activating mutant N-RasG12D cooperates with Mll-Af4 to generate a highly aggressive, serially transplantable B-ALL in mice. We used our novel mouse model to test the sensitivity of Mll-Af4/N-RasG12D leukemia to small molecule inhibitors, and found that dual targeting of the downstream effectors of Ras and the DNA damage response pathway through ATR inhibition induced long-term durable responses in both mouse and patient derived xenografts with both mutations in vivo. Our studies suggest that this mouse model of Mll-Af4/N-Ras B-ALL is not only a powerful tool to explore the molecular and genetic pathogenesis of this disease subtype, but also is an important preclinical discovery platform for novel therapeutics that might be used to treat patients with this disease.

Background Published multi-gene classifiers suggested outcome prediction for patients with stage UICC II colon cancer based on different gene expression signatures. However, there is currently no translation of these classifiers for application in routine diagnostic. Therefore, we aimed at validating own and published gene expression signatures employing methods which enable RNA and protein detection in routine diagnostic specimens. Results Immunohistochemistry was applied to 68 stage UICC II colon cancers to determine the protein expression of five selected previously published classifier genes (CDH17, LAT, CA2, EMR3, and TNFRSF11A). Correlation of protein expression data with clinical outcome within a 5-year post-surgery course failed to separate patients with a disease-free follow-up [Group DF] and relapse [Group R]). In addition, RNA from macrodissected tumor samples from 53 of these 68 patients was profiled on Affymetrix GeneChips (HG-U133 Plus 2.0). Prognostic signatures were generated by Nearest Shrunken Centroids with cross-validation. Although gene expression profiling allowed the identification of differentially expressed genes between the groups DF and R, a stable classification and prognosis signature was not discernable in our data. Furthermore, the application of previously published gene signatures consisting of 22 and 19 genes, respectively, to our gene expression data set using 'global tests' and leave-one-out cross-validation was unable to predict clinical outcome (prediction rate 75.5% and 64.2%; n.s.). T-stage was the only independent prognostic factor for relapse in multivariate analysis with established clinical and pathological parameters including microsatellite status. Conclusions Our protein and gene expression analyses currently do not support application of molecular classifiers for prediction of clinical outcome in routine diagnostic as a basis for patient-orientated therapy in stage UICC II colon cancer. Further studies are needed to develop prognosis signatures applicable in patient care. 53 patients with primary stage UICC II colon cancer treated by elective standard oncological resection were selected. None of the patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with susceptibility for hereditary colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease were excluded from this study.

During neocortical development, neurons undergo polarization, oriented migration, and layer type-specific differentiation. The transcriptional programs underlying these processes are not completely understood. Here we show that the transcription factor Bcl11a regulates polarity and migration of upper layer neurons. Bcl11a-deficient late-born neurons fail to correctly switch from multipolar to bipolar morphology resulting in impaired radial migration. We show that the expression of Sema3c is increased in migrating Bcl11a-deficient neurons and that Bcl11a is a direct negative regulator of Sema3c transcription. In vivo gain-of-function and rescue experiments demonstrate that Sema3c is a major downstream effector of Bcl11a required for the cell polarity switch and for the migration of upper layer neurons. Our data uncover a novel Bcl11a/Sema3c-dependent regulatory pathway used by migrating cortical neurons. Neocortex tissue from three control (Bcl11a+/+) and three Bcl11a mutants (Bcl11aDflox/Dflox) embryos was collected at E14.5.

Mammalian cells are commonly employed to identify active compounds that could affect progression of many human diseases including retinitis pigmentosa. Here, using transcriptome analysis to compare NIH3T3 cells expressing rod opsin with the disease-causing a single point P23H mutation, we differentiated between genes affected by heterologous opsin expression and those influenced by the P23H opsin mutant gain- or loss-of-function. Surprisingly, heterologous expression of normal opsin causes changes in 783 out of 16888 protein coding transcripts more than 1 fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) in NIH3T3 cells despite that opsin is exogenous to this cell. The perturbed genes are involved in cell adhesion, morphology and migration and encode extracellular matrix proteins, growth factors, cytoskeleton proteins, glycoproteins or metalloproteases. Not fully overlapping 347 differentially expressed genes were affected when the P23H mutant opsin was expressed. Transcriptome perturbation by individual drug candidates also revealed that different active compounds can target distinct molecular pathways that result in a similar phenotype selected by a cell-based high throughput screen. This transcriptome approach is capable of detecting minute changes in the transcriptome and can be a key to therapeutic success of a candidate drug to restore the normal gene expression landscape in affected tissue.

Development of spider veins is caused by the remodeling of veins located in the upper dermis and promoted by risk factors such as obesity or pregnancy that chronically increase venous pressure. We have repeatedly shown that the pressure-induced increase in biomechanical wall stress is sufficient to evoke the formation of enlarged corkscrew-like superficial veins in mice. Subsequent experimental approaches revealed that interference with endothelial- and/or smooth muscle cell activation counteracts this remodeling process. Here, we investigate whether the herbal agent glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is a suitable candidate for that purpose given its anti-proliferative as well as anti-oxidative properties.While basic abilities of cultured venous smooth muscle cells (SMCs) such as migration and proliferation were not influenced by GA, it inhibited proliferation but not angiogenic sprouting of human venous endothelial cells (ECs). Further analyses of biomechanically stimulated ECs revealed that GA inhibits the DNA binding capacity of the mechanosensitive transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1) which, however, had only a minor impact on the endothelial transcriptome. Nevertheless, by decreasing gelatinase activity in ECs or mouse veins exposed to biomechanical stress, GA diminished a crucial cellular response in the context of venous remodeling. In line with the observed inhibitory effects, local transdermal application of GA attenuated pressure-mediated enlargement of veins in the mouse auricle. In summary, our data identifies GA as an inhibitor of EC proliferation, gelatinase activity and venous remodeling. It may thus have the capacity to attenuate spider vein formation and remodeling in humans. Comparison of biomechanically stretched HUVEC treated with DMSO or Glycyrrhetinic acid.",

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) are the major primary liver cancers in adults. It has been shown the phenotypic overlap between HCC and CC, comprising continuous liver cancer spectrum. As a proof of concept, a recent study has demonstrated a genomic subtype of HCC expressing CC-like gene expression trait, i.e. CC-like HCC, which has revealed common genomic trait of stem cell-like property and aggressive clinical outcome. However, the histopathological characteristics of these intermediate phenotype was not fully evaluated yet. Here, we found that a variant HCC with fibrous stromal component, i.e. scirrhous HCC, has CC-like genomic features. By performing gene expression profiling and immunohistochemical evaluation, we compared the morphological and molecular features of scirrhous HCC with CC and classical HCC. We found that the scirrhous HCC express both CC-like and stem cell-like expression traits. In addition, we observed the expression of core epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes, which may contribute to the aggressive behavior of scirrhous HCC. Over-expression of transforming growth factor b (TGF-b) signaling was also found, implying its regulatory role in the pathobiology of scirrhous HCC. Conclusion: We suggest that the fibrous stromal component in HCC may contribute to the acquisition of CC-like gene expression trait in HCC. The expression of stem cell-like trait and TGF-b/EMT molecules may play pivotal roles in the aggressive phenotype of scirrhous HCC.

To comprehensively delineate the involvement of CD40 (TNFRSF5) in EC activation, we combined RNAi-mediated CD40 knock-down with comparative genome-wide transcriptional profiling of EC in response to T cell. We report the initiation of a profound stress response in ECs upon CD40-CD40L engagement through early up-regulation, among others, of the major pro-inflammatory NFkB and MAPK/SAPK pathways and their associated transcription factors. Moreover, we have identified novel genes regulated through the CD40-CD40L interaction, and pathways previously unrecognized to be induced by CD40 signaling in ECs. Thus, we document a strong down-regulation of endothelial APLN by CD40-CD40L interaction, which could lead to vascular tone dysfunction in atherosclerotic lesions. Conversely, CD40-mediated up-regulation of the viral immune surveillance system, notably TLR3, IFIH1, RIG-I, and RNASEL, establishes a reverse link from adaptive to innate immunity in ECs. Moreover, systematic enrichment analysis substantiates endothelial CD40 involvement in the transcriptional regulation of gene networks associated with adhesion and motility, immunity, cell fate control, hemostasis and metabolism. Our study also highlights the potency and specificity of CD40 siRNA mediated inhibition, and the relevance of CD40 signaling pathways for anti-inflammatory therapeutic intervention.Keywords: treated vs. untreated comparison, time course. Time course experiment comparing endothelial gene expression profiling of CD40-silenced versus non-silenced cultured cells using RNA interference. Two independent experiments were performed where HUVECs were siRNA-transfected and co-cultured with Jurkat D1.1 for 4, 10, 16 h and harvested for RNA extraction. Technical dye swap duplicates were performed for each of the two biological replicates in all three time points.",

Background: Niemann-Pick type C is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder presenting aggravating neurologic symptoms due degeneration of specific types of CNS neurons. At present, it is not well understood how neurons react to NPC1 deficiency and why some neuronal cell types are more vulnerable than others.Purpose: We took aimed to uncover how a specific type of CNS neuron that can be highly purified reacts to NPC1 deficiency based on changes in gene expression.Methods: Retinal ganglion cells were purified from individual one-week old Balb/c mice homozygous for a mutant NPC1 allele (NPC1m1N) and wildtype littermates (n = 4 mice each genotype) using immunopanning. Total RNA was isolated from acutely isolated neurons and subjected to RNAseq using 4 biological replicates for each genotype.Results: Our analysis revealed a strong downregulation of transcripts known to be decreased in mutant mice including Npc1 and Calb1 thus validating our approach. We observed a strong upregulation of genes for cellular cholesterol accretion and the downregulation of those for cholesterol release. Other changes including downregulation genes involved in the immune response and synaptic components.Conclusions: The observed changes suggest that neurons already at one week of age sense a cholesterol deficit because lipids accumulate in the endosomal-lysosomal system and cannot be redistributed intracellularly.

Due to heterogeneous multifocal nature of prostate cancer (PCa), there is currently a lack of biomarkers that stably distinguish it from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), predict clinical outcome and guide the choice of optimal treatment. In this study, RNA-seq analysis was applied to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor and matched normal tissue samples collected from Russian patients with PCa and BPH. We identified 3384 genes differentially expressed (DE) (FDR < 0.05) between tumor tissue of PCa patients and adjacent normal tissue as well as both tissue types from BPH patients. Overexpression of four of the genes previously not associated with PCa (ANKRD34B, NEK5, KCNG3, and PTPRT) was validated by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, the enrichment analysis of overrepresented microRNA and transcription factor (TF) recognition sites within DE genes revealed common regulatory elements of which 13 microRNAs and 53 TFs were thus linked to PCa for the first time. Moreover, 8 of these TFs (FOXJ2, GATA6, NFE2L1, NFIL3, PRRX2, TEF, EBF2 and ZBTB18) were found to be differentially expressed in this study, making them not only candidate biomarkers of prostate cancer but also potential therapeutic targets.

We mapped the global DNA methylation patterns in selected prostate tissues and cell lines using Methylplex-Next Generation Sequencing (M-NGS). Hidden Markov Model based next generation sequence analysis identified ~68,000 methylated regions per sample. While global CpG Island (CGI) methylation was not differential between benign adjacent and cancer samples, overall promoter CGI methylation increased from ~12.6% in benign samples to 19.3% and 21.8% in localized and metastatic cancer tissues, respectively. We found distinct patterns of promoter methylation around transcription start sites, where methylation occurred not only on the CGIs, but also on flanking regions and CGI sparse promoters. Among the 6,691 methylated promoters in prostate tissues, 2481 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are cancer specific, including numerous novel DMRs. A novel cancer specific DMR in WFDC2 promoter showed heavy methylation in cancer (17/22 tissues, 6/6 cell lines), but not in the benign tissues (0/10) and normal PrEC cells. Integration of LNCaP DNA methylation and H3K4me3 data suggested an epigenetic mechanism for alternate transcription start site utilization and these modifications segregated into distinct regions when present on the same promoter. Finally, we observed differences in repeat element methylation, particularly LINE-1, between ERG gene fusion positive and negative cancers.

Here, we introduce these substitutions into the endogenous Foxp2 gene.of mice. Although these mice are generally healthy, they have qualitatively different ultrasonic vocalizations, decreased exploratory behavior and decreased dopamine concentrations in the brain suggesting an effect of the humanized Foxp2 allele on basal ganglia. In the striatum, a part of the basal ganglia that is affected in humans with a speech deficit due to one non-functional FOXP2 allele, we find that medium spiny neurons have increased dendrite lengths and increased synaptic plasticity. Since mice carrying one non-functional Foxp2 allele show opposite effects, this suggests that alterations in cortico-basal ganglia circuits might have been important for the evolution of speech and language in humans. In this particular experiment, we investigate the effects of human Foxp2 (Foxp2hum) and the non-functional Foxp2 allele on striatal gene expression in embryonic, young and adult mice.

To identify potential receptors for sFNDC4 we screened a population of immortalized stromovascular mouse cells derived from inguinal white fat for cells, which showed high (high binding cells-HBC) or low binding (low binding cells-LBC) to recombinant FcsFNDC4.We utilised microarray to identify differentially expressed genes between HBC and LBC.

Experimental validations of these results and further experimental sutdies supported that GPR116 is the receptor for sFNDC4.

The zebrafish has proven to be a versatile and valuable model for investigating the molecular and cellular basis of Fragile X syndrome (FXS). Reduction of expression of the zebrafish FMR1-ortholgous gene, fmr1, causes developmental and behavioural phenotypes related to the human syndrome. The hu2787 nonsense mutation allele of fmr1 is now the most widely used zebrafish model of FXS, although the FXS-relevant phenotypes seen from morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (morpholino) suppression of fmr1 transcript translation were not observed when this allele was first described. The subsequent discovery of genetic compensation, whereby morpholino-directed knockdown can give a more \"pure\" loss-of-function phenotype while mutations causing nonsense mediated decay of transcripts cause compensatory upregulation of homologous transcripts, suggested an explanation for the differences observed. To test for molecular evidence of genetic compensation in fmr1hu2787 homozygous mutants, we compared the transcriptomes of homozygous mutant and wild type larvae at 2 days post fertilisation. We observed statistically significant changes in the expression of a number of gene transcripts, but none with sequence homology to fmr1. Curiously, the majority of differentially expressed genes are located, like fmr1, on chromosome 14. Quantitative PCR tests on genomic DNA did not support that the apparent expression differences were artefacts due to changes in relative chromosome abundance. The coordinate dysregulation of chromosome 14 genes due to mutation of fmr1 supports this gene's involvement in a chromosome-wide gene regulation complex. Four clutches of zebrafish embryos were obtained from pair-matings of zebrafish homozygous for the hu2787 allele of fmr1. Another four clutches of zebrafish embryos were obtained from wild-type zebrafish. Each clutch was derived from a different pair of parents.",

Here, we report the identification and characterization of a novel heterochromatinization factor in vertebrates, Bromo Adjacent Homology Domain-containing protein 1 (BAHD1). BAHD1 interacts with HP1, MBD1, HDAC5 and with several transcription factors. Through electron and immunofluorescence microscopy studies, we show that BAHD1 overexpression directs HP1 to specific nuclear sites and promotes formation of large heterochromatic domains, which lack acetyl histone H3 and are enriched in H3 trimethylated at lysine 27. Furthermore, ectopically expressed BAHD1 colocalizes with the heterochromatic X inactive chromosome. As highlighted by whole genome microarray analysis of BAHD1 knock down cells, BAHD1 represses several proliferation and survival genes and in particular, the insulin-like growth factor II gene (IGF2). BAHD1 specifically binds the CpG-rich P3 promoter of IGF2. This region contains DNA binding sequences for the transcription factor SP1, with which BAHD1 co-immunoprecipitates. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that BAHD1 acts as a silencer by recruiting proteins that coordinate heterochromatin assembly at specific sites in the genome.We used microarrays to identify BAHD1 gene targets.

Mis-expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle, however, is toxic and causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). We recently showed DUX4-induced toxicity is due, in part, to the accumulation of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) with concomitant activation of the PKR viral response pathway. Here, using dsRNA immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing, we determined that DUX4-induced dsRNAs originate from intergenic regions enriched for Alu and LINE-1 elements, endogenous retroviruses, and pericentric human satellite II (HSATII) repeats. DUX4-induced HSATII dsRNAs are formed via temporally controlled bidirectional expression with predominant transcription of one strand preceding the other. Whereas DUX4 activation of dsRNAs derived from intergenic regions such as HSATII contributes to toxicity in FSHD, in the early embryo these dsRNAs might facilitate heterochromatin formation, as has been proposed for cleavage stage expression of mouse major satellites. Double-stranded RNA immunoprecipitations were conducted on MB135-DUX4i cells using K1 or J2 mouse monoclonal antibodies with three replicates per each -/+doxycycline condition which induces DUX4 expression. Mouse nonspecific IgG was used as comparator for analysis.",

    "text": "COX-2 mediates tumor-stromal Prolactin signaling to initiate tumorigenesis [cell lines]. Tumor-stromal communication within the microenvironment contributes to initiation of metastasis and may present a therapeutic opportunity. Using serial single cell RNA-sequencing in an orthotopic mouse prostate cancer model, we find upregulation of Prolactin receptor as cancer cells that have disseminated to the lung expand into micrometastases. Secretion of the ligand Prolactin by adjacent lung stromal cells is induced by tumor cell production of the COX-2 synthetic product prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2). PGE-2 treatment of fibroblasts activates the nuclear orphan receptor NR4A (Nur77), with Prolactin as a major transcriptional target for the NR4A-Retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer. Ectopic expression of Prolactin receptor in mouse cancer cells enhances micrometastasis, while treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor Celecoxib abrogates Prolactin secretion by fibroblasts and reduces tumor initiation. Across multiple human cancers, COX-2, Prolactin, and Prolactin receptor show consistent differential expression in tumor and stromal compartments. Such paracrine crosstalk may thus contribute to the documented efficacy of COX-2 inhibitors in cancer suppression. Five subclonal cell lines were established from CE1-4 prostate cancer cells, derived from tissue-specific inactivation of PTEN [Pubmed ID: 20631921].

    "text": "Nutritional effects by beta-carotene in lung in males and females of control mice versus BCMO knockout mice. Molecular mechanisms triggered by high dietary beta-carotene (BC) intake in lung are largely unknown. We performed microarray gene expression analysis on lung tissue of BC supplemented beta-carotene 15,150-monooxygenase 1 knockout (Bcmo1-/-) mice, which are--like humans--able to accumulate BC. Our main observation was that the genes were regulated in an opposite direction in male and female Bcmo1-/- mice by BC. The steroid biosynthetic pathway was overrepresented in BC-supplemented male Bcmo1-/- mice. Testosterone levels were higher after BC supplementation only in Bcmo1-/- mice, which had, unlike wild-type (Bcmo1+/+) mice, large variations. We hypothesize that BC possibly affects hormone synthesis or metabolism. Since sex hormones influence lung cancer risk, these data might contribute to an explanation for the previously found increased lung cancer risk after BC supplementation (ATBC and CARET studies). Moreover, effects of BC may depend on the presence of frequent human BCMO1 polymorphisms, since these effects were not found in wild-type mice. The experimental setup has been described previously for females and males (Van Helden et al., CMLS 2010 and Carcinogenesis, 2011, resp.). Twelve female (fe) and 12 male (ma) B6129SF1 (Bcmo1+/+) and 12 female and 12 male B6;129S-Bcmo1tm1dnp (Bcmo1-/-) mice were used for the dietary intervention, which was conducted in accordance with the German animal protection laws by the guidelines of the local veterinary authorities. During the breeding and weaning periods of the mice, mothers were maintained on KLIBA 3430 chow containing 14,000 IU vitamin A/kg diet (Provima Kliba AG, Kaiseraugst, Switzerland). Five-week-old female and male Bcmo1+/+ and Bcmo1-/- mice were caged in groups containing two to four siblings per group and were maintained under environmentally controlled conditions (temperature 24 C, 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle). Mice had ad libitum access to feed and water. Basic feed consisted of the pelletized diet D12450B (Research Diets Inc, USA) with a fat content of 10%. The diet was modified to contain 1,500 IU vitamin A/kg of diet, which is a vitamin A-sufficient diet, and the control diet (control) was supplemented with water-soluble vehicle beadlets (DSM Nutritional Products Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) containing DL-alpha-tocopherol and ascorbyl palmitate as stabilizers, as well as carriers such as gelatin, corn oil, sucrose and starch. The BC diet (BC) was supplemented with identical water-soluble beadlets containing BC (DSM Nutritional Products Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) to generate 150 mg BC/kg diet. Beadlets were added by the manufacturer before low temperature pelletting. Feed pellets were color marked and stored at 4 C in the dark. After 14 weeks of dietary intervention, mice were killed after isoflurane and ketamin anesthesia and blood and lung tissue isolated. Lungs were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and subsequently stored at -80 C.

MondoA (also known as MLXIP), a member of the MYC interactome, has been described as an example of a metabolic sensor. By assessing patient data sets we found that MondoA overexpression is associated with a worse survival in pediatric common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Using CRISPR/Cas9 and RNA interference approaches, we observed that MondoA depletion reduces transformational capacity of B-ALL cells in vitro and dramatically inhibits malignant potential in an in vivo mouse model. Interestingly, reduced expression of MondoA in patient data sets correlated with enrichment in metabolic pathways. The loss of MondoA correlated with increased tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity. Mechanistically, MondoA senses metabolic stress in B-ALL cells by restricting oxidative phosphorylation through reduced PDH activity. Glutamine starvation conditions greatly enhance this effect and highlight the inability to mitigate metabolic stress upon loss of MondoA in B-ALL. CHIPseq revealed a modest but highly significant redistribution of MYC towards binding sites shared with MondoA upon loss of MondoA.

The reassorted human 2009 pandemic H1N1 (H1N1pdm) virus infected millions of people and caused thousands of deaths with associated immunopathology. Traditional immunosuppressants have limited capabilities in controlling inflammatory responses associated with severe influenza infections. A new therapeutic strategy, therefore, must be developed. We evaluated several adjuvants including toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, TLR independent adjuvants and Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) for limiting severe H1N1pdm infection outcomes in a mouse model. In contrast to the TLR agonists and TLR independent adjuvants, CFA which contains multiple pattern recognition receptor (PRR) agonists significantly restrained pro-inflammatory responses and promoted survival in mice from lethal H1N1pdm infection. CFA reduced expression of the plamacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) markers and interferon alpha (IFN-a) after infection, whereas it elevated the T regulatory (Treg) cell suppressive molecules galectin-1 and CTLA-4 expression. Consequently, Th1 cell differentiation and CD8+ effector T cell responses were diminished via downregulated myeloid DC (mDC) costimulation. Furthermore, CTLA-4 expressing Treg cells were dramatically increased when the CFA primed splenocytes were restimulated with its stimuli-killed mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. TB). The elevated CTLA-4 on Treg cells led to reduced CD86 expressing pDCs/mDCs and less CD4+ effector T cells. Overall, our study highlights that the stimuli of innate immunity potentially controls overactive host immune responses in certain situations, and the uncovered mechanism(s) sheds light on the development of anti-influenza therapies.

In particular, elevated levels of the kynurenine metabolites 3-hydroxy kynurenine (3-OH-Kyn) and quinolinic acid (Quin), have been reported in the brains of HD patients as well as in rodent models of HD. The production of these metabolites is controlled by the activity of kynurenine mono-oxygenase (KMO), a mitochondrial outer membrane enzyme which catalyzes the synthesis of 3-OH-Kyn from Kyn. Thus inhibiting KMO is expected to produce a beneficial effect in Huntington's Disease (HD) patients, hopefully reversing their phenotype to match healthy subjects. To test this effect, we acutely treated a mouse model of HD (R6/2, a transgenic mouse model of HD which contains a human HTT gene containing 90 CAG repeats) and wild type mice with a KMO inhibitor, and separately used a mock treatment on both the transgenic mice and wild type mice.

    "text": "Activation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex dictates tumour progression in prostate cancer. Metabolism in cancer serves to provide energy and key biomolecules that sustain cell growth, a process that is frequently accompanied by decreased mitochondrial use of glucose. Importantly, metabolic intermediates including mitochondrial metabolites are central substrates for post-translational modifications at the core of cellular signalling and epigenetics. However, the molecular means that coordinate the use of mitochondrial metabolites for anabolism and nuclear protein modification are poorly understood. Here, we unexpectedly found that genetic and pharmacological inactivation of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase A1 (PDHA1), a subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) that regulates mitochondrial metabolism16 inhibits prostate cancer development in different mouse and human xenograft tumour models. Intriguingly, we found that lipid biosynthesis was strongly affected in prostate tumours upon PDC inactivation. Mechanistically, we found that nuclear PDC controls the expression of Sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor (SREBF) target genes by mediating histone acetylation whereas mitochondrial PDC provides cytosolic citrate for lipid synthesis in a coordinated effort to sustain anabolism. In line with the oncogenic function of PDC in prostate cancer, we find that PDHA1 and the PDC activator, Pyruvate dehydrogenase phospatase 1 (PDP1), are frequently amplified and overexpressed at both gene and protein level in these tumours. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that both mitochondrial and nuclear PDC sustains prostate tumourigenesis by controlling lipid biosynthesis thereby pointing at this complex as a novel target for cancer therapy. We evaluated that the PDHA1 knockdown in a series of human prostate cancer cell lines relying on elevates PDC activity induced growth arrestGEP analysis of mice Pdha1*pc-/pc-, mice Pten*pc-/pc- *Pdha1*pc-/pc- and mice Pten*pc-/pc- CTRL.",

Derivatives of RN2 AML cells were prepared that encode doxycycline-inducible expression of either of two different shRNAs targeting Ddx5 (shDdx5.1322 and shDdx5.2086) or a negative control shRNA that targets Renilla Luciferase (shRen.713).Six independent cultures of each derivative RN2 cell line (shDdx5.1322, shDdx5.2086, or shRen.713) were treated with doxycycline at timepoint 0 days to induce expression of the indicated shRNA in the RN2 cells. Each shRNA is co-expressed with dsRed in a doxycycline-induced manner and flow cytometry analysis indicated that doxycycline induced expression of dsRed and the shRNA in 70-to-80% of the cells in each culture.

Previous evidence indicates that strong overexpression of FBP in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) supports tumor growth and correlates with poor patient prognosis. However, the role of the transcriptional repressor FIR in hepatocarcinogenesis remains poorly delineated. We show that overexpression of FIR correlates with tumor dedifferentiation and tumor cell proliferation in about 60% of primary HCCs. Elevated FIR levels are associated with genomic gains of the fir gene locus at chromosome 8q24.3 in human HCC specimens. In vitro, nuclear enrichment of FIR supports HCC cell proliferation and migration. Expression profiling of HCC cells after siRNA-mediated silencing of FIR identified the transcription factor DP-1 (TFDP1) as a transcriptional target of FIR. Surprisingly, FIR stimulates the expression of FBP in a TFDP1/E2F-dependent manner. FIR splice variants lacking or containing exon 2 and/or exon 5 are expressed in the majority of HCCs. Specific inhibition of FIR isoforms with and without exon 2 revealed that all FIR splice variants facilitate tumor-supporting effects. This finding was confirmed in xenograft transplantation experiments with lentiviral-infected shRNA targeting all FIR variants as well as FIR with and without exon 2. In summary, high-level nuclear FIR does not facilitate repressor properties but supports tumor growth in HCC cells. Thus, the pharmacological inhibition of FIR might represent a promising therapeutic strategy for HCC patients.

Identification of host responses at the gene transcription level provides a molecular profile of the events that occur following infection. Brucella abortus is a facultative intracellular pathogen of macrophages that induces chronic infection in humans and domestic animals. Using microarray technology, the response of macrophages 4 hours following B. abortus infection was analyzed to identify early intracellular infection events that occur in macrophages. Of the more than 6,000 genes, we identified over 140 genes that were reproducibly differentially transcribed. First, an increase in the transcription of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-1a, and members of the SCY family of proteins, was evident that may constitute a general host recruitment of antibacterial defenses. Alternatively, Brucella may subvert newly arriving macrophages for additional intracellular infection. Second, transcription of receptors and cytokines associated with antigen presentation, e.g., MHC class II and IL-12p40, were not evident at this 4 hour period of infection. Third, Brucella inhibited transcription of various host genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycling, and intracellular vesicular trafficking. Identification of macrophage genes whose transcription was inhibited suggests that Brucella utilizes specific mechanisms to target certain cell pathways. In conclusion, these data suggest that B. abortus can alter macrophage pathways to recruit additional macrophages for future infection while simultaneously inhibiting apoptosis and innate immune mechanisms within the macrophage permitting intracellular survival of the bacterium. These results provide insights into the pathogenic strategies used by Brucella to survive long-term within a hostile environment.Keywords: Macrophage, intracellular pathogen, Brucella abortus, inflammatory immune response.

The loss of E-cadherin causes dysfunction of the cell-cell junction machinery, which is an initial step in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), facilitating cancer cell invasion and the formation of metastases. A set of transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin (CDH1) gene expression, including Snail1, Snail2 and Zeb2 mediate E-cadherin down-regulation in breast cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the control of E-cadherin expression in breast cancer progression remain largely unknown. Here, by using global gene expression approaches, we uncover a novel function for Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein (CdGAP) in the regulation of expression of genes involved in EMT. We found that CdGAP used its proline-rich domain to form a functional complex with Zeb2 to mediate the repression of E-cadherin expression in ErbB2-transformed breast cancer cells. Conversely, knockdown of CdGAP expression led to a decrease of the transcriptional repressors Snail1 and Zeb2, and this correlated with an increase in E-cadherin levels, restoration of cell-cell junctions, and epithelial-like morphological changes. In vivo, loss of CdGAP in ErbB2-transformed breast cancer cells impaired tumor growth and suppressed metastasis to lungs. Finally, CdGAP was highly expressed in basal-type breast cancer cells, and its strong expression correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Together, these data support a previously unknown nuclear function for CdGAP where it cooperates in a GAP-independent manner with transcriptional repressors to function as a critical modulator of breast cancer through repression of E-cadherin transcription. Targeting Zeb2-CdGAP interactions may represent novel therapeutic opportunities for breast cancer treatment. Total RNA profiles of ErbB2-expressing control mammary tumor explants cells (shCON) and CdGAP-depleted cells (shCdGAP) were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSEq2000.",

Following diet initiation, there was sequential development of steatosis (4-8 weeks), steatohepatitis with ballooning and Mallory-Denk bodies (12-16 weeks), progressive fibrosis (16 week onwards) and spontaneous HCC (32-52 weeks). The mice developed obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. There was concordance with the human NASH transcriptome (FDR 0.001) with activation of lipogenic, inflammatory and apoptotic pathways relevant in humans. The HCC gene signature resembled S1 and S2 human HCC subclass (FDR 0.01 for both). This simple model of NASH and HCC that resembles human disease in terms of its triggers, physiological and biochemical parameters, histology, transcriptomic profile, and outcomes can facilitate preclinical development for these conditions. 129S1/SvImJ;C57Bl/6J (129/B6) mice were fed with high-fat diet (Western Diet) and high fructose-glucose solution (Sugar Water) (WD SW) or chow diet (CD) for 8 weeks, and total RNA samples were isolated from liver tissues for genome-wide expression profiling.",

TRAF3IP2 is a candidate psoriasis susceptibility gene encoding Act1, a ubiquitin ligase that couples the IL-17 receptor to downstream signaling pathways. We investigated the role of Act1 in keratinocyte responses to IL-17 using a tetracycline inducible shRNA targeting TRAF3IP2. Tet exposure for seven days effectively silenced TRAF3IP2 mRNA and Act1 protein, resulting in 761 genes with significant changes in expression (495 down, 266 up, >1.5-fold, p<0.05). Gene Ontology analysis revealed that genes affected by TRAF3IP2 silencing are involved in epidermal differentiation, with early differentiation genes (KRT1, KRT10, DSC1, DSG1) being downregulated and late differentiation genes (SPRR2, SPRR3, LCE3) being upregulated. AP1 binding sites were enriched upstream of genes up-regulated by TRAF3IP2 silencing. Correspondingly, nuclear expression of FosB and Fra1 was increased in TRAF3IP2-silenced cells. Many genes involved in host defense were induced by IL-17 in a TRAF3IP2-dependent fashion. Inflammatory differentiation conditions (serum addition for 4 days postconfluence) markedly amplified these IL-17 responses, while increasing basal levels and TRAF3IP2 silencing-dependent upregulation of late differentiation genes. These findings suggest that TRAF3IP2 may alter both epidermal homeostasis and keratinocyte defense responses to influence psoriasis risk. Immortalized N/TERT-2G keratinocytes were either untreated or treated with tetracycline (TET) for TRAF3IP2 knockdown. Additionally, cells were either untreated or treated with IL17, TNF, or IL17+TNF.

Tumor cell-intrinsic reprogramming attenuated MAPK-dependency, while enhancing mesenchymal, angiogenic and IFN-inflammatory features and growth/survival dependence on multi-RTKs and PD-L2. In the immune compartment, PD-L2 upregulation in CD11c+ immunocytes drove the loss of T-cell inflammation and promoted BRAFi resistance. Thus, residual melanoma early on MAPKi therapy already displays potentially exploitable adaptive transcriptomic, epigenomic, immune-regulomic alterations.

Objectives: Earlier studies involving a priori gene selection have identified promoter regions deregulated by DNA methylation changes in oral squamous cell cancers (OSCCs) and precancers. Interrogation of global DNA methylation patterns for such specimens has not been reported, though such analyses are needed to uncover novel molecular factors driving disease. Materials and Methods: We evaluated global DNA methylation patterns for 30 biopsies obtained from 10 patients undergoing surgical removal of an OSCC or carcinoma in situ (CIS). From a disease field in each patient, we collected i) dysplastic, ii) CIS or OSCC, and iii) adjacent normal biopsies. DNA isolated from each biopsy was profiled for methylation status using the Illumina HumanMethylation27K platform. Results: Our data demonstrate that aberrant methylation of promoter CpG islands exists across oral precancer and OSCC genomes. Non-hierarchical clustering of all methylation data revealed distinct methylation patterns between the normal and the CIS/OSCC tissues (with results for dysplastic biopsies split between groups). Multiple genes exhibiting recurrent aberrant DNA methylation were found for both dysplastic and CIS/OSCC groups, and included enrichment for genes found in the WNT and MAPK signaling pathways. Conclusion: In identifying aberrant DNA methylation at the earliest stages of oral precancer and finding recurring epigenetic disruption of specific genes/pathways across our analyzed cohort, we conclude that CpG methylation changes are a hallmark of oral cancer progression and that global DNA methylation analyses are an essential component for wider studies seeking to derive biomarkers or potentially druggable targets for improving oral cancer outcomes.

Early postmigratory neural crest subpopulations contributing to distinct mouse craniofacial structures displayed similar chromatin accessibility patterns, yet differed transcriptionally. Accessible promoters and enhancers of differentially silenced genes carried H3K27me3/H3K4me2 bivalent chromatin marks embedded in large Ezh2-dependent Polycomb domains, indicating transcriptional poising.

EWS-FLI1 is a chimeric ETS transcription factor that is, due to a chromosomal rearrangement, specifically expressed in Ewing's sarcoma family tumors (ESFT) and is thought to be the initiating event in the development of the disease. Previous genomic profiling experiments have identified a number of EWS-FLI1 regulated genes and genes that discriminate ESFT from other sarcomas, but so far a comprehensive analysis of EWS-FLI1 dependent molecular functions characterizing this aggressive cancer is lacking. In this study a molecular function map of ESFT was constructed based on an integrative analysis of gene expression profiling experiments on a uniform microarray platform following EWS-FLI1 knockdown in a panel of five ESFT cell lines, and on gene expression data from the same platform of 59 primary ESFT tumors. Based on the assumption that EWS-FLI1 is the driving transcriptional force in ESFT pathogenesis, we predicted an inverse correlation of gene expression for EWS-FLI1 regulated genes between the putative tissue of origin and the cell lines under EWS-FLI1 knockdown conditions. Consistent with recent reports, mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPC) were found to fit this hypothesis best and were therefore used as the reference tissue for the construction of the molecular function map in ESFT.The interrelations of molecular pathways were visualized by measuring the similarity among annotated gene functions by gene sharing. The molecular function map highlighted distinct clusters of activities for EWS-FLI1 regulated genes in ESFT and revealed a striking difference between EWS-FLI1 up- and down-regulated genes: EWS-FLI1 induced genes mainly belong to cell cycle regulation, proliferation and response to DNA damage, while repressed genes were associated with differentiation and cell communication.This study revealed that EWS-FLI1 combines by distinct molecular mechanisms two important functions of cellular transformation in one protein, growth promotion and differentiation blockage. By taking MPC as a reference tissue a significant EWS-FLI1 signature was discovered in ESFT that only partially overlapped with previously published EWS-FLI1 dependent gene expression patterns, identifying a series of novel targets for the chimeric protein in ESFT. Our results may guide target selection for future ESFT specific therapies.Keywords: Ewing's Sarcoma, EWS-FLI1, RNAi knock down and controls. EWS-FLI1 knock down was performed by expressing specific siRNAs against EWS-FLI1 as small hairpin (sh) RNAs from pSUPER-based retroviral expression constructs in 5 different Ewing's sarcoma cell lines (WE68, SK-N-MC, TC252, STA-ET-1, STA-ET-7.2).

However, the role of these upregulated circRNAs remain to be clarified. In this study, we analyzed circRNA high-throughout sequencing from human tissues and focused on the upregulated circRNAs and identified a novel circular RNA, hsa_circ_0001361 (also named bladder cancer upregulated circRNA-1, BCUC-1), as a new candidate circRNA derived from FNDC3B gene.

Mammary carcinomas were induced in female obese and lean rats by irradiation with 4 Gy of gamma rays. Gene expression of mammary carcinomas and normal mammary tissues were analyzed with Agilent Whole Rat Genome DNA microarray. The result indicated that genes related to translation and oxidative phosphorylation were upregulated in carcinomas of obese rats. Female Sprague-Dawley (Jcl:SD) rats fed on a high fat diet (45 kcal% fat) were divided into obesity prone (OP, n = 30) and resistant (OR, n = 30) individuals based on the body weight at 7 weeks of age, when they were whole-body irradiated with 4 Gy of Cs-137 gamma rays at 0.5 Gy/min; lean control (LC, n = 30) rats were fed on a standard diet (10 kcal% fat) and irradiated in the same manner; these groups of rats were observed for development of palpable mammary cancer, while kept on the same diet, for 30 weeks.

We previously reported that a low versus high glycemic index (GI) diet on a high fat (30% kcal fat) background (LGI and HGI, respectively) significantly retarded adverse health effects in C57BL/6J male mice. The LGI diet enhanced whole body insulin sensitivity and repressed high fat diet-induced body and adipose tissue weight gain, resulting in reduced serum leptin and resistin levels (Faseb J 2009; 23: 1092-1101). How white adipose tissue (WAT) is effected is examined in the present study. We characterized the molecular mechanisms underlying the GI-mediated effects in WAT using whole genome transcriptomics technology. We show that a LGI vs. HGI diet mainly exerts its beneficial effects on substrate metabolism, especially insulin signaling of fatty acid metabolism. In addition, cell adhesion and cytoskeleton remodeling showed reduced expression in line with lower WAT mass, but it might also be due to altered insulin sensitivity. An important transcription factor showing enhanced expression is PPARgamma. Furthermore, serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol were significantly reduced by a LGI vs. HGI diet, and muscle insulin sensitivity was significantly increased as analyzed by PKB/Akt phosphorylation. Cumulatively, even though these mice were fed a high fat diet, the low versus high GI induced significantly favorable changes in metabolism in WAT. These effects suggest a partial overlap with pharmacological approaches by thiazolidinediones (TZDs) to treat insulin resistance and statins and plantsterols/stanols for hypercholesterolemia. It is therefore tempting to speculate that such a dietary approach might beneficially support pharmacological treatment of insulin resistance or hypercholesterolemia in humans. We analyzed 19 epididymal whie adipose tissue (epiWAT) samples from a 13 week High fat diet, Low glycemic index dietary group (LGI, n=9) versus a High fat diet, High glycemic index dietary group (HGI, n=10) after 13 weeks of feeding wildtype C57BL/6J male adult mice.

Knockout of the ubiquitously expressed microRNA-17~92 cluster in mice produces a lethal developmental defect and blocked B lymphopoiesis. We validated the equally widely expressed Bcl2l11 gene as joint target of miR-17~92 cluster members. Bcl2l11 encodes the pro-apoptotic protein BIM, central to life-death decisions in most mammalian cells. To study the contribution of miR-17~92:Bim interaction to miR-17~92 overall function, we set up a system of conditional mutagenesis of the Bim 3'UTR in mice. Ago2 Photoactivatable-Ribonucleoside Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation (AGO2 PAR-CLIP) allowed us to assess whether the seed match mutations introduced into the Bim 3'UTR in vivo indeed precluded interaction with the miRNAs of the 17~92 cluster. This analysis was done in Abelson Virus transformed B cell progenitors which we generated from wild type and Bim3'UTRmut/mut E14.5 fetal livers, knowing that these cells express both BIM and miR-17~92, can be expanded to large numbers and incorporate 4-thiouridine sufficiently well. Focusing on 21 nt windows around the 9 putative miR-17~92 seed matches in the Bim 3'UTR and excluding reads lacking T-to-C transitions, we we verified that the introduced mutationsare functional, and we discovered differential seed match coverage in the wild type, with one miR-19 seed match co-dominating with two miR-92 seed matches, while in the mutant 3'UTR miR-17~92 binding was completely abolished. These results demonstrate functionality and efficiency of our genetically engineered mouse model for in vivo conditional seed-match inactivation.

Human transcriptome array analysis of human cord blood mononuclear leokocytes from neonates exposed to histological chorioamnionitis and compared with healthy neonatesHistological chorioamnionitis (HCA) is an infection of fetal membranes and complicates 5.2% to 28.5% of all live births. Exposure to HCA may have long-term consequences including an increased risk for allergic disorders and asthma later in childhood, the mechanism(s) of which are still not yet well understood. Our objective was to determine the mRNA transcriptome of cord blood mononuclear leukocytes from term neonates and identify key genes and pathways involved in HCA. We found several key genes differentially expressed with exposure to HCA. These transcriptomes included novel genes and pathways associated with exposure to HCA. The differential gene expression included the key genes regulating inflammatory, immune, respiratory and neurological pathways, which may contribute to disorders in those pathways in neonates exposed to HCA.

Chronic viral infections are characterized by a state of CD8 T cell dysfunction termed exhaustion. A better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate CD8 T cell responses during chronic infection is required to improve immunotherapies that restore function in exhausted CD8 T cells. Here we identify a novel population of virus-specific CD8 T cells with a T follicular helper (Tfh)-like signature in mice chronically infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). These Tfh-like CD8 T cells expressed the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitory receptor but at the same time also expressed co-stimulatory molecules and had a gene signature that was related to CD8 T cell memory precursor cells and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). These Tfh-like CD8 T cells acted as stem cells during chronic infection undergoing self-renewal and also differentiating into the terminally exhausted CD8 T cells that were present in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. The Tfh-like CD8 T cells were found only in lymphoid tissues and resided predominantly in the T cell zones along with naive CD8 T cells. Interestingly, the proliferative burst after PD-1 blockade came almost exclusively from this Tfh-like CD8 T cell subset. Importantly, the transcription factor TCF1 played a cell intrinsic and essential role in the generation of Tfh-like CD8 T cells. Taken together, our study identifies Tfh-like CD8 T cells as the critical subset for maintaining the pool of virus-specific CD8 T cells during chronic infection and as the cells that proliferate after PD-1 blockade. These findings provide a better understanding of T cell exhaustion and have implications towards optimizing PD-1 directed immunotherapy. 8 samples isolated from CD8 T-cells in LCMV clone 13 GK1.5 infected mice (2 naive, 3 CXCR5+Tim3-, 3 CXCR5-Tim3+) cells were analyzed.",

Bazedoxifene and conjugated estrogens (CE+BZA) combination has been shown to prevent visceral adiposity and weight gain after menopause. However, its interaction with the microbiota has yet to be examined. In the present study, we use several -omics technologies to characterize the effects of various estrogens on the health of gut-liver axis. As reported in previous studies, CE+BZA combination is very effective at preventing ovariectomy-induced weight gain in mice fed a high-fat diet. Additionally, CE+BZA induces unique liver transcriptomic and blood metabolite profiles compared to estradiol, conjugated estrogens alone, and bazedoxifene alone. Several pathways and metabolites influenced are associated with lower rates of inflammation and overall benefits to gut and liver health. Finally, microbiome analysis shows that several bacterial species that potentially metabolize estrogens and affect their half-life in the body were significantly changed in CE+BZA treated mice. Our findings indicate a possible link between certain estrogens and gut microbiome and suggest a metabolic benefit of estrogens through manipulation of the gut-liver axis.

Cancer patients after successful therapy contain nested in their organs and/or circulating in the systemic fluids tumor cells that remain asymptomatic for an extended period of time. They stay dormant with no apparent immediate potential to develop into a clinically manifested tumor until activated by yet not well defined mechanisms. In the present study, we developed tumor dormancy model of murine melanoma, a cancer with a high potential of phenotype plasticity to adapt to micro-environmental changes, in which to investigate cellular quiescence and related factors as a potential mechanism of tumour dormancy. To explore molecular mechanism responsible for cellular dormancy, we performed a comparative transcriptome analysis of dormant B16F1-GFP-D and maternal B16F1-GFP-M cells.Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) is a nuclear receptor highly expressed by colonic epithelial cells. It plays a key role in gut homeostasis and metabolism regulation. We previously showed that PPARgamma has a role in the action of aminosalycilates (5-ASA), one of the oldest anti-inflammatory agents used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. These data have prompted us to develop novel analogues of 5-ASA with greater PPARgamma-activating properties (GED).The various PPARgamma ligands appear to have some markedly different effects, some of which can induce adverse effects. The transcriptomic profiles induced by various families of PPARgamma ligands are very poorly known and especially in intestinal epithelial cells. Hence, the objectives of the present project are to compare the gene expression profile induced by GED, 5-ASA, and pioglitazone in Caco-2 cells, in order to better understand these compounds' modes of action, to discover potential new PPARgamma target genes in intestinal epithelial cells and to explain the efficacy difference between GED and 5-ASA. 1 million of B16F1-GFP-M and B16F1-GFP-D melanoma cells were cultured in DMEM 10% FBS medium.

In the last years, independent studies attempted to identify biomarkers of frailty at biological level, but no consensus has been reached to date. In this work, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of 25 robust and frail community-dwelling individuals based on Timed Up and Go, Gait Speed and Tilburg Frailty Indicator scales. The comparison between individuals classified as frail or robust by the three tools revealed the expression of 35 transcripts associated with frailty status.

Identifying the early gene program induced by GnRH would help understand how GnRH-activated signaling pathways modulate gonadotrope secretory response. We previously analyzed GnRH-induced early genes in LbT2 cells, however these lack GnRH self-potentiation, a physiological attribute of gonadotropes. To minimize cellular heterogeneity, rat primary pituitary cultures were enriched for gonadotropes by 40-60% using a sedimentation gradient. Given the limited number of gonadotropes, RNA was amplified prior to microarray analysis. Thirty-three genes were up-regulated 40 minutes after GnRH stimulation. Real-time PCR confirmed regulation of several transcripts including fosB, c-fos, egr-2 and rap1b, a small GTPase and member of the Ras family. GnRH stimulated rap1b gene expression in gonadotropes, measured by a sensitive single cell assay. Immunocytochemistry revealed increased Rap1 protein in GnRH-stimulated gonadotropes. These data establish rap1b as a novel gene rapidly induced by GnRH and a candidate to modulate gonadotropin secretion in rat gonadotropes. Primary rat gonadotrope cells were exposed to 10 nM GnRH for 40 min, then harvested and processed for RNA extraction using a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).

    "text": "Subunit-specific vs. non-selective proteasome modulation in limiting inflammation in experimental colitis. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis, is characterized by chronic relapsing inflammation of the gut. It has been shown that increased proteasomal activity is associated with the expression of immunoproteasomes, which enhances NF-kB activation and thus promotes inflammation in IBD-patients. Here, we investigate whether modulation of the proteasomal activity is a suitable therapeutic approach to limit inflammation in colitis. This concept was tested in two different experimental setups. First, development of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis was tested in lmp7-/--mice, which lack the essential immunoproteasome-subunit LMP7 or in wildtype-mice treated with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Compared to WT mice, lmp7-/- mice revealed significantly attenuated colitis resulting from reduced NF-kB activation in the absence of LMP7. Further, treatment with bortezomib revealed dose-dependent amelioration of DSS-induced inflammation. In both approaches proteasome modulation limited the infiltration of neutrophils, consequently reducing tissue damage. In summary our experiments demonstrate that modulation of the proteasomal activity is effective in attenuating experimental colitis. In particular, our data suggest that the immunoproteasome-subunit LMP7 is a suitable target for the therapy of IBD. Microarray experiments were performed as dual-color hybridizations. To compensate for dye-specific effects, a dye-reversal color-swap was applied. Samples of proximal colon were cut longitudinally, washed in PBS, shortly incubated in 4M Guanidinium-isothiocyanat and transferred to TRIzol (Invitrogen).",

Self-renewal is a defining characteristic of stem cells, however the molecular pathways underlying its regulation are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that conditional inactivation of the Pbx1 proto-oncogene in the hematopoietic compartment results in a progressive loss of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) that is associated with concomitant reduction in their quiescence, leading to a defect in the maintenance of self-renewal as assessed by serial transplantation. Transcriptional profiling revealed that multiple stem cell maintenance factors are perturbed in Pbx1-deficient LT-HSCs, which prematurely express a large subset of genes, including cell cycle regulators, normally expressed in non-self-renewing multipotent progenitors. A significant proportion of Pbx1-dependent genes are associated with the Tgf-b pathway, which serves a major role in maintaining HSC quiescence. Pbx1-deficient LT-HSCs are unable to up-regulate the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p57 in response to Tgf-b, providing a mechanism through which Pbx1 maintenance of stem cell self-renewal is achieved.

    "text": "Systematic Functional Dissection of Common Genetic Variation Affecting Red Blood Cell Traits [Microarray]. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of associations between common genetic variants and human disease phenotypes, but the majority of these variants are non-coding, often requiring genetic fine-mapping, extensive epigenomic profiling, and individual reporter assays to delineate potential causal variants. We employ a massively parallel reporter assay to simultaneous screen 2756 variants in strong linkage-disequilibrium with 75 sentinel variants associated with red blood cell traits. We show that this assay identifies elements with erythroid-specific endogenous regulatory activity. Across 23 variants, we conservatively identified 32 putative causal variants (PCVs). We demonstrate endogenous enhancer activity for three PCVs that predominantly affect the transcription of SMIM1, RBM38, and CD164 using targeted genome editing. Functional follow up of RBM38 delineates a key role for this gene in the dramatic alternative splicing program occurring during terminal erythropoiesis. Finally, we provide evidence for how common GWAS-nominated variants can disrupt cell-type specific transcriptional regulatory pathways. We infected K562 cells with a HMD-GATA1 lentiviral vector that overexpresses GATA1 as described previously and below (Ludwig et al., 2014). RNA was isolated 48 hours after infection and cDNA was synthesized as described below. Microarrays (GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST Arrays, Affymetrix) were performed on K562 for control (HMD) and GATA1 overexpression (HMD+GATA1). Raw files were processed and normalized using the RMA algorithm from the oligo package in R 3.2 (Carvalho and Irizarry, 2010). Differential expression analyses were conducted using limma (Ritchie et al., 2015). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed comparing GATA1 overexpression to control with gene set permutation (Subramanian et al., 2005). The erythroid differentiation signature gene set was derived by identifying the top 200 genes that were expressed significantly higher in intermediate erythroblasts (CD71+/ CD235a+) compared to colony forming unit erythroid cells (CD71+/ CD235a-) (Merryweather-Clarke et al., 2011).

The management of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) is very variable, depending on many specific aspects, such as the type of tumor, spread and patient general health. Several advances have been made with the newly developed somatostatin analogues to cure this type of malignancies. Somatostain analogues such as octreotide have been used in clinic to treat patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). However, the molecular mechanism leading either to successful therapy or acquired resistance to the analogues is still to large extent unclear. Patients develop drugs resistance during a long term treatment. Therefore, to identify the pivotal regulatory genes involved in the development of drug resistance is an actual challenge. We studied five human neuroendocrine tumor cell lines, CNDT2.5, KRJ1, QGP-1, NCI H720 and NCI H727. We also investigated a long-term treated CNDT2.5 by using octreotide. We performed gene expression profiling in all the human neuroendocrine cell lines. Keywords: Gene Expression profiling, treatment comparison. We investigated 5 human neuroendocrine cell lines, CNDT2.5 and KRJ1, established from ileum NETs, QGP1 by a pancreatic NET, NCI H720 and NCI H727 from bronchopulmonary NETs. CNDT2.5 cell were constantly treated with 1uM octreotide for 10 and 16 months. We isolated total RNA (Ambion, PARIS(tm) Kit) from 5 WT cell lines and CNDT2.5 treated with octreotide (Santostatin, Novartis). Total RNA was hybridized onto the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array by Affymetrix Uppsala Platform, UU. SE (Uppsala, Sweden). We first wanted to verify whether the different cell lines may become reliable models to study neuroendocrine signaling pathways. The main objective of this project aimed at understanding the mechanisms by which octrotide (Sandostatin, Novartis) alter cellular growth and differentiation of CNDT2.5 cells. We therefore focused on intermediate (10 months) and long stimulation (16 months) events triggered by sandostatin, which lead variation of CNDT.2.5 cells gene expression to identify potential pivotal genes involved in the development of drug resistance in neuroendocrine cells. .",

Transcriptional enhancers orchestrate cell-type specific gene expression programs critical to eukaryotic development, physiology, and disease. However, despite the large number of enhancers now identified, only a small number have been functionally assessed. Here, we develop MOsaic Single-cell Analysis by Indexed CRISPR Sequencing (Mosaic-seq), a method that measures one direct phenotype of enhancer repression: change of the transcriptome, at the single cell level. Using dCas9-KRAB to suppress enhancer function, we first implement a multiplexed system to allow the simultaneous measurement of the transcriptome and detection of sgRNAs by single cell RNA sequencing. We validate this approach by targeting the HS2 enhancer in the well-studied beta-globin locus. Next, through computational simulation, we demonstrate strategies to robustly detect changes in gene expression in these single cell measurements. Finally, we use Mosaic-seq to target 71 hypersensitive regions belonging to 15 super-enhancers in K562 cells by utilizing a lentiviral library containing 241 unique-barcoded sgRNAs. Our results demonstrate that Mosaic-seq is a reliable approach to study enhancer function in single cells in a high-throughput manner. The overall design consists of RNA sequencing in bulk and in single K562 cells. As a control, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of K562 cells expressing dCas9-KRAB and a control sgRNA targeting the non-expressed HSBP1 gene in two biological replicates. As a pilot project, we performed single cell RNA-Seq of dCas9-KRAB K562 cells after pooled infection of a library of 10 sgRNA viruses targeting promoters and enhancers in the beta-globin locus. As controls for this experiment, we individually infected these 10 sgRNAs and either performed 1) bulk RNA sequencing or 2) single cell RNA sequencing after pooling the separately infected cells. Finally, we scaled this single-cell approach to measure transcriptome changes for a library of 241 sgRNAs spanning 71 hypersensitive sites from 15 super-enhancers in K562 cells.",

Chronic neuropathic pain is a major morbidity of neural injury, yet its mechanisms are incompletely understood. Hypersensitivity to previously non-noxious stimuli (allodynia) is a common symptom. Here, we demonstrate that the onset of cold hypersensitivity precedes tactile allodynia and this temporal divergence was associated with major differences in global gene expression in dorsal root ganglia. Transcripts whose expression correlate with the onset of cold allodynia were nociceptor-related whereas those correlating with tactile hypersensitivity were enriched for immune cell activity. Selective ablation of TrpV1 lineage nociceptors resulted in mice that did not acquire cold allodynia but developed normal tactile hypersensitivity. Whereas depletion of macrophages or T cells reduced neuropathic tactile allodynia but not cold hypersensitivity. We conclude that neuropathic pain is contributed to by reactive processes of sensory neurons and immune cells, each leading to distinct forms of pain hypersensitivity, potentially allowing effective drug development targeted to each pain modality.

We have recently described sustained clinical recovery associated with dampened neuroinflammation and remyelination following transplantation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in a viral model of the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis. In order to test the general applicability of NPC transplantation, we developed a new method for the differentiation and purification of NPCs from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Herein, we investigated the therapeutic potential of NPCs generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in mice infected with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) that induces an immune-mediated demyelinating disease sharing clinical and histologic similarities to the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS). JHMV-infected mice intraspinally transplanted with EB (embryoid body)-derived NPCs (EB-NPCs) exhibited decreased accumulation of CD4+ T cells in the central nervous system that was concomitant with reduced demyelination at the site of injection. Dampened neuroinflammation and remyelination was correlated with a transient increase in CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) concentrated within the peripheral lymphatics. Importantly, pathological improvements were limited in comparison to our previous report on hESC-derived NPCs and did not result in significant clinical recovery. Further examination of EB-NPCs by whole genome expression analysis showed them to be significantly different than our previously published cells. These findings highlight an intrinsic disparity in the therapeutic potential of NPCs generated from pluripotent stem cells.Pluripotent stem cells were differentiated to neural precursor cells (NPCs) by two separate methods to study the differences in final cell type. The first method was a 4 factor 9 day directed differentiation. This was applied to WA09 embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as well as two lines of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that were developed in our lab HDF51iPSC and HDF69iPSC. The other method was a multistep process that included transition through an embryoid body (EB) stage. This was done with the used on the HDF51iPCS line. For controls we used the original pluripotent stem cell lines (WA09, HDF51iPSC and HDF69iPSC) as well as HDF417 which is a human dermal fibroblast line collected by our lab. 17 Samples were analyzed in this study. This included 4 pluripotent cell lines, 1 Fibroblast line and 12 NPC lines.",

Purpose: To determine the optimal RNA extraction and library generation protocols for mouse hippocampal tissue acquired by laser capture microdissection (LCM).Methods: Hippocampal subregion CA2 was captured from eight micron fresh frozen brain sections from AMIGO2 EGFP mice. Total RNA was extracted using the PicoPure (LCM standard) and QIAGEN micro RNeasy RNA extraction kits. RNA quantity and quality was assessed using a Bioanalzyer. Resulting RNA was used to generate cDNA libraries using NuGEN or SMARTer low input RNA-Seq library kits. We compared the effects of RNA quality and library generation approach to determine the methods that detected the greatest number of genes/exons with even coverage using minimal rounds of PCR.Results: We determined that the QIAGEN RNA extraction kit resulted in far superior RNA compared to the Picopure RNA extraction kit. We also found the NuGEN library generation kit that depletes ribosomal RNA towards the end of the protocol, led to higher cDNA library yields that required fewer rounds of PCR while providing even gene coverage and detection. RNA from laser-captured tissue from mouse hippocampus was extracted using two low input methods generating a lower quality RNA sample (RIN 7, PicoPure) and higher quality sample (RIN 9, QIAGEN). Each sample was used to prepare cDNA using two commerically available low-input library generation methods (Clontech or NuGEN). The effect of RNA quality and library generation method were compared. The effect of shearing cDNA and PCR amplification were also tested for libraries made with the QIAGEN extracted RNA and NuGEN library kits (3 libraries, 16, 18 or 20 cycles of PCR). The libraries were multiplexed and run on the Illumina NextSeq500 instrument.",

    "text": "Genome-wide analysis of hepatic cells upon infection with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or Hepatitis D virus (HDV). The same entry pathway is shared by HBV and HDV. Both viruses attach to hepatocytes via heparansulfate proteoglycan and utilize sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) for a specifc entry. This specific entry step is inhibited by Myrcludex B, a 47-aa lipopeptide myristoylated at the N-terminus. Here we compared the cellular response in the gene expression level triggerred by both viruses. The microarray data shows that HBV infection leads to a silent response but HDV infection triggers high level of innate response such as inteferon-stimulated genes (ISG) expression. Moreover, the response depends on the hepatic cell lines used for infection. Compared to HepG2 cells, HuH7 can not induce ISG even infected by HDV.Abstract of manuscript: Background & aims: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and D virus (HDV) co-infections cause the most severe form of viral hepatitis. HDV induces an innate immune response, but it is unknown how the host cell senses HDV and if this defense affects HDV replication. We aim to characterize interferon (IFN) activation by HDV, identify the responsible sensor and evaluate the effect of IFN on HDV replication. Methods: HDV and HBV susceptible hepatoma cell lines and primary human hepatocytes (PHH) were used for infection studies. Viral markers and cellular gene expression were analyzed at different time points after infection. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) required for HDV-mediated IFN activation and the impact on HDV replication were studied using stable knock-down or overexpression of the PRRs. Results: Microarray analysis revealed that HDV but not HBV infection activated a broad range of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) in HepG2NTCP cells. HDV strongly activated IFN-b and IFN-l in cell lines and PHH. HDV induced IFN levels remained unaltered upon RIG-I or TLR3 knock-down, but were almost completely abolished upon MDA5 depletion. Conversely, overexpression of MDA5 but not RIG-I and TLR3 in Huh7.5NTCP cells partially restored ISG induction. During long-term infection, IFN levels gradually diminished in both HepG2NTCP and HepaRGNTCP cell lines. MDA5 depletion had little effect on HDV replication despite dampening HDV-induced IFN response. Moreover, treatment with type I or type III IFNs did not abolish HDV replication. Conclusions: Active replication of HDV induces an IFN-b/l response, which is predominantly mediated by MDA5. This IFN response and exogenous IFN treatment have only a moderate effect on HDV replication in vitro indicating the adaption of HDV replication to an IFN activated state. HuH7 or HepG2 cell line stably expressing virus receptor human NTCP were generated and named as HuH7-hNTCP and HepG2-hNTCP. Both cells were infected with HBV or HDV for 9 days and then total RNA were exacted. Infection in the presence of Myrcludex B or uninfected cells were used as the control.",

Recent liver transcriptome analysis in this animal compared to wild-derived mice revealed higher expression of alpha2-macroglobulin (A2M) and cell adhesion molecules, which contribute to the naked mole-rat's cancer resistance. Notably, A2M is known to dramatically decrease with age in humans. We hypothesize that this might facilitate tumor development. Here we found that A2M modulates tumor cell adhesion, migration and growth by inhibition of tumor promoting signalling pathways, e.g. PI3K / AKT, SMAD and up-regulated PTEN via down-regulation of miR-21, in vitro and in tumor xenografts. A2M increases the expression of CD29 and CD44 but did not evoke EMT. Transcriptome analysis of A2M-treated tumor cells, xenografts and mouse liver demonstrated a multifaceted regulation of tumor promoting signalling pathways indicating a less tumorigenic environment mediated by A2M. By virtue of these multiple actions the naturally occurring A2M has strong potential as a novel therapeutic agent. 11 samples: 5 treated with PBS, 6 treated with A2M.",

Large Congenital Melanocytic Naevi have a higher propensity to malignant transformation compared to acquired naevi. They thus represent a good model for studying initial steps of melanocarcinogenesis. We have performed genotypic (karyotype, FISH and mutational analyses) and differential expression studies on a large cohort of medium (n=3) and large (n=24) congenital melanocytic naevi. Unlike malignant melanoma, chromosomal abnormalities were rare and single, a feature probably reflecting the benignity of these lesions. Mutational screening showed a high frequency of NRAS mutations in our series, while BRAF mutations were less common. Differential expression study between tumoral and normal melanocytes did not show significant alterations of cellular processes such as cell proliferation, cell migration/invasion, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and immune/inflammatory responses. However, significant down-regulation of genes involved in pigmentation and up-regulation of genes playing a role in DNA protection were observed. Lastly, our micro-arrays displayed up-regulation of genes mediating chemoresistance in cancer. As alteration of pigmentation mechanisms can trigger oxidative damage, increased expression of genes involved in maintenance of DNA integrity might reflect the ability of naevocytic cells to self protection against cellular stress. Furthermore, the observed alterations linked to chemoresistance might partially account for the well known inefficacy of chemotherapy in malignant melanoma.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive human malignancies with 7.1% five-year survival rate due to late-stage diagnosis and lack of effective treatment. A novel active compound to be useful for treating pancreatic cancer is absolutely demanded. Agaricus blazei (A. blazei) Murrill has been shown to have an anti-cancer activity, however, its specific efficacy and underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that A. blazei hot water extract (AbE) showed significant growth inhibition of cultured pancreatic cancer cells with less suppressive effect on the normal human pancreatic duct epithelial cells. The pancreatic cancer cells committed G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, we uncovered significant alterations of global gene expression in the pancreatic cancer cells by AbE treatment. Signature of alteration of gene expression indicated that AbE induced repression of genes associated with kinetochore function, spindle formation, centromere maintenance, and cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases, which were essential for cell cycle progression. The gene expression analysis also showed upregulation of proapoptotic genes. These results indicate that AbE could be useful for treatment of pancreatic cancer and a good candidate to isolate potent active compound for development of novel drug for pancreatic cancer. Cells of a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line were seeded at 250,000 cells/10 cm dish with an appropriate growth medium. After 24 hours of the seeding, the growth medium was replaced with the growth medium with 0.045 % Agaricus blazei Murrill hot water extract (AbE) as treated or the growth medium with water in the same volume of AbE as control (mock). Adherent cells were collected after 48 hours of the treatment. Total RNAs were extracted from both control and treated cells using RNeasy midi kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the supplier's instructions. cRNAs labelled with Cyanin 3 were synthesized by means of the T7-linear amplification method from 500 ng of the total RNAs employing Low RNA Input Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, U.S.A.) and purified using RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN).

An improved understanding of the anti-tumor CD8+ T cell response after checkpoint blockade would enable more informed and effective therapeutic strategies. Here we examined the dynamics of the effector response of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) after checkpoint blockade therapy. Bulk and single-cell RNA profiles of CD8+ TILs after combined Tim-3+PD-1 blockade in preclinical models revealed significant changes in the transcriptional profile of PD-1? TILs. These cells could be divided into subsets bearing characterstics of naive-, effector-, and memory-precursor-like cells. Effector- and memory-precursor-like TILs contained tumor-antigen-specific cells, exhibited proliferative and effector capacity, and expanded in response to different checkpoint blockade therapies across different tumor models.

Background: mRNA interactions with each other and other signaling molecules define different biological pathways and functions. Researchers have been investigating various tools to analyze these types of interactions. In particular, gene co-expression network methods have proved useful in finding and analyzing these molecular interactions. Many different analytical pipelines to identify these interactions networks have been proposed with the aim of identifying an optimal partition of the network where the individual modules are neither too small to make any general inference or too large to be biologically interpretable. Results: In this study, we propose a new pipeline to perform gene co-expression network analysis. The proposed pipeline uses WGCNA, a widely used software to perform different aspects of gene co-expression network analysis and modularity maximization algorithm to analyze novel RNA-Seq data to understand the effects of low-dose 56Fe ion irradiation on the formation of hepatocellular carcinoma in mice. The network results along with experimental validation show that using WGCNA combined with Modularity provide a more biologically interpretable network in our dataset. Our pipeline showed better performance than the existing clustering algorithm in WGCNA in finding modules and identified a module with mitochondrial subunits that are supported by mitochondrial complex assay. Conclusions: We present a pipeline that can reduce the problem of parameter selection with the existing algorithm in WGCNA for comparable RNA-Seq datasets which may assist in future research to discover novel mRNA interactions and their downstream molecular effects. C57BL16 males were placed into 2 treatment groups and received the following irradiation treatments at Brookhaven National Laboratories (Long Island, NY): 600 MeV/n 56Fe (0.2 Gy), and no irradiation. Left liver lobes were collected at 30, 60, 120, 270, and 360 days post-irradiation, flash frozen and stored at -80degC until they could be processed for RNA-Seq. Livers were sampled by taking two 40-micron thick slices using a cryotome at -20degC. This allowed multiple sampling of the tissue without the tissue going through multiple freeze/thaw cycles. Total RNA was isolated from the liver slices using RNAqueousTM Total RNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and rRNA was removed via Ribo-ZeroTM rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) prior to library preparation with the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library kit.

    "text": "Carbon-ion radiotherapy of human lung cancer. Carbon-ion irradiation is an emerging therapeutic option for several tumor entities including lung cancer. Well oxygenated tumor areas compared to a hypoxic environment favor therapeutic photon irradiation efficiency of solid tumors due to increased amounts of DNA damage. The resistance of hypoxic tumor areas towards photon irradiation is enhanced through increased HIF-1 signaling. Here, we compared the effects of oxygen and HIF 1 after photon and carbon-ion irradiation with biological equivalent doses in a human non-small lung cancer model. In hypoxia compared to normoxia, A549 and H1299 cells displayed improved survival after photon irradiation. Knockdown of HIF-1a combined with photon irradiation synergistically delayed tumor growth in vivo. Photon irradiation induced HIF-1a and several of its target genes such as PDK1, GLUT-1, LDHA, and VEGF with subsequent enhanced tumor angiogenesis in vivo, a signaling cascade that was not targeted by carbon-ion irradiation. We present evidence that photons but not carbon-ions induce HIF-1a via mTOR pathway. Importantly, after carbon-ion irradiation in vivo, we observed substantial downregulation of HIF-1a and a drastically delayed tumor growth indicating a considerable higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) than anticipated from the cell survival data. In sum, our results demonstrate that carbon-ions mediate an improved therapeutic response of tumor treatment compared to photon irradiation that is independent of cell oxygenation and HIF-1 signaling. 16 independent cell cultures were used. Each culture was split into an irradiated and a control plate, yieldin a total of 16 paired samples. Paired samples were analysed in 16 two-color hybridizations. Factors time (after irradiation) with levels 1h and 4h and factor radiation quality with levels C12 and X-rays were analyzed. Each of the 2x2 combinations was analyzed in 4 independent experiments.",

Biomaterial scaffolds have the potential to enhance neuronal development and regeneration. Understanding the genetic responses of astrocytes and neurons to biomaterials could facilitate the development of synthetic environments that enable the specification of neural tissue organization with engineered scaffolds. In this study, we used high throughput transcriptomic and imaging methods to determine the impact of a hydrogel with no known bioactive epitopes, Puramatrix(tm), on human glial cells in vitro. Parallel studies were undertaken with cells grown in a monolayer environment on tissue culture polystyrene. When the Normal Human Astrocyte (NHA) cell line is grown in a hydrogel matrix environment, the glial cells adopt a structural organization that resembles that of neuronal-glial cocultures, where neurons form clusters that are distinct from the surrounding glia. Statistical analysis of next generation RNA sequencing data uncovered a set of genes that are differentially expressed in the monolayer and matrix hydrogel environments. Functional analysis demonstrated that hydrogel-upregulated genes can be grouped into three broad categories: neuronal differentiation and/or neural plasticity, response to neural insult, and sensory perception. Our results demonstrate that hydrogel biomaterials have the potential to transform human glial cell identity, and may have applications in the repair of damaged brain tissue.

Leptospirosis is a re-emerging tropical infectious disease caused by the pathogenic Leptospira spp. The different host innate immune responses were partially related to the different severity of leptospirosis. In this study, we employed transcriptomics and cytokine array to comparatively calculate the responses of murine peritoneal macrophages (MPM) and human peripheral blood monocytes (HBM) to leptospiral infection, and uncover a series of different expression regulations of these two immune cells. The regulation percentages in several biological processes of MPM, such as the antigen process and presentation, the regulation of membrane potential, and the innate immune response, etc., were much greater than those of HBM (>2 folds). In HBM and MPM, the CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator genes were significantly up-regulated, which supported previous results that the caspase-8/3 pathway plays an important role in macrophage apoptosis during leptospiral infection. The key component of complement pathway, C3, was only up-regulated in MPM. Several cytokines (e.g. IL-10, TNF-alpha) were differently expressed at both mRNA and protein level in MPM and HBM. The differences in the transcriptomics and the cytokine expression revealed in this study were partially consistent with the different outcomes of the chronic and acute leptospirosis; thus, these findings facilitated further molecular study on the innate immune response to leptospiral infection. Murine peritoneal macrophages (MPM) and human peripheral blood monocytes (HBM) were infected by pathogenic Leptospira. The host cells were collected at 1h, 2h, and 4h after infection.

Several reports have focused on the identification of biological elements involved in the development of abnormal systemic biochemical alterations in chronic kidney disease, but this abundant literature results most of the time fragmented. To better define the cellular machinery associated to this condition, we employed an innovative high-throughput approach based on a whole transcriptomic analysis and classical biomolecular methodologies. The genomic screening of peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed that 44 genes were up-regulated in both chronic kidney disease patients in conservative treatment (CKD, n=9) and hemodialysis (HD, n=17) compared to healthy subjects (NORM) (p<0.001, FDR=1%). Functional analysis demonstrated that 11/44 genes were involved in the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS). Western blotting for COXI and COXIV, key constituents of the complex IV of OXPHOS, performed on an independent testing-group (12 NORM, 10 CKD and 14 HD) confirmed the elevated synthesis of these subunits in CKD/HD patients. However, complex IV activity was significantly reduced in CKD/HD patients compared to NORM (p<0.01). Finally, CKD/HD patients presented higher reactive oxygen species and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels compared to NORM. Taken together these results suggest, for the first time, that CKD/HD patients may have an impaired mitochondrial respiratory system and this condition may be both the consequence and the cause of an enhanced oxidative stress. For microarray analysis, we studied subjects included in the training group. This population included 8 healthy subjects (NORM), 9 patients with Chronic kidney disease (CKD) on stage II-III (CKD II-III) (mean+-SD of estimated GFR by MDRD formula: 41.4+-4.3 ml/min) and 17 patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment (HD).All HD patients were stably treated, for at least 1 year, three times a week (4-5 hours per session), using synthetic membrane dialyzers. During the study period, no CKD patients received dialysis treatment. In addition, all patients suffering from infectious diseases, diabetes, chronic lung diseases, neoplasm, or inflammatory diseases and patients receiving antibiotics, corticosteroids, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents were excluded. No patients had symptomatic coronary artery diseases or a family history of premature cardiovascular diseases. For all subjects, 20 ml of whole blood were collected. For HD patient the biological material was obtained at the beginning of the second HD session of the week. PBMC were isolated by density separation over a Ficoll-PaqueTM (GE healthcare, Sweden) gradient (460g for 30 min). Cells were then counted and their viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion (>90% PBMC were viable).

Chronic viral infections are difficult to treat and new approaches, particularly those involving enhancing immune responses are needed. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) establishes latency, reactivates frequently, and breakthrough reactivation can occur despite suppressive antiviral therapy. Virus-specific T cells are important to control HSV, and activated T cells require increased metabolism of glutamine for their proliferation. We found that treatment of HSV-1 latently infected mice and HSV-2 infected guinea pigs with supplemental oral glutamine reduced virus reactivation. Transcriptome analysis of mice treated with glutamine showed that several interferon (IFN)-g inducible genes were upregulated. Unlike wild-type mice, supplemental glutamine was ineffective in reducing the rate of HSV-1 reactivation in IFN-g knock-out mice. Mice treated with glutamine had higher numbers of HSV-specific IFN-g producing CD8 T cells in latently infected ganglia. Thus, glutamine may enhance the IFN-g-associated immune response and reduce the rate of reactivation of latent virus infection.

Here we found that maternal cecal microbiota transfer (CMT) to NOD mice with early-life antibiotic perturbation partially rescued the induced T1D acceleration. The restoration effects on the intestinal microbiome were substantial and persistent, remediating the antibiotic-depleted diversity, relative abundance of particular taxa, and metabolic pathways. CMT also protected against perturbed cecal and serum metabolites and normalized innate and adaptive immune effectors. CMT restored patterns of ileal microRNA and histone regulation of gene expression and exon-splicing. Based on the analyses of experimental data, we propose an innate intestinal immune network involving CD44, TLR2, and Reg3g, as well as their multiple microRNA and epigenetic regulators that sense intestinal signaling by the gut microbiota.

The transcription factor ZNF217 is a candidate oncogene in the amplicon on chromosome 20q13 that occurs in 20-30% of primary human breast cancers and that correlates with poor prognosis. We show Znf217 overexpression drives aberrant differentiation and signaling events, promotes increased self-renewal capacity, mesenchymal marker expression, motility and metastasis, and represses an adult tissue stem cell gene signature downregulated in cancers. By in silico screening, we identified candidate therapeutics that at low concentrations inhibit growth of cancer cells expressing high ZNF217. We demonstrate that the nucleoside analog triciribine inhibits ZNF217-induced tumor growth and chemotherapy resistance, and inhibits signaling events (e.g., P-AKT, P-MAPK) in vivo. Our data suggest ZNF217 is a biomarker of poor prognosis and a therapeutic target in breast cancer patients, and triciribine may be part of a personalized treatment strategy in patients overexpressing ZNF217. Since ZNF217 is amplified in numerous cancers, these results have implications for other cancers. Total RNA was isolated from samples overexpressing ZNF217 (3 Primary and 5 SCp2).

IFN-g is a critical cytokine which regulates both innate and adaptive immune. Ample evidences have elucidated the mechanisms of IFN-g mediated antitumor effects, including driving T Helper Type 1 (Th1) polarization, activating cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) and natural killer T cells, upregulating major histocompatibility complex class I expression (MHC Class I) in tumor cells, and inhibiting tumor cells proliferation, inducing tumor cells apoptosis. Despite the multiple effects in cancer immune elimination phase (also known as cancer immune surveillance), IFN-g also effectuates antitumor immunity and protumorigenic activities throughout the cancer immunoediting process including elimination phase and escape phase. One of the most important mechanism elucidating the dual effect of IFN-g in immunoediting is IFN-g induced PD-L1 expression in cancer cells. To obtain a detailed molecular appreciation of what was going on in tumor microenvironment under the influence of IFN-g, we performed global gene expression analysis using the Agilent oligonucleotide microarray system. First, we evaluated the IFN-g expression in a uniform cohort of patients with IIIA lung adenocarcinoma from our patient archive. IFN-g expression was assessed by means of RT-PCR. The median DCt value from tested specimens was set as breakpoint, IFN-g expression below median DCt value was considered as low IFN-g group (IFN-g-) whereas above median DCt value was the high IFN-g group (IFN-g+). Then, we analyzed PD-L1 expression by IHC staining of biopsy specimens in whole slides. PD-L1 expression was quantified by multiplying the staining intensity scores by the percentage of positive cells. Biopsy specimens from 12 lung adenocarcinoma patients were included to perform the Agilent oligonucleotide microarray system. Six of biopsy specimens contain high levels of IFN-g while others expressing IFN-g at low or undetectable levels. Furthermore, we divided IFN-g+ group into two subgroups according to PD-L1 expression, three IFN-g+ specimens expressing PD-L1 (IFN-g+PD-L1+) but others not (IFN-g+PD-L1-).",

Background: Intrinsic glioma subtypes (IGS) are molecularly similar tumors that can be identified based on unsupervised gene-expression analysis. Here, we have evaluated the clinical relevance of these subtypes within EORTC26951, a randomized phase III clinical trial investigating adjuvant procarbazine, CCNU (lomustine) and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy in anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors. Our study is the first to include gene-expression profiles of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) clinical trial samples. Methods: Gene-expression profiling was performed in 140 samples: 47 fresh frozen and 93 FFPE, on HU133_Plus_2.0 and HuEx_1.0_st arrays (Affymetrix), respectively. Results: All previously identified six intrinsic glioma subtypes are present in EORTC26951. This confirms that different molecular subtypes are present within a well-defined histological subtype. Intrinsic subtypes are highly prognostic for overall- (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). They are prognostic for PFS independent of clinical (age, performance, tumor location), molecular (1p19qLOH, IDH1 mutation, MGMT methylation) and histological parameters. Combining known molecular (1p19LOH, IDH1) prognostic parameters with intrinsic subtypes improves outcome prediction (Proportion of Explained Variation 30% v 23%). Specific genetic changes (IDH1, 1p19qLOH and EGFR amplification) segregate into different subtypes. We identified one subtype, IGS-9 (characterized by a high percentage of 1p19qLOH and IDH1 mutations), that especially benefits from PCV chemotherapy. Median OS in this subtype was 5.5 years after radiotherapy (RT) alone v 12.8 years after RT/PCV; P=0.0349; HR 2.18, 95% CI [1.06, 4.50]. Conclusion: Intrinsic subtypes are highly prognostic in EORTC26951 and improve outcome prediction when combined with other prognostic factors. Tumors assigned to IGS-9 benefit from adjuvant PCV.

Previous work demonstrates hematopoietic changes in rodents exposed to various physical and psychological stressors, however, the effects of chronic psychological stress on erythropoiesis has not be delineated. We employed laboratory, clinical and genomic analyses of a murine model of chronic restraint stress (RST) to examine the influence of psychological stress on erythropoiesis. Mice exposed to RST demonstrated markers of early erythroid expansion involving the glucocorticoid receptor. In addition, these RST-exposed mice had increased numbers of circulating reticulocytes and increased erythropoiesis in primary and secondary erythroid tissues. Mice also showed increases in erythroid progenitor populations and elevated expression of the erythroid transcription factor KLF1 in these cells. Together this work describes some of the first evidence of psychological stress affecting erythroid homeostasis through glucocorticoid stimulation and begins to define the transcription factor pathway involved. RNA was extracted from thwe whole blood of RST mice (n = 4) and Control mice (N = 4) following seven days of restraint stress.",

    "text": "tourt-affy-human-131547. Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a neurotrophin that plays an important role in regulating the survival, growth, and differentiation of sympathetic neurons. Many in vitro studies indicate that Egr transcription factors are coupled to NGF signaling and are essential signaling mediators of NGF-dependent differentiation of sympathetic neurons, such as neuroblastoma cells and pheochromocytoma cells. Mice that are deficient for both Egr1 and Egr3 have profound sympathetic nerve system defects, including abnormal neuron degeneration and impaired differentiation (unpublished observations). To further understand the role of Egr genes in sympathetic neuron development, it is necessary to examine the signal transduction pathways involved in NGF-mediated Egr-dependent gene regulation. The results will be helpful in understanding the pathobiology of those diseases related to aberrant sympathetic neuron differentiation, such as neuroblastoma and dysautonomias, and may provide new insights into therapies for these refractory diseases.To identify NGF-mediated Egr-dependent target genes in human SH-SY5Y/TrkA neuroblastoma cells: Many potential Egr target genes have been described over the years. However, very few have been characterized to be involved in NGF-mediated sympathetic neuron differentiation. In order to further understand the role of Egr genes in sympathetic neuron development, it is necessary to examine the signal transduction pathways involved in NGF-mediated Egr-dependent gene regulation. Egr1 and Egr3 are rapidly induced after NGF treatment and Egr1 is involved in activation of the differentiation marker gene NPY in SH-SY5Y/TrkA cells. Therefore, SH-SY5Y/TtrkA cells appear to be an excellent model system to study the role of Egr transcription factors in sympathetic neuron differentiation in vitro. A dominant negative Egr molecule that specifically blocks transcriptional activity mediated by Egr transcription factors will be used in this study to identify Egr-dependent target genes.Egr1 and Egr3 are rapidly induced after NGF treatment in human SH-SY5Y/TrkA neuroblastoma cells, which in turn differentiate into sympathetic-like neurons. We hypothesize that Egr transcription factors are involved in activating downstream signaling pathways during NGF mediated differentiation of SH-SY5Y/TrkA cells. Moreover, we hypothesize that by using a dominant negative Egr (dnEgr) molecule that blocks all Egr mediated gene transcription and Affymetrix microarray analysis, it will be possible to identify NGF-mediated Egr transcription dependent gene regulatory networks that may be involved in growth and differentiation of neuroblastoma. An unbiased approach to understanding these gene regulatory networks may lead to new insights relating to NGF signaling involved in neuronal growth and differentiation.Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y/TrkA cells will be infected with either dnEgr-expressing adenovirus (SH-SY5Y/TrkA-dnEgr) or with EGFP-expressing control adenovirus (SH-SY5Y/TrkA-EGFP). Equivalent infection efficiency and lack of viral toxicity will be verified by EGFP fluorescence microscopy 24 hours after infection and the cells will be treated with NGF (100 ng/ml). Total RNA will be extracted from SH-SY5Y/TrkA (uninfected), SH-SY5Y/TrkA-dnEgr, and SH-SY5Y/TrkA-EGFP cells treated with NGF for 0, 1 hour and 3 hours. Total RNA will be prepared from all of the samples and a portion subjected to real-time PCR analysis to ensure that NGF mediated Egr gene induction was not altered by the context of viral infection. Pilot experiments demonstrate that Egr genes are still induced in the context of viral infection greater than 100-fold. Egr1 mRNA peak expression is known to occur at 1 hour and decrease by 3 hours after NGF treatment in all of the samples. The peak expression of Egr target genes is expected to occur later than Egr1 peak expression since Egr1 proteins need to be expressed first to initiate the transcription of target promoters. Therefore, the RNA samples from SH-SY5Y/TrkA-dnEgr and SH-SY5Y/TrkA-EGFP treated with NGF for 3 hours will be used to probe Affymetrix high-density human genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays to identify differentially expressed genes. RNA amplification for probe synthesis should not be necessary since we will provide 10 ug of intact total RNA for each sample. We will provide three sets of samples to perform the comparative microarray analysis twice from different starting materials and a nine-way comparative analysis of the data will be performed. We expect that cells containing high levels of dnEgr will inhibit NGF mediated Egr-dependent target gene expression and that these gene networks should be identifiable when compared to EGFP infected cells that have normal Egr gene transcriptional activity.Keywords: time-course. as above.",

Next to a persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), molecular changes are required for the development of cervical cancer. To identify which molecular alterations drive carcinogenesis, we performed a comprehensive and longitudinal molecular characterization of HPV-transformed keratinocyte cell lines. Comparative genomic hybridization, mRNA, and miRNA expression analysis of four HPV-containing keratinocyte cell lines at eight different time points was performed. Data was analyzed using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, integrated longitudinal expression analysis, and pathway enrichment analysis. Biological relevance of identified key regulatory genes was evaluated in vitro and dual-luciferase assays were used to confirm predicted miRNA-mRNA interactions. We show that the acquisition of anchorage independence of HPV-containing keratinocyte cell lines is particularly associated with copy number alterations. Approximately one third of differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNAs was directly attributable to copy number alterations. Focal adhesion, TGF-beta signaling, and mTOR signaling pathways were enriched among these genes. PITX2 was identified as key regulator of TGF-beta signaling and inhibited cell growth in vitro, most likely by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Predicted miRNA-mRNA interactions miR-221-3p_BRWD3, miR-221-3p_FOS, and miR-138-5p_PLXNB2 were confirmed in vitro. Integrated longitudinal analysis of our HPV-induced carcinogenesis model pinpointed relevant interconnected molecular changes and crucial signaling pathways in HPV-mediated transformation.

Aberrant splicing is a hallmark of leukemias with mutations in splicing factor (SF)-encoding genes. Here we investigated its prevalence in pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL), where SFs are not mutated. By comparing them to normal pro-B cells, we found thousands of aberrant local splice variations (LSVs) per sample, with 279 LSVs in 241 genes present in every comparison. These genes were enriched in RNA processing pathways and encoded ~100 SFs, e.g. hnRNPA1. hnRNPA1 3'UTR was most pervasively misspliced, yielding the transcript subject to nonsense-mediated decay. Thus, we knocked it down in B-lymphoblastoid cells, identified 213 hnRNPA1-dependent splicing events, and defined the hnRNPA1 splicing signature in pediatric leukemias. One of its elements was DICER1, a known tumor suppressor gene; its LSVs involved the 5' UTR, suggestive of splicing as a mechanism of translational deregulation. Additionally, we searched for LSVs in other leukemia and lymphoma drivers and discovered 81 LSVs in 41 genes. 77 LSVs were confirmed using two large independent B-ALL RNA-seq datasets. In fact, the twenty most common B-ALL drivers showed higher prevalence of aberrant splicing than of somatic mutations. Thus, post-transcriptional deregulation of SF can drive widespread changes in B-ALL splicing and likely contribute to disease pathogenesis. Refer to individual Series.",

Functional validation of candidate genes, selected from an integrated analysis that used SNP, expression and AUC data, was performed with multiple cancer cell lines using specific siRNA knockdown, followed by MTS and colony-forming assays. 27 loci, each containing at least 2 SNPs within 50kb with p-values <10-4, were associated with radiation AUC. 270 expression probe sets were associated with radiation AUC with p<10-3.

Cultured cancer cells exhibit substantial phenotypic heterogeneity when measured in a variety of ways such as sensitivity to drugs or the capacity to grow under various conditions. Among these, the ability to exhibit anchorage-independent cell growth (colony forming capacity in semisolid media), has been considered to be fundamental in cancer biology, because it has been connected with tumor cell aggressiveness in vivo such as tumorigenic and metastatic potentials, and also utilized as a marker for in vitro transformation. Although multiple genetic factors for anchorage-independence have been identified, the molecular basis for this capacity is still largely unknown. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying anchorage independent cell growth, we have used genome-wide DNA microarray studies to develop an expression signature associated with this phenotype. Using this signature, we identify a program of activated mitochondrial biogenesis associated with the phenotype of anchorage-independent growth and importantly, we demonstrate that this phenotype predicts potential for metastasis in primary breast and lung tumors.Keywords: Breast cancer cell lines with various colony-forming ability.

The translocation t(10,11)(p13;q14) resulting in the formation of the CALM/AF10 fusion gene is involved in various hematological malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and malignant lymphoma and is usually associated with poor prognosis. We established a knock-in mouse model allowing tissue-specific CALM/AF10 expression from the Rosa26 locus using a loxP-STOP-loxP cassette to study leukemic transformation by the CALM/AF10 fusion protein during hematopoiesis. vav-Cre induced pan-hematopoietic expression of the CALM/AF10 fusion gene led to acute leukemia with a median latency of 12 months. Leukemias were either myeloid or had myeloid feature and showed expression of the B cell marker B220. Gene expression profiling of leukemic bone marrow cells revealed the overexpression of Hoxa cluster genes and the Hox co-factor Meis1. The long latency to leukemia development suggested that additional, collaborative genetic lesions are required. We identified an average of 2 to 3 additional mutations per leukemia using whole-exome sequencing. When CALM/AF10 was expressed in the B lymphoid compartment using mb1-Cre or CD19-Cre inducer lines no leukemia development was observed. Our results indicate that CALM/AF10 needs to be expressed from the stem or early progenitor cell stage onward to permit the acquisition of additional mutations required for leukemic transformation. Total RNA was extracted from BM cells of leukemic (n=8) and pre-leukemic CA+/vav-Cre+ mice (n=3) and of wild type C57Bl/6 mice (n=3) and from the B cells of CA+/mb1-Cre+ mice (n=3), pre-leukemic CA+/vav-Cre+ mice (n=3) and of wild type C57Bl/6 mice (n=3) using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany).

CLK2 is a member of the CLK family that phosphorylates serine- and arginine-rich (SR) proteins of the spliceosomal complex as part of a regulatory mechanism for control of pre-mRNA splicing. SR proteins are a family of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) splicing factors involved in constitutive and alternative splicing. Monitoring specific phospho-biomarkers of CLK2 demonstrated that CC-671 inhibited phosphorylation of CLK2 substrates in cancer cells with mean IC50 of 549 nM in the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) line CAL51. In this study, RNA sequencing approach was used to quantify the impact of CC-671 treatment on gene transcription and global alternative splicing in CAL51 cells. Differential exon usage analysis demonstrated that CC-671 changed alternative splicing of many genes. In addition, different sets of genes are impacted by CC-671 at both the alternative splicing and mRNA expression. Genes impacted by alternative splicing shared a set of common pathways with genes altered by mRNA expression. This result indicates that CC-671 regulates transcription via both gene expression and alternative splicing mechanisms. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) line CAL51 was grown in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, as recommended by vendor. The growing cells were treated by CC-671 in three biological replicates at the following concentrations and time intervals. The treatment time points were 6 hour and 24 hour.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory and destructive joint disease, characterized by overexpression of pro-inflammatory/-destructive genes and other activating genes (e.g., proto-oncogenes) in the synovial membrane (SM). The gene expression in disease is often characterized by significant inter-individual variances via specific synchronization/ desynchronization of gene expression. To elucidate the contribution of the variance to the pathogenesis of disease, expression variances were tested in SM samples of RA patients, osteoarthritis (OA) patients, and normal controls (NC).Results. For the comparison between RA and NC, 568 genes with significantly different variances in the 2 groups (p < 0.05; Bonferroni/Holm corrected Brown-Forsythe version of the Levene-Test) were selected. For the comparison between RA and OA, 333 genes were selected. Using the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG), 10 pathways/complexes significantly affected by higher gene expression variances were identified in RA compared to NC, including cytokine - cytokine receptor interactions, the TGF-pathway, and anti-apoptosis.Compared to OA, 3 pathways with significantly higher variances were identified in RA (e.g., B cell receptor signaling, VEGF signaling). Functionally, the majority of the identified pathways is involved in the regulation of inflammation, proliferation, cell survival, and angiogenesis.Conclusion. In RA, a number of disease-relevant or even disease-specific pathways/complexes are characterized by broad intra-group, inter-individual expression variances. This indicates that RA pathogenesis in different individuals may depend to a lesser extent on common alterations of the expression of specific key genes, but on individual-specific alterations of different genes resulting in common disturbances of key pathways. Expression variances were tested in synovial membrane samples of rheumatoid arthritis patients, osteoarthritis patients, and normal controls (see publication for further details). .",

Chromatin modifying activities for construction of appropriate epigenetic landscapes by polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) play an essential role in development and tumorigenesis. However, the spatiotemporal mechanisms by which PRC2 achieves diverse epigenomes for specific tissue or cellular contexts remain poorly understood. Here, we discovered that LATS2 knockout causes dysregulation of PRC2 and subsequent transcriptome changes for differentiation in both mouse and human cells. LATS2 depletion dependent dysregulation of PRC2 also effects H3K4me3 and forms negative feedback loop for maintenance of PRC2. Further analyses reveal that LATS2 on chromatin binds to EZH2 and LATS2 has ability to phosphorylate PRC2 in vitro. These LATS2 dependent H3K27me3 targets are highly induced during neurogenesis, and statistical analysis of glioblastoma multiforme reveals that LATS2-high cases show more dedifferentiated transcriptome and poor prognosis with silencing of H3K27me3 targets.

In the current work, we comprehensively characterize the SUM44/LCCTam ILC model system through integrated analysis of gene expression, copy number, and mutation, with the goal of identifying actionable alterations relevant to clinical ILC that can be co-targeted along with ER to improve treatment outcomes. We show that TAM has several distinct effects on the transcriptome of LCCTam cells, that this resistant cell model has acquired copy number alterations and mutations that impinge on MAPK and metabotropic glutamate receptor (GRM/mGluR) signaling networks, and that pharmacological inhibition of either improves or restores the growth-inhibitory actions of endocrine therapy.These samples form a SuperSeries with GSE12708.

    "text": "TosR-mediated regulation of adhesins and biofilm formation in uropathogenic Escherichia coli. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli utilize a variety of adherence factors that assist in colonization of the host urinary tract. TosA (type one secretion) is a non-fimbrial adhesin that is predominately expressed during murine urinary tract infection (UTI), binds to kidney epithelial cells, and promotes survival during invasive infections. The tosRCBDAEF operon encodes the secretory machinery necessary for TosA localization to the E. coli cell surface, as well as the transcriptional regulator TosR. TosR binds upstream of the tos operon and, in a concentration dependent manner, either induces or represses tosA expression. TosR is a member of the PapB family of fimbrial regulators that can participate in crosstalk between fimbrial operons. TosR also binds upstream of the pap operon and suppresses PapA production. However, the scope of TosR-mediated crosstalk is understudied and may be underestimated. To quantify the global effects of TosR-mediated regulation on the E. coli CFT073 genome, we induced expression of tosR, collected mRNA, and performed RNA-Seq. These findings show that production of TosR affected the expression of genes involved with adhesins, including P, F1C, and Auf; nitrate/nitrite transport; microcin secretion; and promoted biofilm formation. Examination of three biological replicates of CFT073 harboring pBAD or pBAD-tosR.",

Lsd1KO and ATRA treatment in Hoxa9/Meis1- and MN1-transformed myeloid progenitor cellsLSD1 has emerged as a promising epigenetic target in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Inhibition of LSD1 has been shown to induce differentiation and facilitate the responsiveness of AML cells to all-trans retinoic acid. We used two murine AML models based on retroviral overexpression of Hoxa9/Meis1 (H9M) or MN1 to study the effect of Lsd1 knockout in AML. The conditional knockout of Lsd1 resulted in differentiation with both granulocytic and monocytic features in H9M-induced AML cells and enhanced their responsiveness towards ATRA treatment, which was not seen in MN1-driven AML. It also extended the survival of mice with H9M-driven AML. To identify molecular changes associated with the loss of Lsd1, we performed whole transcriptome analysis by RNA sequencing of H9M and MN1 Lsd1 fl/fl (Ctrl) and Lsd1cKO cells with or without ATRA treatment. The experiment was done in triplicates. The conditional knockout led to a broad increase in the expression of multiple genes regulated by the important myeloid transcription factors GFI1 and PU.1.

Human endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) represent one of the most promising sources of adult stem cells for vascular regeneration after ischemia. Yet, the molecular mechanism underlying the unique properties of these cells to repair damaged blood vessels remains unclear, and new strategies to improve their regenerative function are needed. Here, we demonstrate that ex vivo treatment of ECFCs with a combination of epigenetic drugs (i.e. the histone H3K27 demethylase inhibitor GSK-343 and the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat) improves the migration of these cells and their capacity to form capillary-like networks while also increasing their resistance to serum starvation-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the kinetic of blood flow recovery is significantly increased upon transplantation of drug-treated ECFCs in a pre-clinical model of hind-limb ischemia. Gene expression profiling by RNA-sequencing reveals that these effects are mediated through the simultaneous activation of several major pro-angiogenic signaling pathways including VEGFR, CXCR4, WNT, NOTCH and SHH. At the molecular level, we provide evidence that the two drugs work through complementary mechanisms that entail the resolving of bivalently marked genes characterized by the presence of both negative (H3K27me3) and positive (H3K4me3 and H3-Ac) histone modifications to create a transcriptionally permissive chromatin environment. Thus, ex vivo treatment with epigenetic drugs increases the vascular repair properties of ECFCs through transient activation of major pro-angiogenic signaling pathways.

    "text": "Study of gene expression alteration in male androgenetic alopecia: evidence of predominant molecular signaling pathways. Background: The male androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most common form of hair loss in men and is hereditary in more than 80% of cases and characterized by a distinct pattern of progressive hair loss starting from the frontal area and the vertex of the scalp. Although several genetic risk loci have been identified, relevant genes for AGA remain to be identified. Objectives: Herein, molecular biomarkers associated with premature AGA were identified through gene expression analysis using cDNA generated from scalp skin vertex biopsies of hairless/bold men with premature AGA and healthy volunteers. Results: This monocentric study reveals that genes encoding mast cell granule enzymes, inflammatory and immunoglobulin-associated immune mediators were significantly over-expressed in AGA. In contrast, under-expressed genes appear to be associated with the Wnt/b-catenin and BMP/TGF-b signaling pathways. Although the involvement of these pathways in hair follicle regeneration is well-described, functional interpretation of the transcriptomic data highlights different events that account for their inhibition. In particular, one of these events depends on the dysregulated expression of proopiomelanocortin (POMC), as confirmed by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. In addition, a lower expression of CYP27B1 in AGA patients supports that alteration of vitamin D metabolism contributes to hair loss. Conclusion: Altogether, this study provides evidence for distinct molecular events contributing to alopecia that might be targeted for new therapeutic approaches. monocentric study of scalp punch biopsy from AGA patients and healthy donors.",

The Ewing Sarcoma protein (EWS) is a multifaceted RNA binding protein (RBP) with established roles in transcription, pre-mRNA processing, and DNA damage response. By generating high quality EWS-RNA interactome, we uncovered its specific and prevalent interaction with a large subset of primary microRNAs (pri-miRNA). Depletion of EWS reduced, while overexpression enhanced, the expression of its target miRNAs. Biochemical analysis revealed that multiple elements in target pri-miRNAs, including the sequences flanking the stem-loop region, contribute to EWS binding and sequence swap between target and non-target demonstrated that the flanking sequences provide the specificity for enhanced pri-miRNA processing by the Microprocessor Drosha/DGCR8. Interestingly, as previously reported and we confirmed, EWS appears to repress Drosha expression, and we further demonstrated that EWS is able to enhance the recruitment of Drosha to the chromatin. Together, these findings suggest that EWS may positively and negatively regulate miRNA biogenesis, but via distinct mechanisms, thus providing a new foundation to understand the function of EWS in development and disease.

Heterogeneity of CAFs has long been observed, however, the functional heterogeneity of CAFs between patients and their genetic basis are far less known. Here, we report the distinction of two CAF subtypes obtained from primary cultures of CAFs and matched normal fibroblasts (NFs) from 28 resected NSCLC. These 28 pathological NSCLC (82 % adenocarcinoma) were categorized into two types according to the histological properties of the peritumoral stroma: High desmoplasia (HD; n=14), and low desmoplasia (LD; n=14), and the prognostic significance evaluated. This classification seems to align with functional CAFs, as those with HD have higher rate of gel contraction, higher rate of tumor growth and poor prognosis. To demonstrate a gene expression profile specific to CAF activity we used Illumina DASAL Microarray gene expression analysis on extracted RNA from 24 CAF cell lines (12 CAFs-HD and 12 CAFs-LD) that were embedded in collagen gel for 24 hours. From the CAF cohort, the most significant genes that are correlated with the desmoplasia are identified to be enriched in the clinical cohort of 181 NSCLC patients.

To identify some key pathways related to this toxicity, we studied the transcriptomic profile of human intestinal Caco-2 cells exposed to a sub-toxic concentration of CYN (1.6 uM for 24hrs) using a non-targeted approach. CYN was shown to modulate different biological functions which were related to growth arrest (with down-regulation of cdkn1a and uhrf1 genes), and DNA recombination and repair (with up-regulation of aptx and pms2 genes). Our main results reported an increased expression of some histone-modifying enzymes (histone acetyl and methyltransferases MYST1, KAT5 and EHMT2) involved in chromatin remodelling, which is essential for initiating transcription. We also detected greater levels of acetylated histone H2A (Lys5) and dimethylated histone H3 (Lys4), two products of these enzymes. In conclusion, CYN overexpressed proteins involved in DNA damage repair and transcription, including modifications of nucleosomal histones.

Inhibition of MYC promises high therapeutic potential, but specific MYC inhibitors remain unavailable for clinical use. Previous studies suggest that MYC amplified Medulloblastoma cells are vulnerable to HDAC inhibition. Using co-immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry and ChIP-sequencing we show that HDAC2 is a cofactor of MYC in MYC amplified primary medulloblastoma and cell lines. The MYC-HDAC2 complex is bound to genes defining the MYC-dependent transcriptional profile. Class I HDAC inhibition leads to stabilization and reduced DNA binding of MYC protein inducing a down-regulation of MYC activated genes (MAGs) and up-regulation of MYC repressed genes (MRGs). MAGs and MRGs are characterized by opposing biological functions and distinct E-box distribution. We conclude that MYC and HDAC2 (class I) are localized in a complex in MYC amplified medulloblastoma and drive a MYC-specific transcriptional program, which is reversed by the class I HDAC inhibitor entinostat. Thus, the development of HDAC inhibitors for treatment of MYC amplified medulloblastoma should include HDAC2 in its profile in order to directly target MYC's trans-activating and trans-repressing function.

The differentially expressed genes were obtained by paired t-tests with p<0.05 and interpreted using Venn diagrams, functional enrichment and protein interaction network analyses. Validation of microarray results was carried out through qPCR experiments of selected genes. We found a high number of significant genes with low fold changes in gene expression at the time intervals studied. These genes were regulated in a time dependent-manner, with most gene expression changes being exclusive to one of the time intervals evaluated. Our results indicated that blocking AT1 or AT2 changed the expression of genes involved in regulation of transcription, cell cycle, cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, cell adhesion, cell migration, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, protein transport and protein ubiquitination. Additionally, the signaling pathways over-represented by the significant genes were ErbB, mTOR, MAPK, neurotrophin, insulin and Wnt. Finally, interactome analyses revealed hub genes associated with cell proliferation, survival, migration, transport, structural support, neurotrophin pathway, MAPK signaling and Wnt signaling. Taken together, our findings implicate Ang II-transcriptional regulation in glioma progression by means of the modulation of genes participating in protumoral functions. This transcriptome pattern is observed upon Ang II activation of either AT1 or AT2 receptors, thereby highlighting the relevance of both receptor subtypes in glioma progression. Interactome analyses disclosed hub genes regulated by Ang II which may present higher control over their networks. These genes participate in biological functions that could enhance the degree of malignancy in gliomas and thus should be further explored. C6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 Units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded in cell culture dishes and incubated at 37degC/ 5% CO2 until becoming confluent. Then, these cells were pre-treated (30 minutes) with either AT1 receptor antagonist (Losartan: 10-5M) or AT2 receptor antagonist (PD123319: 10-5M) followed by Ang II treatment (10-7 M) according to the treatment scheme: Group 1 - control; Group 2 - cells only treated with Ang II; Group 3 - cells pre-treated (30 minutes) with Losartan and then treated with Ang II; Group 4 - cells pre-treated (30 minutes) with PD123319 and then treated with Ang II. To identify which genes were significantly differentially expressed, paired t-tests (p<0.05) were performed in the following comparisons: Ang II x Control (3h); Ang II x Control (6h); Ang II +Los x Ang II (3h); Ang II +Los x Ang II (6h); Ang II +PD123319 x Ang II (3h); Ang II +PD123319 x Ang II (6h).",

    "text": "Small molecule activation of PKM in cancer cells induces serine auxotrophy. Proliferating tumor cells use aerobic glycolysis to support their high metabolic demands. Paradoxically, increased glycolysis is often accompanied by expression of the lower activity PKM isoform, effectively constraining lower glycolysis. Here, we report the discovery of novel PKM activators with a unique allosteric binding mode. Characterization of how these compounds impact cancer cells revealed an unanticipated link between glucose and amino acid metabolism. PKM activation resulted in a metabolic rewiring of cancer cells manifested by a profound dependency on the non-essential amino acid serine for continued cell proliferation. Induction of serine auxotrophy by PKM activation was accompanied by reduced carbon flow into the serine biosynthetic pathway and increased expression of high affinity serine transporters. These data support the hypothesis that PKM expression confers metabolic flexibility to cancer cells that allows adaptation to nutrient stress. A549 cancer cells were treated with compound-16 for up to 24 hours in the presence and absence of serine in the media.",
