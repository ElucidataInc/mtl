Fig 1B outlines our strategy for identifying a common signature of DE for the fructose effect on the two base diets. To combine the information from the CD DF(NS) and CD DF(HS) vectors, a secondary vector CD DF(common) with common values \"vc\" was generated by gene-wise calculating the geometric mean of the values (vi) of DF(NS) and DF(HS), whereby the geometric mean of two numbers v1i and v2i is defined as follows: The CD method takes into account the information inherent in the covariance matrix of the expression data, i.e., co-regulation, in addition to the usual mean difference between experimental and control data, and generates a DE vector that quantitatively reflects the relative contribution of each gene to overall differential expression.

The dose-response curve demonstrated the high sensitivity and linearity of the assay in the range of 0.2-10 U/mL of IFNg.
