Successful gene therapy for b-thalassemia requires optimal numbers of autologous gene-transduced hematopoietic progenitors stem cells (HPSC) with high repopulating capacity and mobilization is the optimal approach for achieving this goal. We performed a clinical study to investigate safety and efficacy of G-CSF+AMD3100 mobilization in four adult with b-thalassemia to reach a cell dose of >=8x106 CD34+cells/Kg and to characterize the CD34+cell populations mobilized before and after plerixafor administration. The procedure resulted well-tolerated in all patients. Three of the four patients reached the target cell dose or more in single-apheresis collections, even one patient where a significant dose reduction of G-CSF was imposed due to early hyperleukocytosis. A significant increase in the number of circulating CD34+ cells/ul (12.1+- 8.2 fold), and in the frequency of the more primitive CD34+/CD133+/CD38- cells (1.7+-0.7 fold) was unanimously observed after AMD3100 addiction. Intraindividual comparison of gene expression profile of CD34+ cells mobilized with G-CSF versus G-CSF+ AMD3100 highlighted a different expression pattern of genes involved in the processes of HSC/stroma adhesion, homing, cell motility and transcription regulation. Overall, the safety profile, the yield, and the expression of genes that potentially promote superior engraftment depict G-CSF+AMD3100 mobilized HSC as optimal graft source for b-thalassemia gene therapy.

    "text": "Norrin-dependent gene expression in cerebellar granule neuron progenitors. Medulloblastoma (MB), a tumor of the cerebellum, is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. One third of all human MB exhibits a gene expression signature of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. Hedgehog (Hh) pathway inhibitors have shown efficacy in clinical trials for MB, however, tumors develop resistance to these compounds, highlighting the need to identify additional therapeutic targets for treatment. We have identified a role for Norrin signaling in tumor initiation in the Patched (Ptch) mouse model of MB. Norrin is a secreted factor that functions as an atypical Wnt by binding to the Frizzled4 (Fzd4) receptor on endothelial cells to activate canonical beta-catenin-mediated Wnt signaling pathway. In the cerebellum, activation of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling is required for the establishment and maintenance of the blood brain barrier (BBB). We have identified a role for Norrin signaling in the stroma as a potent tumor inhibitory signal. Inactivation of Norrin in Ptch+/- mice significantly shortens latency and increases MB incidence. This phenotype is associated with an increased frequency of pre-tumor lesions and their conversion to malignancy. In this context, loss of Norrin signalling in endothelial cells is associated with an accelerated transition to a pro-tumor stroma characterized by vascular permeability, inflammation and angiogenic remodelling. Accordingly, loss of Ndp significantly alters the stromal gene expression signature of established Ptch MB. Ptch+/- mice were maintained on a C57Bl/6 background. NdpKO mice, generated by disruption of the Ndp locus by a lacZ-containing cassette were obtained from Lexicon Pharmaceuticals (Junge et al., 2009) and maintained by interbreeding on a mixed background. Ndp is an X-linked gene and Ndp+/- females were crossed with Ptch+/- males, to generate male (Ndp-/y;Ptch+/-) NdpKO;Ptch+/- compound mutants. All compound mutants were compared to single Ptch+/- or wild-type controls from the same breeding cohort to ensure matched backgrounds. Granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) were isolated from postnatal day 6 (P6) cerebella of WT, Ptch+/- and Ndp-/y;Ptch+/- mice. MB tumors were dissected from the cerebella of symptomatic Ptch and Ndp-/y;Ptch+/- mice.

For the clinical treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), it is important not only to improve the airflow limitation by bronchodilation but also to suppress emphysema by controlling inflammation. In this study, we have screened for compounds that prevent elastase-induced airspace enlargement in mice from medicines already used clinically. Mepenzolate bromide, a muscarinic antagonist used to treat gastrointestinal disorders was selected. Intratracheal administration or inhalation of mepenzolate bromide decreased the severity of elastase-induced airspace enlargement, alteration of lung mechanics and respiratory dysfunction. While mepenzolate bromide showed bronchodilatory activity, most of other muscarinic antagonists tested did not improve the elastase-induced pulmonary disorders. Mepenzolate bromide suppressed elastase-induced pulmonary inflammatory responses and production of superoxide anions, and reduced the level of cigarette smoke-induced airspace enlargement and alteration of lung mechanics. Based on these results, we propose that this drug is therapeutically effective for COPD as a consequence of both its anti-inflammatory and bronchodilatory activities. In order to understand the mechanism governing mepenzolate-dependent decrease in inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, we performed DNA microarray analysis at the lung of mepenzolate-administered (or control) mice. We then analyzed gene sets that were differently expressed at 25 hours after administration of mepenzolate using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).",

Background: Meniscus tears are the most common injury in the knee and are associated with an increased risk of osteoarthritis (OA). The molecular profile of knees with meniscus tears is not well-studied. Therefore, to advance our understanding of the early response of the knee to injury, we compared the gene expression profile of meniscus and articular cartilage within the same knees following meniscus injury. Hypothesis/Purpose: To identify differences between the molecular signatures of meniscus and articular cartilage from knees with intact articular cartilage undergoing arthroscopic partial meniscectomy. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study Methods: Patients (n=12) with a known isolated medial meniscus tear without any knee chondrosis or radiographic OA were consented prior to surgery. During arthroscopic partial meniscectomy, a sample of their injured meniscus and a sample of their articular cartilage off the medial femoral condyle were procured. The transcriptome signatures, as measured through Affymetrix microarray, were compared between the two tissues and underlying biological processes were explored computationally.Results: 3566 gene transcripts were differentially expressed between meniscus and articular cartilage. Gene transcripts down-regulated in articular cartilage were associated with extracellular matrix organization, wound healing, cell adhesion, and chemotaxis. Gene transcripts up-regulated in articular cartilage were associated with blood vessels morphogenesis and angiogenesis. Examples of individual genes with significant differences in expression between the two tissues include IBSP (23.76 fold; P < 0.001), upregulated in meniscus, and TREM1 (3.23 fold; P = 0.006), upregulated in meniscus.

Through microarray analysis, we have uncovered the distinct molecular signatures that define and distinguish ipsilateral and contralateral RGCs during the critical period of axonal outgrowth and decussation, with over three hundred genes differentially experienced within these two cell populations. Amongst the genes upregulated in ipsilateral RGCs are many that are known to be expresed in progenitors cells and mark \"immaturity,\" including Math5 (Atoh7), Sox2, and cyclin D2. Many of these differentially regulated genes were subsequently validated via in vivo expression analysis.

We used microarrays to assess the overal global gene expression differences from Tcf1 wildtype and deficient lymphoid biased progenitors cultures on Notch-ligand expressing stroma to determine if Tcf1 deficient progenitors are able to intiate the T lineage specification program.Abstract of manuscript: The thymus imposes the T cell fate on incoming multipotent progenitors, but the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We show that transcription factor Tcf1 initiates T-lineage-specific gene expression. Tcf1 is downstream of Notch1 signaling and expressed in early T-cell progenitors. Progenitors deficient for Tcf1 are unable to initiate normal T-lineage specification. Conversely, ectopic expression of Tcf1 in hematopoietic progenitors is sufficient to induce expression of T-lineage specific genes in vitro. Thus, our study identifies Tcf1 as critically involved in the establishment T cell identity. Tcf1 wildtype and deficient bone marrow lymphoid primed progenitors (LMPPs, Lineage marker- Sca+kit+Flt3high) were harvested in triplicate and seeded onto OP9-DL4 expressing stroma for 4 days upon which highly pure lineage negative and Thy1+CD25+ T cells were cell sorted for expression analysis.

We show here that the elevated levels of miR-155 in type III latency cells is due to EBV gene expression and not epigenetic differences in cell lines tested and we show that expression in EBV infected cells requires a conserved AP-1 element in the miR-155 promoter. Gene expression analysis was carried out in a type I latency cell line transduced with a miR-155 expressing retrovirus. This analysis identified both miR-155 suppressed and induced cellular mRNAs and suggested that in addition to direct targeting of 3' UTRs, miR-155 alters gene expression in part through the alteration of signal transduction pathways. 3' UTR reporter analysis of predicted miR-155 target genes identified the transcriptional regulatory genes, BACH1, ZIC3, HIVEP2, CEBPB, ZNF652, ARID2, and SMAD5 as miR-155 targets. Western blot analysis of the most highly suppressed of these, BACH1, showed lower expression in cells transduced with a miR-155 retrovirus. Inspection of the promoters from genes regulated in EBV infected cells and in cells infected with a miR-155 retrovirus identified potential binding sequences for BACH1 and ZIC3.

This splice signature was associated with poor metastasis-free survival (MFS) in hormone receptor-negative non-IBC (p=0.02), whereas it had no prognostic value in IBC patients. A PAM analysis of deregulated genes in IBC compared to non-IBC identified a 10-gene signature highly predictive of IBC phenotype and conferring a poor prognosis in non-IBC. The most up-regulated genes in IBC were 3 hemoglobin genes able to highly discriminate IBC from non IBC (p<10-4). In epithelial breast tumor cells, Hb protein expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Conclusions: IBC has a specific spliced transcript profile that deserves further functional studies. Above all, IBC is characterized by hemoglobin genes overexpression, a fact that may lead to increased tumor progression. If confirmed, hemoglobins may serve as therapeutic targets.

Purpose: Our experimental results demonstrate an essential role for the lncRNA HOTAIR in Ewing sarcoma. We have repressed HOTAIR expression in three Ewing sarcoma cell lines and overexpressed HOTAIR, alone and with EWS-FLI1, in htert-immortalized human mesenchymal stem cells to evaluate its effects on gene expression in this cancer.Methods: RNA-Seq of Ewing sarcoma cell lines with HOTAIR represssed by GapmeR or treated with nonsilencing control, and hTERT-immortalized hMSCs with expression of control GFP, HOTAIR, or HOTAIR and EWS-FLI1, was used for gene expression analysis.Results: Defined gene expression signatures were defined as driven by HOTAIR in each cell line model, with a consensus set of gene identified in the Ewing sarcoma cell lines. Additionally, a set of genes regulated by HOTAIR independently of EWS-FLI1 was identified in the hTERT-hMSC models.Conclusions: HOTAIR expression regulates a set of genes critical to viability, cell adhesion, cell motility, and other markers of EMT and metastasis in Ewing sarcoma, independently of EWS-FLI1. Ewing sarcoma cell lines SKES, ES2, and A673 were treated with locked nucleic acic antisense oligonucleotides (GapmeR, Exiqon) against either HOTAIR or a nonsilencing control for 48 hours, then had RNA isolated using the Nucleospin RNA isolation kit. hTERT-immortalized human mesenchymal stem cells were obtained from Applied Biological Materials and infected with lentivirus expressing GFP and PuroR with or without HOTAIR, then subsequently with lentivirus expressing either BFP and PuroR with or without EWS-FLI1, and stable clones were selected by puromycin treatment. RNA was isolated as above and used for RT-qPCR, by which expression of HOTAIR and EWS-FLI1 was confirmed. RNA from these samples was then used for quality assessment, then for RNA-Seq in quadruplicate for each sample, using the Illumina HiSeq4000.",

Sweat glands play a fundamental role in thermal regulation in man, but the molecular mechanism of their development remains unknown. To initiate analyses, we compared the model of Eda mutant Tabby mice, in which sweat glands were not formed, to wild-type mice. We inferred developmental stages and critical genes based on observations at 7 time points spanning embryonic, postnatal and adult life. In wild-type footpads, sweat gland germs were detected at E17.5. The coiling of secretory portions started at postnatal day 1 (P1), and sweat gland formation was essentially complete by P5. Consistent with a controlled morphological progression, expression profiling revealed stage-specific gene expression changes. Similar to the development of hair follicles the other major skin appendage controlled by EDA sweat gland induction and initial progression was accompanied by Eda-dependent up-regulation of the Shh pathway. During the further development of sweat gland secretory portions, Foxa1 and Foxi1, not at all expressed in hair follicles, were progressively up-regulated in wild-type but not in Tabby footpads. Upon completion of wild-type development, Shh declined to Tabby levels, but Fox family genes remained at elevated levels in mature sweat glands. The results provide a framework for the further analysis of phased downstream regulation of gene action, possibly by a signaling cascade, in response to Eda.Keywords: cell type comparison design,development or differentiation design.

Cpt2A-/- brown adipose tissue (BAT) failed to induce thermogenic genes such as Ucp1 and Pgc1a in response to adrenergic stimulation, which is exacerbated by increasing temperature.

Fragile X premutation carriers (fXPC) of the CGG expansion in the 5'-UTR of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene are at high risk of Fragile X Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), and females might undergo Premature Ovarian Failure (POF1). We have evaluated the peripheral blood gene expression profiles of fXPC and detected a strong deregulation of genes enriched in FXTAS-relevant biological pathways, including inflammation, and neuronal homeostasis and survival. More than 30% of differentially expressed correspond to long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Several deregulated genes (CASP3, DFFA, APP, AKT1, COX6C, COX7B, SOD1, RNF10, HDAC5, ATXN7, ATXN3 and EAP1) were validated in brain samples of a mouse model of FXTAS and in neuronal cells expressing the expanded FMR1 5'-UTR. One of the validated genes is the early at menopause 1 (EAP1) gene. We confirmed the EAP1 deregulation both in male and female fXPC. Down-regulation was stronger in female fXPC with POF1 compared with female fXPC without POF1. Increased levels of FMR1 mRNA were detected in all brain areas of the CGG-KI mouse model. EAP1 was significantly downregulated in the brainstem and cerebellum of the KI mouse, suggesting that EAP1 levels in certain brain areas could contribute to POF in this model. All together, these results suggest that gene expression profiling in blood of fXPC reflects changes in the brain transcriptome that may underlie neuropathological aspects in FXTAS and of POF.

Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) has been explored as a vaccine vector for use against infectious diseases and cancer. MVA is an immunogenic, attenuated poxvirus capable of eliciting robust cellular and humoral responses in pre-clinical animal models and in patients. However, upon infection with MVA, cells undergo rapid apoptosis leading to faster clearance of recombinant antigens. The fragmentation of the anti-apoptotic gene B13R in MVA could contribute to this effect. Here, we replaced the fragmented B13R with a functional version and observed that MVA-B13R infected HeLa cells and muscle cell lines delayed caspase 3 activation compared to MVA indicating slower progression of apoptosis. For immunogenicity studies, mice were intramuscularly immunized with recombinant MVA or MVA-B13R expressing SIV Gag, Pol and HIV Env (SHIV). We observed higher Env-specific humoral responses from MVA-B13R SHIV compared to MVA SHIV mice. To determine differences in the innate immune response that may have contributed to the augmented humoral response, we performed RNA-Seq analysis on draining lymph node cells after immunization. Gene set enrichment analysis from day 1 after immunization showed that MVA-B13R SHIV immunizations were associated with a negative enrichment for type I and II interferon responses compared to MVA SHIV mice indicating MVA-B13R SHIV induces a delayed anti-viral interferon response that may lead to the enhanced humoral response observed. Taken together, these results demonstrate that restoring B13R functionality in MVA significantly delays MVA-induced apoptosis, augments Env-specific antibody responses, and is associated with reduced interferon-alpha and interferon-gamma responses induced after vaccination. Female BALB/c mice were intramuscularly immunized at 10^7 pfu/dose with MVA expressing SHIV antigens or MVA-B13R expressing SHIV.

Elevated c-Jun levels result in apoptosis and are evident in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia and after global cerebral insults such as stroke and epilepsy. NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonists block c-Jun upregulation and prevent neuronal cell death following excitotoxic insults. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate c-Jun abundance in neurons. Here we show that PRR7, a component of synaptic junctions, can upregulate c-Jun levels by inhibiting its ubiquitination in neurons. PRR7 interacts with the GLUN1 subunit of NMDARs and is upregulated in the nucleus following NMDAR activation. We show that PRR7 interacts with the E3 ligase SCFFBW7 (FBW7) and blocks the FBW7-mediated ubiquitination of c-Jun. PRR7 overexpression increases c-Jun-dependent transcriptional activity and promotes neuronal death. Microarray assays indicate that both Prr7 knockdown or overexpression alter the abundance of c-Jun-regulated transcripts associated with cellular viability as well as synaptic function. Moreover, Prr7 knockdown attenuates NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity in primary neuronal cultures. Our results show that PRR7 links NMDAR activity to c-Jun function and provide insight into the processes that underlie NMDA-dependent excitotoxicity. Four biological replicas of each of the four conditions: NO = not transduced with virus; NT = transduced with control lentiviruses containing a non-targeting shRNA sequence; KD = transduced with lentiviruses expressing PRR7-specific shRNAs; OE= transduced with lentiviruses to overexpress PRR7.",

Here we identify the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain containing transcriptional regulators (BETs) as epigenetic drivers of an ASD-like disorder in mice. We found that the pharmacological suppression of the BET proteins by a novel, highly selective and brain-permeable inhibitor, I-BET858, leads to selective suppression of neuronal gene expression followed by the development of an autism-like syndrome in mice. Many of the I-BET858 affected genes have been linked to ASD in humans thus suggesting the key role of the BET-controlled gene network in ASD.

The use of integrated approaches in genetic toxicology, including the incorporation of gene expression data to determine the molecular pathways involved in the response, is becoming more common. In a companion paper, a genomic biomarker was developed in human TK6 cells to classify chemicals as genotoxic or non-genotoxic. Because TK6 cells are not metabolically competent, we set out to broaden the utility of the biomarker for use with chemicals requiring metabolic activation. Specifically, chemical exposures were conducted in the presence of rat liver S9. The ability of the biomarker to classify genotoxic (benzo[a]pyrene, BaP; aflatoxin B1, AFB1) and non-genotoxic (dexamethasone, DEX; phenobarbital, PB) agents correctly was evaluated. Cells were exposed to increasing chemical concentrations for 4h and collected 0h, 4h and 20h post-exposure. Relative survival, apoptosis, and micronucleus frequency were measured at 24h. Transcriptome profiles were measured with Agilent microarrays. Statistical modeling and bioinformatics tools were applied to classify each chemical using the genomic biomarker. BaP and AFB1 were correctly classified as genotoxic at the mid- and high concentrations at all three time points, whereas DEX was correctly classified as non-genotoxic at all concentrations and time points. The high concentration of PB was misclassified at 24h, suggesting that cytotoxicity at later time points may cause misclassification. The data suggest that the use of S9 does not impair the ability of the biomarker to classify genotoxicity in TK6 cells. Finally, we demonstrate that the biomarker is also able to accurately classify genotoxicity using a publicly available dataset derived from human HepaRG cells. This experiment examined the whole genome transcriptional response of TK6 cells exposed to Dexamethasone for 4 hours followed by a 0h, 4h and 20h recovery in fresh media (4h, 8h, and 24h time points, respectively) at 2 different concentrations, including 0.63 mM and 1mM, in addition to negative controls (+-S9), vehicle controls (+-S9) and a direct-acting positive control, cisplatin (-S9) at 24 mg/ml (PC-24).

Choline kinase alpha (CHKA) plays a crucial role in the regulation of membrane phospholipid synthesis and has oncogenic properties in vitro. We have analyzed the expression of CHKA in cell lines derived from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and have found increased CHKA expression and a good correlation between protein expression and sensitivity to MN58b, a CHKA inhibitor that reduced cell growth through the induction of apoptosis. Accordingly, CHKA knockdown led to reduced drug sensitivity. In addition, we found that gemcitabine-resistant PDAC cells displayed enhanced sensitivity to CHKA inhibition and, in vitro, MN58b had synergistic effects with gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin, three active drugs in the treatment of PDAC. Using tissue microarrays, CHKA was found to be overexpressed in 90% of pancreatic tumors. While cytoplasmic CHKA did not relate to survival, nuclear CHKA distribution was observed in 43% of samples and was associated with survival, especially among patients with well/moderately differentiated tumors. To identify the mechanisms involved in resistance to CHKA inhibitors, we cultured IMIM-PC-2 cells with continuous incremental concentrations of MN58b and isolated a subline with a 30-fold higher IC50. RNA-Seq analysis identified up-regulation of ABCB1 and ABCB4 multidrug resistance transporters and functional studies confirmed that their up-regulation is the main mechanism involved in resistance. Overall, our findings support the notion that CHKA inhibition merits further attention as a therapeutic option in patients with PDAC. RNA profile from parental and MN58b-resistant IMIM-PC-2 were generated by deep sequencing were done in triplicates using illumina GAIIx.",

Background:Neuronal cells respond to changes in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) by affecting both the abundance and the architecture of specific mRNAs. While Ca2+-induced transcription and transcript variation have both been recognized as important sources of gene regulation, the interplay of these two phenomena has not been evaluated together on a genome scale.Results:Here, we show that exon-centric microarrays can be used to resolve the Ca2+-modulated gene expression response into transcript-level and exon-level regulation. Global assessments of affected transcripts reveal modulation within distinct functional gene categories. We find that transcripts containing Ca2+-modulated exons show enrichment for Ca2+-ion binding, calmodulin-binding, plasma membrane-associated, and metabolic proteins. Additionally, we uncover instances of regulated exon use in potassium channels, neuroendocrine secretory proteins, and in metabolic enzymes, and demonstrate that regulated changes in exon expression give rise to distinct transcript isoforms.Conclusions:Our findings connect extracellular stimuli to specific exon behavior and suggest that changes in transcript and exon abundance are reflective of a coordinated gene expression response to elevated [Ca2+]i.

Neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are a remarkable tool for modeling human neural development and diseases. However, it remains largely unknown whether the hPSC-derived neurons can be functionally coupled with their target tissues in vitro, which is essential for understanding inter-cellular physiology and further translational studies. Here, we demonstrate that hPSC-derived sympathetic neurons can be obtained from hPSCs and that the resulting neurons form physical and functional connections with cardiac muscle cells. By use of multiple hPSC reporter lines, we recapitulated human autonomic neuron development in vitro, and successfully isolated PHOX2B::eGFP+ neurons exhibiting sympathetic marker expression, electrophysiological properties, and norepinephrine secretion. With pharmacological and optogenetic manipulations, the PHOX2B::eGFP+ neurons controlled the beating rates of cardiomyocytes, and their physical interaction led to neuronal maturation. Our study lays a foundation for the specification of human sympathetic neurons and for the hPSC-based neuronal control of end organs in a dish. Using the four genetic reporter systems (OCT4::eGFP, SOX10::eGFP, ASCL1::eGFP, and PHOX2B::eGFP reporter hESC lines), we were able to purify discrete cell populations at four differentiation stages, recapitulating the sympathoadrenal differentiation process in vitro with purified and defined populations in four specific differentiation stages. We performed transcriptome analysis of OCT4::eGFP+ cells (3 biological replicates, representing undifferentiated hESCs), SOX10::eGFP+ cells (3 biological replicates, multi-potent neural crest), ASCL1::eGFP+ cells (3 biological replicates, putative sympathoadrenal progenitors), and PHOX2B::eGFP+ cells (2 biological replicates, putative sympathetic neuronal precursors).",

Nutrigenomics analysis was used to investigate the molecular responses to dietary Cu deficiency independently and in combination with 30% (w/w) sucrose in a mature rat model of NAFLD. Low Cu significantly decreased hepatic and serum Cu, and induced NAFLD-like histopathology, mild steatosis, up-regulated transcripts in inflammation and hepatic stellate cell activation, and significantly increased oxidative stress. Rats fed low Cu together with 30% sucrose also developed insulin resistance, increased ATP citrate lyase and FASN expression, and greater oxidative stress. High sucrose with adequate Cu also promoted inflammation and fibrosis, but not steatosis. This study indicates that low dietary Cu and sucrose consumption are singular and synergistic dietary factors in promotion of NAFLD and NASH that act independently of obesity or severe steatosis, likely by promoting oxidative stress and activation of inflammation and fibrosis. Mature (6 months old) male Wistar Rats that had been allowed ad libitum access to Mazuri rodent pellets were used in the study. Twenty-four rats were divided into four groups and fed for 12 weeks with diets based on the Purified AIN76A formulation, modified for target sucrose and Cu content (Custom Animal Diets, Bangor, NJ).

Inhibitors of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) are currently used to treat advanced metastatic breast cancer. However, whether an aggressive phenotype is sustained through adaptation or resistance to mTOR inhibition remains unknown. Here, complementary studies in human tumors, cancer models and cell lines reveal transcriptional reprogramming that supports metastasis in response to mTOR inhibition. This cancer feature is driven by EVI1 and SOX9. EVI1 functionally cooperates with and positively regulates SOX9, and promotes the transcriptional upregulation of key mTOR pathway components (REHB and RAPTOR) and of lung metastasis mediators (FSCN1 and SPARC). The expression of EVI1 and SOX9 is associated with stem cell-like and metastasis signatures, and their depletion impairs the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells. These results establish the mechanistic link between resistance to mTOR inhibition and cancer metastatic potential, thus enhancing our understanding of mTOR targeting failure. A metastatic triple-negative BRCA1-mutated (germline) breast tumor orthotopically engrafted in nude mice was treated with sirolimus (5 mg/kg) or DMSO (control) for approximately 60 days.

Immunohistochemical staining of mice and human brain slices showed DAM with intracellular/phagocytic Ab particles. Single cell analysis of DAM in Tg-AD and Trem2-/- Tg-AD revealed that the DAM program is activated in a two-step process.

Thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been discovered, yet the function of the vast majority remains unclear. Here, we show that a p53-regulated lncRNA which we named PINCR (p53-induced noncoding RNA), is induced ~100-fold after DNA damage and exerts a critical prosurvival function in colorectal cancer cells (CRC) in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Targeted deletion of PINCR in CRC cells significantly impaired G1 arrest and induced hypersensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. PINCR regulates the induction of a subset of p53 targets involved in G1 arrest and apoptosis, including BTG2, RRM2B and GPX1. Using a novel RNA pulldown approach that utilized endogenous S1-tagged PINCR, we show that PINCR associates with the promoters of these genes by binding to RNA-binding protein Matrin 3 that, in turn, associates with p53. Our findings uncover a critical prosurvival function of a p53/PINCR/Matrin 3 axis in response to DNA damage in CRC cells.

Systemic arginine restriction improved outcome in multiple murine arthritis models and its removal induced preosteoclast metabolic quiescence, associated with impaired tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle function and metabolite induction. Effects of arginine deprivation on osteoclastogenesis were independent of mTORC1 activity or global transcriptional and translational inhibition. Arginine scarcity also dampened generation of IL-4 induced polykaryons, another form of MGCs. Strikingly, in the absence of extracellular arginine, both cell types displayed flexibility as their formation could be restored with select arginine precursors.

Our goal was to elucidate a mechanism of tumor proliferation and metastasis using a novel murine model of EMT.Methods: 2x106 liver cells isolated from Ptenloxp/loxp;Alb-Cre+ mice, expanded from a single CD133+CD45- cell clone, Passage 0 (P0), were sequentially transplanted to obtain two passages of tumor cells, Passage 1 and 2 (P1 & P2) . Cells were analyzed for gene expression using microarray and real-time PCR. Functional analysis included cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in-vitro and orthotopic tumor growth and metastasis assays in-vivo.Results: Although P0, P1, and P2 each formed tumors consistent with mixed liver epithelium, within the P2 cells, two distinct cell types were clearly visible: cells with epithelial morphology similar to the P0 cells, and cells with fibroblastoid morphology. The P2 mesenchymal cells demonstrated increased locomotion on wound healing, increased cell invasion on Matrigel basement membrane, increased EMT associated gene Snail1, Zeb1, and Zeb2 expression, and down-regulated E-cadherin. P2 mesenchymal cells demonstrated significantly faster tumor growth compared to P2 Epithelial counterparts, with peritoneal seeding and invasion of intestine, pancreas, spleen, and lymph nodes. Furthermore, P2 mesenchymal cells secreted high levels of Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF), which acted in paracrine fashion to drive epithelial cells to undergo EMT.Conclusion: EMT is associated with a high rate of liver tumor proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in-vivo, which is driven by HGF in a feed-forward mechanism. Total RNA isolated from subcutaneously transplanted tumors with PTENloxp/loxp;Alb-Cre+ genetic background.",

The regulation of gene expression in cells, including by microRNAs (miRNAs), is a dynamic process. Current methods for identifying microRNA targets by combining sequence, miRNA and mRNA expression data do not adequately utilize the temporal information and thus miss important miRNAs and their targets. We developed a new method, mirDREM, that uses probabilistic modeling to reconstruct dynamic regulatory networks which explain how temporal gene expression is jointly regulated by microRNAs and transcription factors (TFs). We used mirDREM to study the regulation of postnatal lung development in mice. The reconstructed network for this process identified several known miRNAs and TFs and provided novel predictions about additional miRNAs and the specific developmental phases they regulate. Microarray data of Mouse Lung Epithelial cells MLE-12 after transfection with inhibitors for miR-30a, miR-30d, miR-23b and miR-125 and with precursors for miR-337, miR-466a, miR466d and miR-476c. The results provide a general insight into the gene expression profile which was modulated by the inhibition or overexpression of these microRNAs. We experimentally validated several predictions and show that miR-30d, miR-30a, and miR-467c are new regulators of proliferation in lung cells. Our analysis establishes new links between identified miRNAs and lung diseases, supporting recent evidence that such diseases may represent reversal of lung differentiation.

Here, we identify subpopulations of human TRM in mucosal and lymphoid sites based on differential efflux of mitochondrial dyes, with distinct transcriptional profiles, turnover, and functional capacities. TRM are enriched in efflux(+) populations compared with circulating memory CD8+T cells. Compared to efflux- TRM, efflux(+) TRM showed transcriptional and phenotypic features of quiescence including reduced turnover, decreased expression of exhaustion markers, and increased proliferative capacity and signaling to homeostatic cytokines. Moreover, efflux(+) and efflux(-) TRM subsets both maintain TRM characteristics when activated, while efflux(+) TRM produce IL-17 and efflux(-) produce higher levels of IFN-g and IL-2.

Trained immunity and immune tolerance have been identified as long-term response patterns of the innate immune system. The causes of these opposing reactions remain elusive. Here we report about differential inflammatory responses of microglial cells derived from neonatal mouse brain to increasing doses of the endotoxin LPS. Prolonged priming with ultra-low LPS doses provokes trained immunity, i.e. increased production of pro-inflammatory mediators in comparison to the unprimed control. In contrast, priming with high doses of LPS induces immune tolerance implying decreased production of inflammatory mediators and pronounced release of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Investigation of the signaling processes and cell functions involved in these memory-like immune responses reveals essential role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase g (PI3Kg), one of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase species highly expressed in innate immune cells. Together, our data suggest profound influence of preceding contacts with pathogens on the immune response of microglia. The impact of these interactions - trained immunity or immune tolerance - appears to be shaped by pathogen dose.

Targeted molecular therapy has yielded remarkable outcomes in certain cancers, but specific therapeutic targets remain elusive for many others. As a result of two independent RNA interference (RNAi) screens, we identified pathway dependence on a member of the JAK tyrosine kinase family, TYK2, and its downstream effector STAT1 in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Gene knockdown experiments consistently demonstrated TYK2 dependence in both T-ALL primary specimens and cell lines, and a small-molecule inhibitor of JAK kinase activity induced T-ALL cell death. Activation of this TYK2-STAT1 pathway in T-ALL cell lines occurs by gain-of-function TYK2 mutations or activation of IL-10 receptor signaling, and this pathway mediates T-ALL cell survival through upregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2. These findings indicate that in many T-ALL cases, the leukemic cells are dependent upon the TYK2-STAT1-BCL2 pathway for continued survival, supporting the development of molecular therapies targeting TYK2 and other components of this pathway.

Exposure to serious or traumatic events early in life can lead to persistent alterations in physiological stress response systems, including enhanced cross-talk between the neuroendocrine and immune system. These programming effects may be mechanistically involved in mediating the effects of adverse childhood experience on disease risk in adulthood. Here, we investigated neuroendocrine as well as genome-wide mRNA expression responses in monocytes to acute stress exposure, in a sample of healthy adults (n=30) with a history of early childhood adversity, and a control group (n=30) without trauma experience. The early adversity group showed altered hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses to stress, evidenced by lower ACTH and cortisol responses. Analyses of gene expression patterns showed a larger stress-induced increase of cardinal pro-inflammatory transcripts IL6 and FOSB, and an increased activity of pro-inflammatory upstream signaling in the early adversity group. We also identified transcripts that were differentially correlated with stress-induced cortisol increases between the groups. Noteworthy, FKBP5 expression was less responsive to cortisol induction in the early adversity group, with potential effects on the ultra-short feedback loop that balances FKBP5 and glucocorticoid receptor activity. Further exploratory analyses showed differential stress-induced regulation of gene transcription between the groups. Prominent among the differentially regulated transcripts were those coding for genes involved in signal transducer activity, G-protein coupled receptors, and several genes involved in serotonin receptor signaling. We suggest that childhood adversity leads to persistent alterations in transcriptional control of stress responsive pathways, which - when chronically or repeatedly activated - might predispose individuals to stress-related psychopathology. 180 samples were analyzed. 60 healthy adults (30 with history of childhood adversiy, 30 controls without trauma history) were subjected to a standardized laboratory stress protocol.

Diet-induced obesity is characterized by macrophage (MPh) infiltration and low-grade chronic inflammation in white adipose tissue (WAT) leading to insulin resistance. WAT MPh are highly heterogeneous in their origin, patterns of gene expression and activities: unlike infiltrating monocyte-derived MPh that promote inflammation and metabolic dysfunction, tissue-resident WAT MPh originally described as 'M2' are phenotypically anti-inflammatory and counteract obesity and insulin resistance. Despite the critical role of the balance between these MPh populations in metabolic homeostasis, the molecular mechanisms and key players that establish the resident MPh transcription program are poorly understood. We recently reported that glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-interacting protein (GRIP)1 - a nuclear receptor coactivator - cooperates with GR to repress transcription of inflammatory genes. Here, using mice conditionally lacking GRIP1 in MPh (cKO), we show that GRIP1 promotes MPh polarization in response to IL4 (M2(IL4)) via a nuclear receptor-independent pathway by serving as a coactivator for Kruppel-like factor (KLF)4 - a critical driver of tissue MPh differentiation. Interestingly, in vivo, GRIP1 cKO mice challenged with high-fat diet develop massive MPh infiltration and chronic inflammation in WAT and liver, fatty livers, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and glucose intolerance consistent with metabolic syndrome phenotype. Together, our findings identify GRIP1 as a critical regulator of immunometabolism, which relies on distinct transcriptional mechanisms to coordinate the balance between MPh populations in vivo thereby protecting mice from obesity-induced metabolic disease. 1.

Mutations affecting spliceosomal proteins are frequently found in hematological malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. DDX41/Abstrakt is a metazoan-specific spliceosomal DEAD-box RNA helicase found to be recurrently mutated in inherited myelodysplastic syndromes and in relapsing cases of acute myeloid leukemia. The genetic properties and genomic impacts of disease-causing missense mutations in DDX41 and other spliceosomal proteins have been uncertain. Here we conduct a comprehensive molecular genetic analysis of the C. elegans DDX41 ortholog, SACY-1. Our results reveal general essential functions for SACY-1 in both the germline and the soma, as well as specific functions affecting germline sex determination and cell cycle control. Certain sacy-1/DDX41 mutations, including the R525H human oncogenic variant, confer antimorphic activity, suggesting that they compromise the function of the spliceosome. Consistent with these findings, sacy-1 exhibits synthetic lethal interactions with several spliceosomal components, and biochemical analyses suggest that SACY-1 is a component of the C. elegans spliceosome. We used the auxin-inducible degradation system to analyze the impact of SACY-1 on the transcriptome using RNA sequencing. SACY-1 depletion impacts the transcriptome through splicing-independent and splicing-dependent mechanisms. The observed transcriptome changes suggest that disruption of spliceosomal function induces a stress response. Altered 3' splice site usage represents the predominant splicing defect observed upon SACY-1 depletion, consistent with a role for SACY-1 as a second-step splicing factor. Missplicing events appear more prevalent in the soma than the germline, suggesting that surveillance mechanisms protect the germline from aberrant splicing.

Transcriptome sequencing revealed numerous novel long non-coding (lnc)RNAs and uncharacterized protein-coding transcripts identifying the signature of neurogenic commitment. Importantly, most lncRNAs overlapped neurogenic genes and shared with them a nearly identical expression pattern suggesting that lncRNAs control corticogenesis by tuning the expression of nearby cell fate determinants. We assessed the power of our approach by manipulating lncRNAs and protein-coding transcripts with no function in corticogenesis reported to date. This led to several evident phenotypes in neurogenic commitment and neuronal survival indicating that our study provides a remarkably high number of uncharacterized transcripts with hitherto unsuspected roles in brain development.

Study 1: Transcriptomic profiles in colon tissue from inflammatory bowel diseases patients in relation to N-nitroso compound exposure and colorectal cancer riskStudy 1: N-nitroso compounds (NOC) have been suggested to play a role in human cancer development but definitive evidence is still lacking. In this study we investigated gene expression modifications induced in human colon tissue in relation to NOC exposure to gain insight in the relevance of these compounds in human colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Since there are indications that inflammation stimulates endogenous NOC formation, the study population consisted of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome patients as controls without inflammation. Strong transcriptomic differences were identified in colonic biopsies from IBD patients and compared to controls that enhance the understanding of IBD pathophysiology. However, fecal NOC levels were not increased in IBD patients, suggesting that inflammation did not stimulate NOC formation. By relating gene expression changes of all subjects to fecal NOC levels, we did, however, identify a NOC exposure-associated transcriptomic response that suggests that physiological NOC concentrations may induce genotoxic responses and chromatin modifications in human colon tissue, both of which are linked to carcinogenicity. In a network analysis, chromatin modifications were linked to 11 significantly modulated histone genes, pointing towards a possible epigenetic mechanism that may be relevant in comprehending the molecular basis of NOC-induced carcinogenesis. We conclude that NOC exposure is associated with gene expression modifications in the colon that may increase CRC risk in humans.Study 2: Red meat intake-induced increases in fecal water genotoxicity correlate with pro-carcinogenic gene expression changes in the human colonStudy 2: Red meat consumption is associated with an increased colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, which may be due to an increased endogenous formation of genotoxic N-nitroso compounds (NOCs). To assess the impact of red meat intake on potential risk factors of CRC, we investigated the effect of a 7-day dietary red meat intervention in human subjects on endogenous NOC formation and fecal water genotoxicity in relation to transcriptomic changes induced in colonic tissue. In order to evaluate the potential effect of an inflamed colon on endogenous nitrosation, the study population consisted of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) control subjects without inflammation. The intervention had no effect on fecal NOC formation but fecal water genotoxicity significantly increased in response to red meat intake. Since IBD patients showed no difference in fecal NOC formation or fecal water genotoxicity levels as compared to IBS controls, for transcriptomic analyses, all subjects were grouped together. Genes significantly correlating with the increase in fecal water genotoxicity were involved in biological pathways indicative of genotoxic effects, including modifications in DNA damage, cell cycle, and apoptosis pathways. Moreover, WNT signaling and nucleosome remodeling pathways were modulated that are known to play a part in the carcinogenic process in the human colon. These results are in line with a possible oxidative effect of dietary heme. We conclude that the gene expression changes identified in this study corroborate the genotoxic potential of diets high in red meat and point towards a possible risk of CRC development in humans. The study investigated transcription levels in human colon biopsies obtained during a colonoscopic exam in 32 subjects suffering from either inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS patients served as control patients for comparison with IBD patients (see Study 1). 12 of these patients (6 IBD and 6 IBS) also followed a 7-day diet high in red meat (300 grams/day) after which a second colonscopic exam was performed to obtain colon biopsies to investigate the effect of the red meat intervention (Study 2).

Of note, this phenotype is blunted in conventional NOD2KO mice. By contrast, lean microbiota transplantation did not affect hepatic gluconeogenesis. In addition, obese microbiota transplantation changed both gut microbiota and microbiome of recipient mice.

    "text": "Comparative Transcriptomic Profiling of Antimicrobial Resistant and Virulent Escherichia coli of Poultry Origin. To characterize the differentially expressed genes between pathogenic avian E. coli and human E. coli ATCC 25922, Abstract Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a harmless common bacterium of poultry intestine, but with a wide range of genomic flexibility, is also causative agent of many poultry diseases collectively called colibacillosis that is blamed for high economic loss in poultry sector worldwide. Numerous studies have been conducted to check the prevalence of pathogenic E. coli in poultry and poultry products, however limited data are available regarding their resistance and virulence associated genes expression profile. This study examined the pathogenomic content of poultry E. coli by antibiotic susceptibility, biofilm formation and adhesion, invasion and intracellular survivability assays in Caco-2 and Raw 264.7 cell lines along with the determination of median lethal dose in two-day old chickens. A clinical pathogenic multidrug resistant (MDR) isolate, E. coli 381, isolated from broilers was found to be highly virulent in cell culture and in chicken model. Transcriptome analysis has been skewed towards bacterial pathogens because of the prioritization of poultry diseases. Comparative gene expression profile of MDR E. coli 381 and the reference human strain E. coli ATCC 25922 was done using Illumina HiSeq2500 transcriptome and results were verified by RT-qPCR analyses. A number of resistant encoding genes including multidrug transporters, multidrug resistance proteins, porins and autotransporters were identified. We also noticed overexpression of very important virulent genes (fimA, fimC, fimH and fimI) encoding the type-1 fimbrial proteins, curli fimbriae genes , invasin genes, toxin-encoding genes and biofilm forming regulatory genes . In addition, many types of stress and metal homeostasis controlling genes were among up-regulated genes in E. coli 381 as compared to reference strain. GO and KEGG pathway analysis results revealed that genes controlling secondary metabolism, drug transport, adhesion and invasion proteins, and mobile genetic elements were over-expressed in E. coli 381. Several genes involved in cellular and metabolic processes such as carbohydrate metabolism were responsible for stress tolerance. Seminal description of the transcriptomic results and other unique features of E. coli 381 confirmed that it is highly virulent and MDR strain of poultry origin. This comparative study provides new avenues for further work on molecular mechanisms to prevent resistance development in bacteria and to ensure public health. We isolated E. coli from broilers having collibacillosis, RNA were extracted from poultry isolate and E. coli ATCC 25922 a reference strain, RNA-Sequencing was done for both strains and virulent and resistance DEGs characters were discussed. Each sample had 2 biological replicates.",

Despite aggressive radiotherapy and treatment with the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ), patients ultimately succumb to the disease. Although much interest has focused on highly tumorigenic GBM stem cells (GSCs), adaption of a concept from microbial research proposes that a minor population of dormant \"persister\" cells in cancer evade current therapies. To separate dormant and treatment-resistant tumor cells in human GBM tumorspheres, we have refined density gradient protocols previously used for separation of neurosphere-forming neural stem cells (NSCs). We find that a minor cell population in human GBM tumorsphere cultures and patient-derived tumor biopsies display increased cell density. These high-density GBM cells (HDGCs) display dormancy, variable expression of proposed GSC markers, and 10-100 fold higher levels of reprogramming gene expression compared to low-density GBM cells (LDGCs). Transcriptional profiling data confirmed the slow-cycling state of HDGCs. As a result, HDGCs show decreased tumorsphere formation capacity in vitro and reduced tumorigenicity in vivo. Using tumorspheres and xenografts, we demonstrated that HDGCs show increased treatment-resistance to ionizing radiation (IR) and temozolomide treatment compared to LDGCs. Similar to the NSC lineage, our data suggest that dormant HDGCs become increasingly sensitive to anti-proliferative therapies as they become activated and further differentiate. In conclusion, density gradients represents a marker-independent approach to separate dormant and treatment-resistant tumor cells in human GBMs and other solid cancers. 12 samples, no replicates, derived from 5 individual patients.",

Background: The prefrontal cortex is important in regulating sleep and mood. Diurnally regulated genes in the prefrontal cortex may be controlled by the circadian system, by the sleep-wake states, or by cellular metabolism or environmental responses. Bioinformatics analysis of these genes will provide insights into a wide-range of pathways that are involved in the pathophysiology of sleep disorders and psychiatric disorders with sleep disturbances. Results: We examined gene expression in the mouse prefrontal cortex at four time points during the 24-hour (12-hour light:12-hour dark) cycle by microarrays, and identified 3,890 transcripts corresponding to 2,927 genes with diurnally regulated expression patterns. We show that 16% of the genes identified in our study are orthologs of identified clock, clock controlled or sleep/wakefulness induced genes in the mouse liver and SCN, rat cortex and cerebellum, or Drosophila head. The diurnal expression patterns were confirmed in 16 out of 18 genes in an independent set of RNA samples. The diurnal genes fall into eight temporal categories with distinct functional attributes, as assessed by the Gene Ontology classification and by the analysis of enriched transcription factor binding sites. Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrates that ~10% of transcripts have diurnally regulated expression patterns in the mouse prefrontal cortex. Functional annotation of these genes will be important for the selection of candidate genes for behavioural mutants in the mouse and for genetic studies of disorders associated with anomalies in the sleep:wake cycle and circadian rhythms.Keywords: diurnally-regulated gene expression.

Analysis of blood samples taken throughout the acute phase of infection from mice infected with avirulent P. chabaudi AS strain or virulent CB strainThe influence of parasite genetic factors on immune responses and development of severe pathology of malaria is largely unknown. In this study, we performed genome-wide transcriptomic profiling of whole blood during blood-stage infections of two strains of the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi that differ in virulence. We identified several transcriptomic signatures associated with the virulent infection, including signatures for lung inflammation, stronger and prolonged anemia and platelet aggregation. The latter two signatures were detected prior to pathology. The anemia signature indicated deregulation of host erythropoiesis, and the lung inflammation signature was linked to increased neutrophil infiltration, more cell death and greater parasite sequestration in the lungs. This comparative whole-blood transcriptomics profiling of virulent and avirulent malaria infections shows the validity of this approach to inform severity of malarial infection and provide insight into pathogenic mechanisms.

    "text": "The multikinase inhibitor Sorafenib targets mitochondria and synergizes with glycolysis blockade for cancer cell killing. Objective: identify novel and relevant aspects of Sorafenib action on liver cancer cells. We found that in rat hepatocholangiocarcinoma (LCSC-2) cells, exposure to the MEK/multikinase inhibitor sorafenib did not inhibit ERK phosphorylation nor induced appreciable cell death in the low micromolar range; instead, the drug elicited a raise of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accompanied by a severe decrease of oxygen consumption and intracellular ATP levels, all changes consistent with mitochondrial damage. Moreover, Sorafenib induced depolarization of isolated rat liver mitochondria, indicating a possible direct effect on the organelle. Microarray analysis of gene expression in sorafenib-trated cells revealed a metabolic reprogramming toward aerobic glycolysis, that likely accounts for resitance to drug toxicity in this cell line. Importantly, cytotoxicity was strongly potentiated by glucose withdrawal from the culture medium or by the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-glucose, a finding also confirmed in the highly malignant melanoma cell line B16F10. Mechanistic studies revealed that ROS are pivotal to cell killing by the Sorafenib + 2DG combination, and that a low content of intracellular oxidants is associated with resistance to the drug; instead, Thr172phosphorylation/activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), induced by Sorafenib, may exert protective effects, since cytotoxicity was enhanced by an AMPK specific inhibitor and prevented by the AMPK activator Metformin. Overall, this study identifies novel and relevant aspects of Sorafenib action on liver cancer cells, including mitochondrial damage, induction of ROS and a metabolic cell reprogramming towards \"glucose addiction\", potentially exploitable in therapy.

Dysfunction of A-to-I RNA editing can have catastrophic effects, particularly in the central nervous system. Thus, understanding how the process of RNA-editing is regulated has important implications for human health. However, at present, very little is known about the regulation of editing across tissues, and individuals. Here we present an analysis of RNA-editing patterns from 9 different tissues harvested from a single mouse. For comparison, we also analyzed data for 5 of these tissues harvested from 15 additional animals. We find that tissue specificity of editing largely reflects differential expression of substrate transcripts across tissues. We identified a surprising enrichment of editing in intronic regions of brain transcripts, that could account for previously reported higher levels of editing in brain. There exists a small but remarkable amount of editing which is tissue-specific, despite comparable expression levels of the edit site across multiple tissues. Expression levels of editing enzymes and their isoforms can explain some, but not all of this variation. Together, these data suggest a complex regulation of the RNA-editing process beyond transcript expression levels.

    "text": "Effect of histone deacetylase inhibitors on osteoblast gene expression. Background:Osteoblast differentiation requires the coordinated stepwise expression of multiple genes. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) accelerate the osteoblast differentiation process by blocking the activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs), which alter gene expression by modifying chromatin structure. We previously demonstrated that HDIs and HDAC3 shRNAs accelerate matrix mineralization and the expression of osteoblast maturation genes (e.g. alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin). Identifying other genes that are differentially regulated by HDIs might identify new pathways that contribute to osteoblast differentiation.Results:To identify other osteoblast genes that are altered early by HDIs, we incubated MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts with HDIs (trichostatin A, MS-275, or valproic acid) for 18 hours in osteogenic conditions. The promotion of osteoblast differentiation by HDIs in this experiment was confirmed by osteogenic assays. Gene expression profiles relative to vehicle-treated cells were assessed by microarray analysis with Affymetrix GeneChip 430 2.0 arrays. The regulation of several genes by HDIs in MC3T3-E1 cells and primary osteoblasts was verified by quantitative real-time PCR. Nine genes were differentially regulated by at least two-fold after exposure to each of the three HDIs and six were verified by PCR in osteoblasts. Four of the verified genes (solute carrier family 9 isoform 3 regulator 1 (Slc9a3r1), sorbitol dehydrogenase 1, a kinase anchor protein, and glutathione S-transferase alpha 4) were induced. Two genes (proteasome subunit, beta type 10 and adaptor-related protein complex AP-4 sigma 1) were suppressed. We also identified eight growth factors and growth factor receptor genes that are significantly altered by each of the HDIs, including Frizzled related proteins 1 and 4, which modulate the Wnt signaling pathway.Conclusions: This study identifies osteoblast genes that are regulated early by HDIs and indicates pathways that might promote osteoblast maturation following HDI exposure. One gene whose upregulation following HDI treatment is consistent with this notion is Slc9a3r1. Also known as NHERF1, Slc9a3r1 is required for optimal bone density. Similarly, the regulation of Wnt receptor genes indicates that this crucial pathway in osteoblast development is also affected by HDIs. These data support the hypothesis that HDIs regulate the expression of genes that promote osteoblast differentiation and maturation.Keywords: gene expression. To identify other osteoblast genes that are altered early by HDIs, we incubated MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts with HDIs (trichostatin A, MS-275, or valproic acid) or the vehicle control (DMSO) for 18 hours in osteogenic conditions.

ABSTRACT: The central nervous system is remarkably plastic in its ability to recover from trauma. We examined recovery from hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitrotriazine (RDX) induced seizures in rat through changes in transcriptional networks. Transcriptional networks from time series experiments provide a good basis for organizing and studying the dynamic behavior of biological processes. The goal of this work was to identify networks affected by chemical exposure and track changes in these networks as animals recover. We examined brain microarray data from rats exposed to 0, 1.2, 12, 24, and 47 mg RDX/kg body weight at different time points after exposure (24hr, 48hr, 7d, 14d, 28d and 90d). RESULTS A credible transcriptional network was constructed from the gene expression microarray data, which predicts the role of some key genes such as heat shock proteins, neuropeptide Y, thyrotropin-releasing hormones, growth factors, and ion channels in neurotransmission and neuroprotective mechanisms. Examination of the dynamic changes in expression within this network over time provided insight into CNS protective mechanisms from traumas. Single RDX Exposure with Various Time Points, Brain Tissue Investigation: Sprague-Dawley female rats were exposed to a single oral gavage of one of four concentrations of RDX or vehicle control with sampling periods of 24h, 48h, 7d, 14d, 28d, or 90d.

The recent identification of novel progenitor populations that contribute to the developing heart in a distinct temporal and spatial manner has fundamentally improved our understanding of cardiac development. However, little remains known about cardiac specification events prior to the establishment of the heart tube, or the mechanisms that direct atrial versus ventricular specification. We have identified a novel progenitor population that gives rise specifically to cardiovascular cells of the ventricles but not the atria, and to the epicardium of the differentiated heart. We determined that this cell population is first specified during gastrulation, when it transiently expresses Foxa2, a gene not previously implicated in cardiac development. Using chimeric mosaic analysis we further demonstrate that Foxa2 is cell-autonomously required for the development of ventricular cells. Finally, we reveal the existence of an analogous Foxa2+ cardiac mesoderm population during in vitro differentiation from embryonic stem cells and illustrate that these cells express genes relevant for heart development. Our data thus describe the first progenitor population identified as early as gastrulation that displays ventricular-specific differentiation potential. Together, these findings provide important new insights into the developmental origin of ventricular and atrial myocytes, and will lead to the establishment of new strategies for generating these cell types from pluripotent stem cells.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) leads to progressive destruction of articular structures. Despite recent progress in controlling inflammation and pain, little cartilage repair has yet been observed. This in vitro study aims to determine the role of chondrocytes in RA-related cartilage destruction and antirheumatic drug-related regenerative processes. Human chondrocytes were three-dimensionally cultured in alginate beads. To determine the RA-induced gene expression pattern, human chondrocytes were stimulated with supernatant of RA synovial fibroblasts (RASF) and normal donor synovial fibroblasts (NDSF), respectively. To examine antirheumatic drug response signatures, human chondrocytes were stimulated with supernatant of RASF that have been treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD; azathioprine, sodium aurothiomalate, chloroquine phosphate, methotrexate), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID; piroxicam, diclofenac) or steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (SAID; methylprednisolone, prednisolone). Genome-wide expression profiling with oligonucleotide microarrays was used to determine differentially expressed genes. Real-time RT-PCR and ELISA were performed for validation of microarray data. Following antirheumatic treatment, microarray analysis disclosed a reverted expression of 94 RA-induced chondrocyte genes involved in inflammation/NF-kB signalling, cytokine/chemokine activity, immune response, proliferation/differentiation and matrix remodelling. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that treatment of RASF with the DMARD azathioprine, gold sodium thiomalate and methotrexate resulted in chondrocyte gene expression signatures that were closely related to the \"healthy\" pattern. Treatment with the SAID methylprednisolone and prednisolone strongly reverted the RA-related chondrocyte gene expression, in particular the expression of genes involved in inflammation/NF-kB and cytokine/chemokine activity. The NSAID piroxicam and diclofenac and the DMARD chloroquine phosphate had only moderate to marginal effects. Pathway analysis determined major mechanisms of drug action, for example pathways of cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, TGF-b/TLR/Jak-STAT signalling and ECM-receptor interaction were targeted. This in vitro study provides a comprehensive molecular insight into the antirheumatic drug response signatures in human chondrocytes, thereby revealing potential molecular targets, pathways and mechanisms of drug action involved in chondrocyte regeneration. Thus, the present study may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic chondro-protective compounds and strategies.Keywords: drug response.

In B cells, LMO2 is specifically up-regulated in the Germinal Center (GC) reaction and is expressed in GC-derived non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. LMO2 is one of the most powerful prognostic indicators in DLBCL patients. However, its function in GC B cells and DLBCL is currently unknown. In the present study we characterized the LMO2 transcriptome and interactome in DLBCL cells. LMO2 regulates genes implicated in kinetochore function, chromosome assembly and mitosis. Overexpression of LMO2 in DLBCL cell lines results in centrosome amplification. In DLBCL, the LMO2 complex contains some of the traditional partners such as LDB1, E2A, HEB, Lyl1, ETO2 and SP1, but not TAL1 or GATA proteins. Furthermore, we identified novel LMO2 interacting partners: ELK1, NFATc1 and LEF-1 proteins. Reporter assays revealed that LMO2 increases transcriptional activity of NFATc1 and decreases transcriptional activity of LEF-1 proteins. Overall, our studies identified a novel LMO2 transcriptome and interactome in DLBCL and provide a platform for future elucidation of LMO2 function in GC B-cells and DLBCL pathogenesis.

Metastasis is the key determinant of poor prognosis for advanced-stage NSCLC patients. Although an important contributor to metastasis is cross-talk between tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor cells, its regulation is not fully understood. Expressed primarily in macrophages, scavenger receptor A1 (SR-A1) has been associated with lung tumorigenesis. Here, the mechanistic basis for the involvement of SR-A1 in lung cancer prognosis was investigated using population genetics, transcriptomics, and functional analyses. SR-A1 genetic variants were investigated for possible association with survival of advanced-stage NSCLC patients in the Harvard Lung Cancer Study cohort. Two SNPs (rs17484273, rs1484751) in SR-A1 were significantly associated with poor overall survival of NSCLC patients. Further, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas showed a considerable down-regulation of SR-A1 in lung tumor tissues. The association of SR-A1 with prognosis was validated in animal models in the context of lung cancer metastasis. Macrophages derived from SR-A1 knockout mice accelerated metastasis in a lung cancer mouse model. On the other hand, tumor cell seeding, migration, and invasion as well as macrophage accumulation in lung cancer tissue were enhanced in SR-A1 knockout mice. Furthermore, SR-A1 deficiency promoted up-regulation of serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) in macrophages, which appeared to be mediated by MAPK/Ikappa-B/NF-kappaB signaling. Further, SAA1 exposure promoted tumor cell invasion and macrophage migration in vitro and in vivo, but these effects were blocked by administration of an anti-SAA1 antibody. These findings suggest that SR-A1 may suppress lung cancer metastasis by down-regulating SAA1 production in macrophages. In the experimental metastasis model, 3 x 105 LLC cells were re-suspended in 200 uL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and injected into the tail vein of 8-week-old WT and SR-A1 KO female mice (B6.Cg-Msr1tm1Csk/J) to induce the pulmonary metastasis. Mice were euthanized after three weeks and the lungs were collected for analysis. Total RNA was extracted, purified, and assessed by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis and quantitated spectrophotometrically. cDNA labeled with a fluorescent dye (Cy3-dCTP) was produced by Eberwine's linear RNA amplification method and subsequent enzymatic reaction.

Silencing of FMR1 and loss of its gene product FMRP results in Fragile X Syndrome. FMRP binds brain mRNAs and inhibits polypeptide elongation. Using ribosome profiling of the hippocampus, we find that ribosome footprint levels in Fmr1-deficient tissue mostly reflect changes in RNA abundance. Profiling over a time course of ribosome runoff in wildtype tissue reveals a wide range of ribosome translocation rates; on many mRNAs, the ribosomes are stalled. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of hippocampal slices after ribosome runoff reveals that FMRP co-sediments with stalled ribosomes; and its loss results in decline of ribosome stalling on specific mRNAs. One such mRNA encodes SETD2, a lysine methyltransferase that catalyzes H3K36me3. ChIP-Seq demonstrates that loss of FMRP alters the deployment of this epigenetic mark on chromatin. H3K36me3 is associated with alternative pre-RNA processing, which we find occurs in an FMRP-dependent manner on transcripts linked to neural function and autism spectrum disorders.

    "text": "SCAF4 and SCAF8, Transcriptional Anti-Terminator Proteins (mNET-Seq). Accurate regulation of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) transcriptional termination is a prerequisite for correct gene expression. Here we describe a role for SCAF4 and SCAF8 as anti-terminators, suppressing the use of early, alternative polyadenylation sites (PASs). The SCAF4/8 proteins bind the hyper-phosphorylated RNAPII C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) modified on both Ser2 and Ser5, and are detected at early, alternative PASs. Concomitant knockout of human SCAF4 and SCAF8 results in altered PAS selection, leading to expression of truncated mRNAs and proteins lacking functional domains, and is cell-lethal. While SCAF4 and SCAF8 thus work redundantly to suppress early termination, they also have independent, non-essential functions. SCAF8 is a positive RNAPII elongation factor, whereas SCAF4 is required for correct termination at canonical transcription termination sites in the presence of SCAF8. Together, SCAF4 and SCAF8 coordinate the transition between elongation and termination, directing PAS selection to ensure correct RNAPII transcriptional termination in human cells. To study the function of SCAF4 and SCAF8 in human cells, we used CRISPR-Cas9 nickase technology to generate single and double knockouts (KOs) in HEK293 Flp-In TREX cells, which also contained a single copy of a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible SCAF4 or SCAF8 rescue construct, with the encoded GFP-tagged protein expressed at near-normal levels. All cell lines were maintained in the presence of Dox to ensure expression of the CRISPR-resistant rescue gene during and after KO cell line generation. Expression of the rescue protein reaches undetectable levels after 5 days growth in Dox-free media, resulting in effective single of double KOs. Due to the manner in which these cell lines were generated, a total of 12 cell types (6 different cell lines grown with or without Dox) were often analysed together. For example, SCAF4 SCAF8 double KOs were generated either by first knocking out SCAF4 and then SCAF8, or vice versa, and these different cell lines were in turn also derived from cell lines containing either a Dox-inducible SCAF4- or a SCAF8 rescue gene, giving rise to a total of 4 genotypically identical SCAF4 SCAF8 dKO cell lines. Moreover, a SCAF4 SCAF8 double KO that expresses a rescue gene (i.e. grown in the presence of doxycycline) is effectively a single KO; for example, a SCAF4 SCAF8 double KO expressing the SCAF4 rescue gene is genotypically and phenotypically a single SCAF8 KO cell line. For PAR-CLIP experiments, HEK293 Flp-In TREX cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged SCAF4 or SCAF8 were used for FLAG immunoprecipitations from RNA-protein crosslinked extracts.",

Our present study reveals significant decelerating effects on senescence processes in middle-aged SAMP1 mice supplemented for 6 or 14 months with the reduced form (QH2, 500 mg/ kg BW/ day) of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). To unravel molecular mechanisms of these CoQ10 effects, a genome-wide transcript profiling in liver, heart, brain and kidney of SAMP1 mice supplemented with the reduced (QH2) or oxidized form of CoQ10 (Q10) was performed. Liver seems to be the main target tissue of CoQ10 intervention, followed by kidney, heart and brain. Stringent evaluation of the resulting data revealed that QH2 has a stronger impact on gene expression than Q10, which was primarily due to differences in the bioavailability. Indeed, we found that QH2 supplementation was more effective than Q10 to increase levels of CoQ10 in the liver of SAMP1 mice (54.92-fold and 30.36-fold, respectively). To identify functional and regulatory connections of the \"top 50\" (p < 0.05) up- and down-regulated QH2-sensitive transcripts in liver (fold changes ranging from 21.24 to -6.12), text mining analysis (Genomatix BiblioSphere, GFG level B3) was used. Hereby, we identified 11 QH2-sensitive genes which are regulated by PPAR-a and are primarily involved in cholesterol synthesis (e.g. HMGCS1, HMGCL, HMGCR), fat assimilation (FABP5), lipoprotein metabolism (PLTP) and inflammation (STAT-1). Thus, we provide evidence that QH2 is involved in the reduction of fat and cholesterol synthesis via modulation of the PPAR-a signalling pathway. These data may explain, at least in part, the observed effects on decelerated age-dependent degeneration processes in QH2-supplemented SAMP1 mice. Whole genome expression profiles were analysed from liver, heart, brain and kidney (each analyzed separately) of SAMP1 mice supplemented with QH2, Q10 or a control diet.

Tumor-stromal communication within the microenvironment contributes to initiation of metastasis and may present a therapeutic opportunity. Using serial single cell RNA-sequencing in an orthotopic mouse prostate cancer model, we find upregulation of Prolactin receptor as cancer cells that have disseminated to the lung expand into micrometastases. Secretion of the ligand Prolactin by adjacent lung stromal cells is induced by tumor cell production of the COX-2 synthetic product prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2). PGE-2 treatment of fibroblasts activates the nuclear orphan receptor NR4A (Nur77), with Prolactin as a major transcriptional target for the NR4A-Retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer. Ectopic expression of Prolactin receptor in mouse cancer cells enhances micrometastasis, while treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor Celecoxib abrogates Prolactin secretion by fibroblasts and reduces tumor initiation. Across multiple human cancers, COX-2, Prolactin, and Prolactin receptor show consistent differential expression in tumor and stromal compartments. Such paracrine crosstalk may thus contribute to the documented efficacy of COX-2 inhibitors in cancer suppression.

Although neuron subtypes differ in their plasticity response, most activity-dependent transcription factors are broadly expressed across different neuron subtypes and brain regions. Thus, how regional and neuronal subtype-specific plasticity are established on the transcriptional level remains poorly understood.Here, we report that the developmental transcription factor Sox11 is induced in mature neurons upon hippocampal circuit activity and that this activity-dependent expression occurs exclusively in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. In addition, we show that Sox11 can modify synaptic plasticity and intrinsic excitability of DG granule cell neurons as well as the expression of plasticity-related genes. We propose that Sox11 is a DG-specific activity-dependent gene and might play a role in fine tuning regional plasticity in the hippocampal circuit. mRNA expression levels in dentate gyrus tissue from 10 mice were compared: In the 5 mice of the treatment group, the gyrus was transduced with Sox11-containing adeno-associated virus (AAV); the other 5, forming the control group, were transduced with AAV containing GFP.",

The development of the mammalian cerebral cortex depends on careful orchestration of proliferation, maturation, and migration events, ultimately giving rise to a wide variety of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. To better understand cellular and molecular processes that unfold during late corticogenesis, we perform single-cell RNA-seq on the mouse cerebral cortex at a progenitor driven phase (embryonic day 14.5) and at birth--after neurons from all six cortical layers are born. We identify numerous classes of neurons, progenitors, and glia, their proliferative, migratory, and activation states, and their relatedness within and across age. Using the cell-type-specific expression patterns of genes mutated in neurological and psychiatric diseases, we identify putative disease subtypes that associate with clinical phenotypes.

Cells adapt to environmental changes, including fluctuations in oxygen levels, through the induction of specific gene expression programs. To identify genes regulated by hypoxia at the transcriptional level, we pulse-labeled HUVEC cells with 4-thiouridine and sequenced nascent transcripts. Then, we searched genome-wide binding profiles from the ENCODE project for factors that correlated with changes in transcription and identified binding of several components of the Sin3A co-repressor complex, including SIN3A, SAP30 and HDAC1/2, proximal to genes repressed by hypoxia. SIN3A interference revealed that it participates in the downregulation of 75% of the hypoxia-repressed genes in endothelial cells. Unexpectedly, it also blunted the induction of 47% of the upregulated genes, suggesting a role for this corepressor in gene induction. In agreement, ChIP-seq experiments showed that SIN3A preferentially localizes to the promoter region of actively transcribed genes and that SIN3A signal was enriched in hypoxia-repressed genes, prior exposure to the stimulus. Importantly, SINA3 occupancy was not altered by hypoxia in spite of changes in H3K27ac signal. In summary, our results reveal a prominent role for SIN3A in the transcriptional response to hypoxia and suggest a model where modulation of the associated histone deacetylase activity, rather than its recruitment, determines the transcriptional output. Exponentially growing non-synchronized HUVEC were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia (21% or 1% oxygen respectively) for 8 hours and pulse-labelled with 4-thiouridine during the last two hours of treatment.

The purpose of the dataset is to analyze expression of genes induced by KRASThe proto-oncogene KRAS is mutated in a wide array of human cancers, most of which are aggressive and respond poorly to standard therapies. Although the identification of specific oncogenes has led to the development of clinically effective, molecularly targeted therapies in some cases, KRAS has remained refractory to this approach. An alternative strategy for targeting KRAS is to identify gene products that, when suppressed or inhibited, result in cell death only in the presence of an oncogenic allele. Here we have used systematic RNA interference (RNAi) to detect synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic KRAS and found that the non-canonical IkB kinase, TBK1, was selectively essential in cells that harbor mutant KRAS. Suppression of TBK1 induced apoptosis specifically in human cancer cell lines that depend on oncogenic KRAS expression. In these cells, TBK1 activated NF- B anti-apoptotic signals involving cREL and BCL-XL that were essential for survival, providing mechanistic insights into this synthetic lethal interaction. These observations identify TBK1 as a potential therapeutic target in KRAS mutant tumors and establish a general approach for the rational identification of co-dependent pathways in cancer.

These genes were associated with movement of leukocytes were identified including a group of genes for NK cell movement (CMKLR1, CX3CR1, S1PR5, GNLY and CXCR1) which were slightly higher expressed after automated compared to manual expansion. Nevertheless, the expansion profiles of NK cells after automated or manual expansion were rather similar in comparison to the remarkable difference between primary and expanded NK cells in general represented by the vast majority of regulated genes between the analyzed sample groups. Pathway analysis revealed that most of regulated genes upon expansion were associated with cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, DNA recombination and DNA repair, regulation of apoptosis and cell survival as well as cytokine signaling. Furthermore, the expression of many NK cell relevant markers was changed upon expansion with the strongest effects on up regulation of TRAIL and FASL, inhibitory TIGIT and chemokine receptors CCR2, CCR5 and CXCR6. In addition, granzyme M was down regulated but other important effector molecules like TNFa, perforin and granzymes A, B and K were up regulated. In summary we could show that manual and automatically expanded NK cells show a similar expansion profile while the differ significantly from primary NK cells. Up regulation of many NK cell relevant markers indicate for an enhanced NK cell functionaility after ex vivo activation and expansion. 24 samples were analyzed in total. 6 biological replicates represented by cells from different donors. 4 different samples per donor: freshly isolated NK cells (d0) and NK cells expanded for 14 days under 3 different conditions: in co-culture with EBV-LCL feeder cells and 500 U/mL IL2 either cultivated manually in T75 flasks (T) or automatically using the CliniMACS Prodigy system (P); NK cells cultured with 500 U/ml IL2 without feeder cells (I).",

Melatonin and melatonin related receptors (MTR1A and MTR1B) exerted amazing analgesic effect in many acute and chronic pain experimental studies, including electrically induced pain, thermally induced pain, mechanical induction of pain and chemical induction of pain. However, the anti-nociceptive action of melatonin in NP is still controversial and unclear. In the present study, our research firstly demonstrated the expression of melatonin receptors in the DRGs, and what more interesting is that MTR1A and MTR1B have a completely different cell type location (MTR1A in the satellite cells and MTR1B in the neurons). In order to get a basic glance at the effects of melatonin and MTR1B on the DRG neurons, a microarray analysis is applied to screen the pain related different expression genes in the primary DRGs cultured neurons with treatment of 1mM melatonin, 100mM MTR1B agonist 8-M-PDOT or vehicle (1% ethanol of normal saline). Subsequent examination was performed, and the finding suggested that melatonin suppressed neuropathic pain via MTR1B dependent and independent pathways in dorsal root ganglia neurons.

Here, we show that the H3K27me3 histone demethylase UTX is an essential cell-intrinsic factor that controls an iNKT lineage specific gene expression program and epigenetic landscape in a demethylase activity dependent manner. UTX deficient iNKT cells exhibit impaired expression of iNKT signature genes due to a decrease in activation-associated H3K4me3 and an increase in repressive H3K27me3 marks within the promoters that UTX occupies. Notably, we identified JunB as a novel regulator of iNKT development that partners with UTX to establish an iNKT lineage specific gene expression program. Moreover, we demonstrate that UTX-mediated regulation of super-enhancer accessibility is a key mechanism for iNKT lineage commitment.

As early as one day after the tick bite, rickettsia could be detected in the skin. R. sibirica infection was more severe than CRT and R. raoultii. Increased levels of serum IL18, IP10, and MIG, and decreased IL2 in R. sibirica febrile patients were observed compared to CRT febrile infections. RNA-seq and IHC staining could not discriminate SFGR infected and uninfected tick-fed skin lesions. The type I interferon (IFN) response was differently expressed between R. sibirica and R. raoultii infection at the cutaneous interface. Severe rickettsiosis might be inclined to induce an increased type I IFN response on the infected skin but which were complicated by the bite of a tick eliciting immune cell infiltration. Skin biopsies were assessed for the presence of rickettsial infection by PCR and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, for transcriptomic profiles by RNA-seq.",

Objectives: We compared metabolic biomarkers in the blood and PBMC gene expression profiles among normal weight, mildly obese, and moderately obese Korean adult men. Design: Subjects were classified as normal weight (BMI, 18.5~23 kg/m2), mildly obese (BMI, 25~27.5 kg/m2), and moderately obese (BMI, 27.5~30 kg/m2). Results: High leptin, lipids (except LDL- and HDL-cholesterol), and apolipoprotein B levels and low adiponectin and HDL-cholesterol levels were present in the plasma of both mildly and moderately obese subjects. Circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a and IL-6) and markers of insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and liver damage were altered in moderately obese subjects but not mildly obese subjects. PBMC transcriptome data showed enrichment of pathways involved in energy metabolism, insulin resistance, bone metabolism, cancer, inflammation, and fibrosis in both mildly and moderately obese subjects. Signaling pathways involved in oxidative phosphorylation; triglyceride synthesis; carbohydrate metabolism; insulin, mTOR, FOXO, RAP1, RAS, and TGF-b signaling; and ECM-receptor interaction were enriched only in moderately obese subjects, indicating that changes in PBMC gene expression profiles according to metabolic disturbances were associated with the development and/or aggravation of obesity. In particular, upregulation of 8 genes (FLT3LG, LTB, IL23A, CD19, CPT1B, AXIN2, CACNA1L, RPRM) and downregulation of 2 genes (CCL4L1, LPAR5) were observed only in mildly obese subjects. Six genes (CXCR5, NFKBIA, BIRC3, TNFAIP3, DDIT3, PDE4B) and 4 genes (CX3CR1, HSPA1A, CACNA2D3, APAF1) were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in both mildly and moderately obese subjects. These results suggested that these genes could be used as early or stable biomarkers for diagnosing and treating obesity-associated metabolic disturbance. Total RNA of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was obtained from normal weight (BMI, 18.5~23 kg/m2), mildly obese (BMI, 25~27.5 kg/m2) and moderately obese (BMI, 27.5~30 kg/m2) subjects and mRNA expression was measured using microarray analysis.",

The cranial neural crest cells are pluripotent cells that provide head skeletogenic mesenchyme and are crucial for craniofacial patterning. Here, we analyzed the in vivo chromatin landscapes of mouse cranial neural crest subpopulations. Early postmigratory neural crest subpopulations contributing to distinct mouse craniofacial structures displayed similar chromatin accessibility patterns, yet differed transcriptionally. Accessible promoters and enhancers of differentially silenced genes carried H3K27me3/H3K4me2 bivalent chromatin marks embedded in large Ezh2-dependent Polycomb domains, indicating transcriptional poising. These postmigratory bivalent regions were already present in neural crest premigratory progenitors. At Polycomb domains, H3K27me3 antagonized H3K4me2 deposition, which was restricted to accessible sites.

We investigated molecular changes during human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque postnatal brain development at the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome levels in two brain regions: the prefrontal cortex (PFC) that is involved in several human-specific cognitive processes, and the cerebellar cortex (CBC) that may be functionally more conserved. We find a nearly three-fold excess of human-specific gene expression changes in PFC compared to CBC. The most prominent human-specific mRNA expression pattern in the PFC is a developmental delay of approximately 5 years in the expression of genes associated with learning and memory, such as synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation. This pattern is supported by correlated changes in concentrations of proteins and the respective neurotransmitters and its magnitude is beyond the shift expected from the life-histories of the species. Mechanistically, it might be driven by change in timing of expression of four or more transcription factors. We speculate that delayed synaptic maturation in PFC may play a role in the emergence of human-specific cognitive abilities.Keywords: Age series.

The peri- and postmenopausal periods in women are associated with decreases in circulating estrogen levels, marked acceleration of age-related bone loss and increased risk of fracture. However, despite the clinical importance of postmenopausal bone loss, our molecular understanding of this process is incomplete. Here, we used co-expression network analysis to gain novel insight into the molecular mechanisms mediating bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) mice, a model of human menopause. Expression profiles from intact and OVX mice from a panel of inbred strains were used to generate a co-expression network consisting of 29 modules. Genes in network module 25 were decreased by OVX in all strains. Module 25 was enriched for genes involved in the response to oxidative stress, a process known to be an upstream causal factor for OVX-induced bone loss. It was also found that module 25 homologs were co-expressed in human bone marrow and were enriched for genes with evidence of genetic association with bone mineral density (BMD) in women. Alpha synuclein (Snca) was the most highly connected \"hub\" genes in module 25 and its in vivo knockout resulted in a 40% reduction in OVX-induced bone loss. Furthermore, protection was associated with the targeted alteration of genes in specific network modules, including module 10. Our results identify a gene module associated with OVX-induced bone loss and demonstrate that Snca regulates ovariectomy-induced bone loss by controlling bone network dynamics.

Here, we show that absence of Dicer in the adult forebrain is accompanied by a mixed neurodegenerative phenotype. While neuronal loss is observed in the hippocampus, cellular shrinkage is predominant in the cortex. Interestingly, neuronal degeneration coincides with the hyperphosphorylation of endogenous tau at several epitopes previously associated with neurofibrillary pathology. Transcriptome analysis of enzymes involved in tau phosphorylation identified ERK1 as one of the candidate kinases responsible for this event in vivo. We further demonstrate that miRNAs belonging to the miR-15 family are potent regulators of ERK1 expression in mouse neuronal cells and co-expressed with ERK1/2 in vivo. Last, we show that miR-15a is specifically downregulated in Alzheimer's disease brain. In sum, these results support the hypothesis that changes in the miRNA network may contribute to a neurodegenerative phenotype by affecting tau phosphorylation. Dicer KO vs. control.",

    "text": "Gene expression profiling of IDO-competent dendritic cells. Although much is known on the transcriptional profiles of dendritic cells (DCs) during maturation, the molecular switches critical for the acquisition of a tolerogenic program by DCs are still obscure. In the present study, we explored the gene expression pattern of CD8+ DCs purified from the mouse spleen and treated with interferon (IFN)-gamma. The cytokine, indeed, potentiates the tolerogenic potential of this DC subset via induction of the immunosuppressive tryptophan catabolism mediated by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). By comparing the expression of the IFN-gamma-modulated genes in IDO+ versus IDO- murine DCs, we found a consistent and selective association of the IDO-competent phenotype with the down-modulation of the Tyrobp gene, encoding the adapter molecule DAP12. IFN-gamma-mediated down-modulation of this gene involved IFN consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP), a transcription factor also known as IRF-8. While silencing of Tyrobp conferred IDO functional competence on IDO- DCs, silencing of Icsbp1 in IDO+ cells completely abolished IDO expression and function. In parallel, silencing of TYROBP conferred IDO competence on human IDO- DCs while silencing of IRF8 impaired IDO expression and activity in human IDO+ DCs. Therefore, the same small set of molecular switches controls IDO competence in murine and human DCs.Keywords: Time-course, treatment with agent (IFN-gamma).

    "text": "Host Age is a Systemic Regulator of Gene Expression Impacting Cancer Progression. Given that aging is the major determinant of cancer incidence, and that cancer incidence is dictated in large part by processes modulating progression of existing subclinical cancers, we demonstrate that aging may be an organizing axis for identifying cancer progression-modulating processes. This would permit the broad understanding of the aging process to directly inform the question of what changes in aggregate host signaling favor cancer progression. Exploring this idea, a syngeneic murine Lewis lung cancer model in adolescent (68 days), young adult (143 days), middle-aged (551 days), and old (736 days) C57BL/6 mice was used to identify the signaling and functional processes varying significantly with host age. As anticipated, many of these specific endpoints proved to be major determinants of cancer progression. Older hosts demonstrated decreased angiogenesis, decreased metabolism and dysregulated apoptosis, all identified as hallmarks of cancer progression. Transforming growth factor 1, downregulated in older hosts, was also identified as a central player in these systemic processes. It is concluded that the strong host-age dependence here observed for tumor advancement facilitates the identification of an overarching tumor control dynamic exerted by the host. Revealed is insight into a mechanistic basis for the role of aging on modulation of tumor progression that may be therapeutically exploitable. For genome-wide expression profiling of tumor tissue, Mouse WG-6 BeadArray chips (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were used. Total RNA was amplified with the Ambion Illumina TotalPrep Amplification Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and labeled from all replicate biological samples for each condition. For tumor replicates, 20 tumor samples from adolescent, 10 from young adult, 10 from middle-aged, and 20 from old mice, were used. All replicate samples were run individually. Total RNA was isolated and purified using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and quantified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Samples were deemed suitable for amplification and hybridization if they had 28s/18s = 2:1, RIN >7. Total RNA of 500ng per sample was amplified using AmbionTotalPrep, and 1.5ug of the product was loaded onto the chips. Following hybridization at 55C, the chips were washed and then scanned using the Illumina iScan System. The data was checked with GenomeStudio (Illumina) for quality control. Data were corrected through normalization of the housekeeping genes, quantile normalized, then imported into MultiExperiment Viewer, MeV for analysis.

Sox2 is required to maintain osteosarcoma cell tumor initiation.Knockdown of Sox2 leads tpo loss of tumorigenic properties. To examine gene expression changes upon Sox2 knockdown, we performed microarray analysis on mouse osteosarcoma cells expressing scrambled or Sox2shRNA. We found that genes upregulated upon Sox2 knockdown included osteoblast diffrentiation genes and genes down regulated included cell cycle and RNA processing genes as well as YAP-TEAD target genes.The Hippo pathway has a profound tumor suppressive role in cancer by restraining the strong growth-promoting function of YAP. We have previously shown that the stem cell transcription factor Sox2 maintains the tumorigenicity of osteosarcoma cancer stem cells (CSCs). In this report, we describe that Sox2 maintains stemness by antagonizing the Hippo pathway via direct repression of Hippo activators, Nf2 (Merlin) and WWC1 (Kibra), thereby leading to exaggerated YAP function. YAP is potently oncogenic in osteosarcoma and its depletion sharply reduces the tumorigenic CSC fraction. Low Nf2, low WWC1, and high YAP expression mark the CSC fraction of the tumor population, while the more differentiated fraction has high Nf2, high WWC1 and reduced YAP expression. This Sox2-Hippo axis is conserved and also operates in other Sox2-dependent cancers such as glioblastomas. We propose that disruption of YAP transcriptional activity reduces CSCs and could be a therapeutic strategy for Sox2- dependent tumors. Gene expression of 482 mouse lines mOS482 were analyzed by microarray. 3 replicates each of scrambled and Sox2shRNA were processed and hybridized.",

Background Published multi-gene classifiers suggested outcome prediction for patients with stage UICC II colon cancer based on different gene expression signatures. However, there is currently no translation of these classifiers for application in routine diagnostic. Therefore, we aimed at validating own and published gene expression signatures employing methods which enable RNA and protein detection in routine diagnostic specimens. Results Immunohistochemistry was applied to 68 stage UICC II colon cancers to determine the protein expression of five selected previously published classifier genes (CDH17, LAT, CA2, EMR3, and TNFRSF11A). Correlation of protein expression data with clinical outcome within a 5-year post-surgery course failed to separate patients with a disease-free follow-up [Group DF] and relapse [Group R]). In addition, RNA from macrodissected tumor samples from 53 of these 68 patients was profiled on Affymetrix GeneChips (HG-U133 Plus 2.0). Prognostic signatures were generated by Nearest Shrunken Centroids with cross-validation. Although gene expression profiling allowed the identification of differentially expressed genes between the groups DF and R, a stable classification and prognosis signature was not discernable in our data. Furthermore, the application of previously published gene signatures consisting of 22 and 19 genes, respectively, to our gene expression data set using 'global tests' and leave-one-out cross-validation was unable to predict clinical outcome (prediction rate 75.5% and 64.2%; n.s.). T-stage was the only independent prognostic factor for relapse in multivariate analysis with established clinical and pathological parameters including microsatellite status. Conclusions Our protein and gene expression analyses currently do not support application of molecular classifiers for prediction of clinical outcome in routine diagnostic as a basis for patient-orientated therapy in stage UICC II colon cancer. Further studies are needed to develop prognosis signatures applicable in patient care. 53 patients with primary stage UICC II colon cancer treated by elective standard oncological resection were selected. None of the patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with susceptibility for hereditary colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease were excluded from this study.

Endodermal stem/progenitor cells have diverse potential applications in research and regenerative medicine, so a readily available source could have widespread uses. Here we describe derivation of human induced endodermal progenitor cells (hiEndoPCs) from gastrointestinal epithelial cells using a cocktail of defined small molecules along with support from tissue-specific mesenchymal feeders. The hiEndoPCs show clonal expansion in culture and give rise to hepatocytes, pancreatic endocrine cells, and intestinal epithelial cells when treated with defined soluble molecules directing differentiation. The hiEndoPC-derived hepatocytes are able to rescue liver failure in Fah-/-Rag2-/- mice after transplantation, and, unlike hESCs, transplanted hiEndoPCs do not give rise to teratomas.

How retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells degenerate from oxidative stress in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is incompletely understood. The study's intent was to identify key cytoprotective pathways activated by oxidative stress, and to determine the extent of their protection. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify the unfolded protein response (UPR) and mitochondria in the RPE of AMD samples. Maculas with early AMD had prominent IRE1a, but minimal mitochondrial TOM20 immunolabeling in mildly degenerated RPE. RPE cells treated with cigarette smoke extract (CSE), by microarray analysis, had over-represented genes involved in the antioxidant and unfolded protein response, and mitochondrial location. CSE induced the UPR sensors IRE1a, p-PERK, and ATP6, which activated CHOP. CHOP knockdown compromised cell viability after CSE exposure. At the same CSE doses, mitochondria generated superoxide anion and produced less ATP. In mice given intravitreal CSE, the RPE had increased IRE1a and decreased ATP, which elicited RPE epithelial-mesenchymal transition, as suggested by altered ZO1 immunolabeling of RPE flatmounts. Our experiments indicate that RPE cells exposed to oxidative stress respond with a cytoprotective antioxidant and unfolded protein response, but develop mitochondrial impairment that contributed to epithelial mesenchymal transition. With similar responses in the RPE of early AMD samples, these results suggest that mitochondria are vulnerable to oxidative stress while the ER elicits a protective response during early AMD.

Here, we identified five factors (Foxg1, Sox2, Ascl1, Dlx5 and Lhx6) able to convert fibroblasts directly into induced GABAergic INs (iGABA-INs), displaying the molecular signature of telencephalic INs. The selected factors recapitulate in fibroblasts the activation of transcriptional networks required for the specification of GABAergic fate during telencephalon development. iGABA-INs exhibited progressively maturing firing patterns comparable to those of cortical INs, had synaptic currents and released GABA. Importantly, upon grafting in the hippocampus, iGABA-INs survived, matured and their optogenetic stimulation triggered GABAergic transmission and inhibited the activity of connected granule cells. The five factors also converted human cells into functional GABAergic neurons. These properties define iGABA-INs as a promising tool for disease modeling and cell-based therapeutic approaches.

One of the most common smoking-related diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), results from a dysregulated, multi-tissue inflammatory response to cigarette smoke. We hypothesized that systemic inflammatory signals in genome-wide blood gene expression can identify clinically important COPD-related disease subtypes, and we leveraged pre-existing gene interaction networks to guide unsupervised clustering of blood microarray expression data. Using network-informed non-negative matrix factorization, we analyzed genome-wide blood gene expression from 229 former smokers in the ECLIPSE Study, and we identified novel, clinically relevant molecular subtypes of COPD. These network-informed clusters were more stable and more strongly associated with measures of lung structure and function than clusters derived from a network-naive approach, and they were associated with subtype-specific enrichment for inflammatory and protein catabolic pathways. These clusters were successfully reproduced in an independent sample of 135 smokers from the COPDGene Study.Briefly, gene expression was derived from whole blood samples in ECLIPSE subjects and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for the COPDGene subjects. Gene expression profiling was performed using the Affymetrix Human U133 Plus2 array. Gene expression data were log-transformed, and background correction and normalization were performed for the merged ECLIPSE and COPDGene samples using robust multi-array averaging and quantile normalization as implemented in the affy Bioconductor package[27]. Of the 136 COPDGene subjects reported in a previous publication[13], one self-reported African-American subject was removed from analysis, which was conducted on the remaining 135 non-Hispanic white subjects. To identify a set of genes associated with COPD, we performed differential expression analysis for 38,519 probesets in ECLIPSE that passed quality control measures. Normalized probeset intensities were related to measures indicative of two primary dimensions of pulmonary impairment in COPD airway obstruction as indicated by two measures of spirometric lung function (FEV1 (% of predicted) and FEV1/FVC) and lung parenchymal destruction, i.e., emphysema (as quantified by the percentage of low attenuation area less than -950 Hounsfield units on lung computed tomography, %LAA-950). The analysis was conducted using the limma Bioconductor package, and the false discovery rate was controlled at 5%. The following covariates were included in the differential expression analysis age, pack-years of cigarette smoke exposure, and gender. After standardizing gene expression data from 229 ECLIPSE subjects by the variance of each probe set, we applied NMF[29] and NBS[6] to identify meta-patients (i.e. subtypes or subject clusters) and meta-genes (i.e. representative subtype expression profiles).Cross-sectional study of smokers. 229 subjects from the ECLIPSE study were analyzed in the model discovery phase. 135 subjects from the COPDGene Study (GSE42057) were used for replication.Please note that the entire data set for total 364 samples including the re-analyzed samples is provided in the *364samples.txt files.",

Numerous mRNAs are also differentially expressed in autoimmune disease but their regulation is also unclear. The majority of the human genome is transcribed yet its biologic significance is incompletely understood. We performed whole genome RNA-sequencing [RNA-seq] to categorize expression of mRNAs, known and novel long non-coding RNAs [lncRNAs] in leukocytes from subjects with autoimmune disease and identified annotated and novel lncRNAs differentially expressed across multiple disorders. We found that loci transcribing novel lncRNAs were not randomly distributed across the genome but co-localized with leukocyte transcriptional enhancers, especially super-enhancers, and near genetic variants associated with autoimmune disease risk. We propose that alterations in enhancer function, including lncRNA expression, produced by genetics and environment, change cellular phenotypes contributing to disease risk and pathogenesis and represent attractive therapeutic targets.

The pathophysiology of endometriotic lesion development remains unclear but involves a complex interaction between ectopic endometrium and host peritoneal tissues. We hypothesised that disruption of this interaction was likely to suppress endometriotic lesion formation. We hoped to delineate the molecular and cellular dialogue between ectopic human endometrium and peritoneal tissues in nude mice, as a first step towards testing this hypothesis. Human endometrium was xenografted into nude mice and the resulting lesions were analysed using microarrays. A novel technique was developed that unambiguously determined whether RNA transcripts identified by the microarray analyses originated from human cells (endometrium) or mouse cells (stroma). Four key pathways (ubiquitin/proteosome, inflammation, tissue remodelling/repair and ras-mediated oncogenesis) were revealed, that demonstrated communication between host stromal cells and ectopic endometrium.Morphometric analysis of nude mouse lesions confirmed that necrosis, inflammation, healing and repair and cell proliferation occurred during xenograft development. These processes were entirely consistent with the molecular networks revealed by the microarray data. The transcripts detected in the xenografts overlapped with transcripts differentially expressed in a comparison between paired eutopic and ectopic endometrium from human endometriotic patients.For the first time components of the interaction between ectopic endometrium and peritoneal stromal tissues have been revealed in ectopic endometrial lesions. Targeted disruption of this dialogue is likely to disrupt endometriotic tissue formation and may prove to be an effective therapeutic strategy for endometriosis.Keywords: time course, disease state analysis.

However, it is unclear how aging interacts with genetic predispositions to promote neurodegeneration. Here we investigate how partial loss-of-function of TBK1, a major genetic cause for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) comorbidity, leads to age-dependent neurodegeneration. We show that TBK1 is an endogenous inhibitor of RIPK1 and the embryonic lethality of Tbk1-/- mice is dependent on RIPK1 kinase activity. In aging human brains, another endogenous RIPK1 inhibitor, TAK1, exhibits a marked decrease in expression. We show that in Tbk1+/- mice, the reduced myeloid TAK1 expression promotes all the key hallmarks of ALS/FTD, including neuroinflammation, TDP-43 aggregation, axonal degeneration, neuronal loss and behavior deficits, which are blocked upon inhibition of RIPK1. Thus, aging facilitates RIPK1 activation by reducing TAK1 expression, which cooperates with genetic risk factors to promote the onset of ALS/FTD. mRNA profiles of primary microglia derived from 2-day old wild type (WT), Tbk1+/-, Tbk1+/-;Ripk1D138N/D138N, Tak1DM/+, Tbk1+/-;Tak1DM/+ and Tbk1+/-;Tak1DM/+;RIpk1D138N/+ mice were generated by bulk RNA sequencing, in triplicate.",

We also examined the SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice fed with the regular (control; low-safflower oil, LSO) diets specifically to know the gene profiles in the brain of the SAMP8 mouse. Results revealed that WME supplementation on SAMP8 mouse resulted in an increase in the level of learning memory formation and positive changes in the transcriptome of the brain, suggested through the observation of recovery of gene expressions in the SAMP8 model over the not-supplemented mouse. 6-week-old mice (SAMP8 and SAMR1; CLEA, Tokyo, Japan) were housed at the Animal Institution Facility in Showa University, and maintained in individual cages in a ventilated animal room with controlled temperature and relative humidity under a 12-h light: 12-h dark regime (8:00 AM, lights turned on). Mice were fed chow (CE-2, CLEA Japan) and tap water ad libitum until 24-weeks-old. Then, 24-week-old SAMs mice were given experimental diet, LSO diet as a control diet and WME-supplemented diet, both in a powder form. The WME was made from red meat of Antarctic minke whale (Balaenoptera bonaerensis), taken from the Japanese Whale Research Program under Special Permit in the Antarctic-Phase II in 2009/2010 by heat, enzyme and drying treatments. The quality standard of WE were measured by Marugei Co. Ltd. (Hyogo, Japan). SAMP8 mice were randomly given LSO or WME diet, respectively. SAMR1 mice were given LSO diet only until 50-weeks-old. The behavioral tests were performed at the timing of 49-weeks-old for 8 days. At the end of the experiment (50 weeks of age) following the behavioral analysis (open field test, Y-maze test, new object recognition test (NOR), and water-filled multiple T-maze) and the last day of the feeding, the mice were removed from their cages, decapitated and their brains carefully removed on ice. The whole brains were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen in a sterile freeze tube and stored at -80oC till extraction of total RNA followed by DNA microarray analysis using a whole-genome mouse chip (Agilent-014868, 4 x 44K (G4122F)) with two-color dye-swap approach in conjunction with IPA bioinformatic analysis.

Myc oncoproteins directly regulate transcription by binding to target genes, yet this only explains a fraction of the genes affected by Myc. mRNA turnover is controlled via AU-binding proteins (AUBPs) that recognize AU-rich elements (AREs) found within many transcripts. Analyses of precancerous and malignant Myc-expressing B cells revealed that Myc regulates hundreds of ARE-containing (ARED) genes and select AUBPs. Notably, Myc directly suppresses transcription of Tristetraprolin (TTP/ZFP36), an mRNA-destabilizing AUBP, and this circuit is also operational during B lymphopoiesis and IL7 signaling. Importantly, TTP suppression is a hallmark of cancers with MYC involvement, and restoring TTP impairs Myc-induced lymphomagenesis and abolishes maintenance of the malignant state. Further, there is a selection for TTP loss in malignancy; thus, TTP functions as a tumor suppressor. Finally, Myc/TTP-directed control of select cancer-associated ARED genes is disabled during lymphomagenesis. Thus, Myc targets AUBPs to regulate ARED genes that control tumorigenesis. Ex vivo Em-Myc lymphoma cells were infected with MSCV-I-dsRed2 (RFP) and FACS sorted for dsRed2+ cells. These cells were then infected with MSCV-TTP-I-GFP and FACS sorted for GFP expression (TTP-GFP- or TTP-GFP+).

Bromodomain and extra terminal protein inhibitors (BETi) are epigenetic therapies aimed to target dysregulated gene expression in cancer cells. Despite early success of BETi in a range of malignancies, the development of drug resistance may limit their clinical application. We evaluated the mechanisms of BETi resistance in uveal melanoma (UM), a disease with little treatment options, using two approaches: a high-throughput combinatorial drug screen with the clinical BET inhibitor PLX51107, and RNA sequencing of BETi-resistant cells. We found that the NF-kB inhibitors synergistically sensitized UM cells to PLX51107 treatment. Furthermore, genes involved in NF-kB signaling were upregulated in BETi-resistant cells and the transcription factor CEBPD contributed to the mechanism of resistance. These findings suggest that inhibitors of NF-kB signaling may improve the efficacy of BET inhibition in patients with advanced UM. We developed 4 BETi-resistant uveal and 1 BETi-resistant cutaneous melanoma cell lines by exposing chronically the cells to increasing doses of PLX51107(0.05-2 mM) for eight weeks. To search for mechanisms driving resistance, we compared transcriptomes of the parental and BETi-resistant cell lines under 2 conditions: either with DMSO treatment either with 0.5 mM PLX51107 for 24 hours.

Diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by fasting hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance. Laboratory and population studies have shown that inorganic arsenic (iAs) can impair these pathways. Other metals including cadmium (Cd) and manganese (Mn) have also been linked to diabetes phenotypes. MicroRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression, have emerged as potential drivers of metabolic dysfunction. MicroRNAs responsive to metal exposures in vitro have also been reported in independent studies to regulate insulin secretion in vivo. We hypothesize that microRNA dysregulation may associate with and possibly contribute to insulin secretion impairment upon exposure to iAs, Cd, or Mn. We exposed insulin secreting rat insulinoma cells to non-cytotoxic concentrations of iAs (1 uM), Cd (5 uM), and Mn (25 uM) for 24 h followed by small RNA sequencing to identify dysregulated microRNAs. RNA sequencing was then performed to further investigate changes in gene expression caused by iAs exposure. While all three metals significantly inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, high-throughput sequencing revealed distinct microRNA profiles specific to each exposure. One of the most significantly upregulated microRNAs post-iAs treatment is miR-146a (~ + 2-fold), which is known to be activated by nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) signaling. Accordingly, we found by RNA-seq analysis that genes upregulated by iAs exposure are enriched in the NF-kB signaling pathway and genes down-regulated by iAs exposure are enriched in miR-146a binding sites and are involved in regulating beta cell function. Notably, iAs exposure caused a significant decrease in the expression of Camk2a, a calcium-dependent protein kinase that regulates insulin secretion, has been implicated in type 2 diabetes, and is a likely target of miR-146a. Further studies are needed to elucidate potential interactions among NF-kB, miR-146a, and Camk2a in the context of iAs exposure.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are OnaturalO interferon _ (IFN_)-producing cells. Despite their importance to antiviral defense, autoimmunity, and ischemic liver graft injury, because DC subsets are rare and heterogeneous, basic questions about liver pDC function and capacity to make cytokines remain unanswered. Previous investigations failed to consistently detect IFN_ mRNA in HCV-infected livers, suggesting that pDCs may be incapable of producing IFN_. We used a combination of molecular, biochemical, cytometric, and high-dimensional techniques to analyze DC frequencies/functions in liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients, to examine correlations between DC function and gene expression of matched whole liver tissue and liver mononuclear cells (LMCs), and to determine if pDCs can produce multiple cytokines. T cells often produce multiple cytokines/chemokines but until recently technical limitations have precluded tests of polyfunctionality in individual pDCs. Mass cytometry (CyTOF) revealed that liver pDCs are the only LMC that produces detectable amounts of IFN_ in response TLR-7/8 stimulation. Liver pDCs secreted large quantities of IFN_ (~2 million molecules of IFN_/cell/hour) and produced more IFN_ than PBMCs after stimulation, p=0.0001. LMCs secreted >14-fold more IFN_ than IFN_ in 4 hours. Liver pDC frequency positively correlated with whole liver expression of OIFN_-responseO pathway (R2=0.58, p=0.007) and Omonocyte surfaceO signature (R2=0.54, p=0.01).

Liver BDCA1 DCs, but not BDCA3 DCs, were similarly polyfunctional. pDCs from a healthy liver were also polyfunctional. Our data show that liver pDCs retain the ability to make abundant IFN_ during chronic HCV infection and produce many other immune modulators.

X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female lymphocytes is uniquely regulated, as the inactive X (Xi) chromosome lacks localized Xist RNA and heterochromatin modifications. Epigenetic profiling reveals that Xist RNA is lost from the Xi at the pro-B cell stage and that additional heterochromatic modifications are gradually lost during B cell development. Activation of mature B cells restores Xist RNA and heterochromatin to the Xi in a dynamic two-step process that differs in timing and pattern, depending on the method of B cell stimulation. Finally, we find that DNA binding by YY1 maintains XCI in activated B cells, as ex-vivo YY1 deletion results in loss of Xi heterochromatin marks and up-regulation of X-linked genes. Ectopic expression of the YY1 zinc finger domain is sufficient for Xist RNA localization during B cell activation. Together, our results indicate that Xist RNA localization is critical for maintaining XCI in female lymphocytes, and that chromatin changes on the Xi during B cell development and the dynamic nature of YY1-dependent XCI maintenance in mature B cells predisposes X- linked immunity genes to reactivation. Follicular B cells were isolated from the spleens of six (three males and three females) C57Bl/6 yy1 fl/fl mice.

They are activated in a temporal sequence following their topological order within their genomic clusters. Subsequently, states of activity are fine-tuned and maintained to translate into domains of progressively overlapping gene products. While the mechanisms underlying such temporal and spatial progressions begin to be understood, many of their aspects remain unclear. We have systematically analyzed the 3D chromatin organization of Hox clusters in vivo, during their activation using high-resolution circular chromosome conformation capture (4C-seq). Initially, Hox clusters are organized as single 3D chromatin compartments decorated with bivalent chromatin marks. Their progressive transcriptional activation is associated with a dynamic bi-modal 3D organization, whereby the genes switch one after the other, from an inactive to an active 3D compartment. These local 3D dynamics occur within a larger constitutive framework of interactions within the surrounding Topological Associated Domains, which confirms previous results that regulation of this process in primarily cluster intrinsic.

We investigated the etiology of autosomal dominant mucocutaneous ulceration in a family whose proband was dependent on anti-TNF-a therapy for sustained remission.

Subsequently, S100A8/S100A9-activities are locally restricted by calcium-induced (S100A8/S100A9)2-tetramer formation now hiding the TLR4/MD2-binding site within the tetramer interphase thus preventing undesirable systemic effects. Loss of this auto-inhibitory mechanism in vivo results in TNFa-driven fatal inflammation as shown by lack of tetramer formation crossing S100A9-/- mice with two independent TNFa-transgene mouse strains. Since S100A8/S100A9 is the most abundant DAMP in many inflammatory diseases, specifically blocking of the TLR4-binding site of active S100-dimers represents an innovative approach for local suppression of inflammatory diseases avoiding systemic side effects. Human blood monocytes stimulated with MRP8 (S100A8) - MRP14 (S100A9) homo or hetero dimers or LPS were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Illumina microarrays.",

    "text": "Next generation sequencing identifies discrete classes of box C/D snoRNAs featuring different ends and RNA binding protein dependency. The paired-end next-generation sequencing of all small RNAs of less than 200 nucleotides in length from four different human cell lines (SKOV3ip1, MCF-7, BJ-Tielf, INOF) allowed us to determine the exact sequence(s) and variations of human box C/D snoRNAs (small nucleolar RNAs), revealing processing patterns of this class of molecules. Two distinct groups of box C/D snoRNAs were identified based on the position of their ends with respect to their characteristic boxes and the terminal base pairing potential. Short box C/D snoRNAs start sharply 4 or 5 nucleotides upstream of their box C and end 2 or 3 nucleotides downstream of their box D. In contrast, long box C/D snoRNAs start 5 or 6 nucleotides upstream of their box C and end 4 or 5 nucleotides downstream of their box D, increasing the likelihood of formation of a k-turn between their boxes C and D. Sequencing of SKOV3ip1 cells following the depletions of NOP58, a core box C/D snoRNA-binding protein and of RBFOX2, a splicing factor, shows that the short box C/D snoRNA forms are significantly more affected by the depletion of RBFOX2 while the long snoRNA forms, which display more canonical box C/D snoRNA features, are significantly more affected by the depletion of NOP58. Together the data suggest that box C/D snoRNAs are divided into at least two groups of RNA with distinct maturation and functional preferences. Small RNAs (<200 nucleotides) were isolated from different human cell lines that were either untreated or depleted of NOP58 or RBFOX2 using specific siRNAs. The resulting libraries were multiplexed and paired-end sequenced using Illumina HiSeq.",

The role of the liver for survival of blood-stage malaria is only fragmentary understood.In the experimental blood-stage malaria Plasmodium chabaudi, protective vaccination induces self-healing and, thus,survival of otherwise lethal infections. This study investigates the response of the liver, in terms of mRNA and lincRNA expression,to vaccination-induced self-healing infections and lethal P. chabaudi malaria at early patency on day 4 p.i.,when parasitized erythrocytes begin to appear in peripheral blood. Using gene expression microarrays,23 genes were identified to be induced in the liver by >10-fold at p<0.01.More than one third were genes involved in erythropoiesis, as e.g. Kel, Rhag, Ahsp, Ermap, Slc4a1, Cldn13 Gata1, and Gfi1b.Another group of >10-fold expressed genes contain genes involved in natural cytotoxicity,as those encoding the killer cell lectin-like like receptors Klrb1a, Klrc3, Klrd1, Ncr1 and the granzyme B encoding Gzmb.In addition, there were identified a series of genes involved in the control of cell cycle and mitosis,as Ccnb1, Cdc25c, Ckap2l expressed by >10-fold only in vaccination-protected mice, and 22 genes being at least 100% higher expressedin vaccination-protected mice than the corresponding genes significantly expressed in non-vaccinated mice.Furthermore, distinct lincRNA species were changed by >3-fold in livers of vaccination-protected mice,whereas lethal malaria induced different lincRNAs. Our data suggest that protective vaccination accelerates extramedullary erythropoiesis,generation of liver-resident cytotoxic cells, and regeneration from malaria-induced injuries in the liver at early patency,which may be critical for final survival of otherwise lethal blood-stage malaria of P. chabaudi.Mice:Balb/c mice breeded under specified pathogen-free conditions were delivered from central animal facilities of the University of Dusseldorf.The experiments were performed only with female mice aged 10-12 weeks.They were housed in plastic cages, received a standard diet (Woehrlin, Bad Salzuflen, Germany) and water ad libitum.This study was carried out in strict accordance with the German law on animal protection.The keeping of mice as well as the experimental protocol of the study were officially approved by the State-controlled Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the State Nordrhein-Westfalen,Germany, and were regularly controlled, without being previously announced, by the local authorities.All efforts were undertaken to minimize suffering of mice.P. chabaudi malaria infection:Blood-stage infections of P. chabaudi were kept in outbred mice under sterile conditions by weekly passages of infected blood.A non-clonal line of P. chabaudi is used in our laboratory since 1982,which resembles to P. chabaudi chabaudi.

The identification of genes and deduced pathways from the mature human oocyte can help us better understand oogenesis, folliculogenesis, fertilization, and embryonic development. Human metaphase II oocytes were used within minutes after removal from the ovary, and its transcriptome was compared with a reference sample consisting of a mixture of total RNA from 10 different normal human tissues not including the ovary. RNA amplification was performed by using a unique protocol. Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip arrays were used for hybridizations. Compared with reference samples, there were 5,331 transcripts significantly up-regulated and 7,074 transcripts significantly down-regulated in the oocyte. Of the oocyte up-regulated probe sets, 1,430 have unknown function. A core group of 66 transcripts was identified by intersecting significantly up-regulated genes of the human oocyte with those from the mouse oocyte and from human and mouse embryonic stem cells. GeneChip array results were validated using RT-PCR in a selected set of oocyte-specific genes. Within the up-regulated probe sets, the top overrepresented categories were related to RNA and protein metabolism, followed by DNA metabolism and chromatin modification. This report provides a comprehensive expression baseline of genes expressed in in vivo matured human oocytes. Further understanding of the biological role of these genes may expand our knowledge on meiotic cell cycle, fertilization, chromatin remodeling, lineage commitment, pluripotency, tissue regeneration, and morphogenesis. . We generated a database of the human oocyte transcriptome by comparing the transcripts in the oocyte with the reference samples, which contain mRNA from several somatic tissues.Human oocytes were obtained from three patients undergoing an assisted reproductive treatment (ART) at the Unit of Reproductive Medicine of Clinica Las Condes, Santiago, Chile. It is important to emphasize that the routine in vitro fertilization protocol at Clinica Las Condes calls for fertilizing only those oocytes that will be transferred into the uterus of the patient. Therefore, there is always a surplus of oocytes. We then had the opportunity to use specific criteria to select donors as follows: (i) <35 years old, (ii) reproductively healthy with regular ovulatory cycles, (iii) male factor as the only cause of infertility, and (iv) considerable number of developing follicles that assured spared oocytes. The experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by a local independent Ethics Review Board. All donors signed informed consent. At the time this manuscript was submitted, all three donors had already conceived; two of them got pregnant during the ART cycle in which our samples were collected, and the third one got pregnant after a spontaneous cycle with artificial insemination using donated sperm. Ovarian stimulation, oocyte retrieval, and cell lysis were performed as described in Supporting Materials and Methods, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site. Three groups of 10 oocytes each were used. Reference RNA (100 mg) was prepared by mixing 10 mg of total RNA from each of 10 different normal human tissues, including skeletal muscle, kidney, lung, colon, liver, spleen, breast, brain, heart, and stomach (Ambion).

We report the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with longstanding T1D (disease duration >= 50years) with severe (designated Medalist +C) or absent to mild complications (designated Medalist -C). Disease modeling of iPSCs revealed impairment in growth, reprogramming and differentiation in Medalist +C. Further investigations using genomics and proteomics analyses suggested differential regulation of DNA damage checkpoint proteins favoring protection from cellular apoptosis in Medalist -C. In silico analyses revealed altered expression patterns of DNA damage checkpoint factors among the Medalist groups to be targets of miR200, whose expression was significantly elevated in Medalist +C serum. Notably, neurons differentiated from Medalist +C iPSCs showed enhanced susceptibility to genotoxic stress that worsened upon miR200 over-expression.

Background: Blocking the action of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) reduces beta-cell secretory dysfunction and apoptosis in vitro, diabetes incidence in animal models of Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), and glycaemia via improved beta-cell function in patients with T2D. We hypothesised that anakinra, a recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist, improves beta-cell function in patients with new-onset T1D. Methods: In an individually randomised, two-group parallel trial involving 14 European tertiary referral centers, 69 patients aged 18-35 with T1D, < 12 weeks of symptoms, and standard mixed meal test (MMT) stimulated C-peptide >= 200 pM were enrolled between January, 2009 and July, 2011 and assigned by centralised computer-generated blocked randomisation with locked computer-file concealment to treatment with 100 mg anakinra (n=35) subcutaneously once daily or placebo (n=34) for 9 months as add-on to conventional therapy. Participants and care-givers, but not data monitoring unit, were masked to group assignment. The primary end-point was change in the two-hour area-under-the-curve C-peptide response to MMT, and secondary end-points changes in insulin requirements, glycaemia, and inflammatory markers at one, three, six, and nine months. Findings: The study was prematurely terminated due to slow accrual and is closed to follow-up. No interim analysis was performed. Ten patients withdrew in the anakinra and eight in the placebo arm, leaving 25 and 26 patients to be analysed, respectively. There was no statistical difference in adverse event category reporting between arms.

Considering the crucial role of Fe in many metabolic pathways e.g., DNA synthesis, it is important to understand the function of MTf. To define the roles of MTf, a MTf knockout (MTf -/-) mouse model was developed. Examination of the MTf -/- mice demonstrated no phenotypic differences compared to wild-type littermates. However, microarray analysis showed differential expression of molecules involved in proliferation such as Mef2a, Tcf4, Gls and Apod in MTf -/- mice compared to MTf +/+ littermates, suggesting a role for MTf in proliferation and tumorigenesis.Keywords: Melanotransferrin, knockout mouse, comparative genomic hybridization.

In light of the high degree of similarity between the epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) occurring in wound healing processes and the cancer stem cell-like compartment of tumors, including TGF-b-dependence, we investigated the role of a Grainyhead gene (GRHL2) in oncogenic EMT. Grainyhead was specifically down-regulated in the claudin-low subclass of mammary tumors and in the basal-B subclass of breast cancer cell lines. Functionally, GRHL2 suppressed TGF-b-induced, Twist-induced or spontaneous EMT, enhanced anoikis-sensitivity, and suppressed mammosphere generation in mammary epithelial cells. These effects were mediated, in part, by its suppression of ZEB1 expression, through direct repression of the ZEB1 promoter. GRHL2 also inhibited Smad-mediated transcription, and up-regulated mir200b/c as well as the TGF-b receptor antagonist, BMP2. The expression of GRHL2 in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 triggered a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and sensitized the cells to anoikis. These results indicate that GRHL2 is a suppressor of the oncogenic EMT. 3 biologic replicates for each cell line.

Human Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by chronic colonic inflammation and has been associated with an increased risk of colorectal carcinoma. Gene and protein expression profiles of ABCB1/MDR1 have been shown to be dysregulated in UC and sporadic colorectal cancer. We demonstrated that in a murine model of colitis-associated tumorigenesis, MDR1A KO mice showed reduced tumor load when compared to wildtype (WT) mice. The aim of this study was to identify gene alterations in colitis-associated tumors in the context of MDR1A deficiency.We used microarrays to assess gene expression profiles of colitis-associated colonic tumors from WT or MDR1A KO mice. We used the azoxymethane (AOM) / dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) - model to study the development of colitis-associated colorectal cancer in WT and MDR1A KO mice. AOM was administered once (10mg/kg body weight) to 6-week-old male mice, followed by treatments with 2.5% DSS (mol wt, 36,000-50,000) for 7 days in drinking water starting on day 0, 21 and 42, respectively. Mice were sacrificed at the experimental endpoint (day 84). At that time the entire colon and rectum were excised, cut longitudinally, and rinsed in ice-cold Hank's Balanced Salt Solution.

A major barrier to research on Parkinson's disease (PD) is inaccessibility of diseased tissue for study. One solution is to derive induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with PD and differentiate them into neurons affected by disease. We created an iPSC model of PD caused by triplication of SNCA encoding a-synuclein. a-Synuclein dysfunction is common to all forms of PD, and SNCA triplication leads to fully penetrant familial PD with accelerated pathogenesis. After differentiation of iPSCs into neurons enriched for midbrain dopaminergic subtypes, those from the patient contain double a-synuclein protein compared to those from an unaffected relative, precisely recapitulating the cause of PD in these individuals. A measurable biomarker makes this model ideal for drug screening for compounds that reduce levels of a-synuclein, and for mechanistic experiments to study PD pathogenesis.This gene expression microarray study was carried out as part of the validation process for demonstrating that the generated iPSC lines are pluripotent. 5 samples were analysed: two clonal iPSC lines from each of two genotypes (four in total; AST denoting alpha-synuclein triplication and NAS denoting normal alpha-synuclein), a human embryonic stem cell line (SHEF4).

Kupffer cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various liver diseases. However, their involvement in metabolic disorders of the liver, including fatty liver disease, remains unclear. The present study sought to determine the impact of Kupffer cells on hepatic triglyceride storage and to explore the possible mechanisms involved. To that end, C57Bl/6 mice rendered obese and steatotic by chronic high-fat feeding were treated for 1 week with clodronate liposomes, which cause depletion of Kupffer cells. Loss of expression of marker genes Cd68, F4/80, and Clec4f, and loss of Cd68 immunostaining verified almost complete removal of Kupffer cells from the liver. Also, expression of complement components C1, the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 6 (Ccl6), and cytokines interleukin-15 (IL-15) and IL-1beta were markedly reduced. Importantly, Kupffer cell depletion significantly decreased liver triglyceride and glucosylceramide levels concurrent with increased expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (Cpt1alpha), and fatty acid transport protein 2 (Fatp2). Treatment of mice with IL-1beta decreased expression of PPARalpha and its target genes, which was confirmed in primary hepatocytes. Consistent with these data, IL-1beta suppressed human and mouse PPARalpha promoter activity. Suppression of PPARalpha promoter activity was recapitulated by overexpression of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) subunit p50 and p65, and was abolished upon deletion of putative NF-kappaB binding sites. Finally, IL-1beta and NF-kappaB interfered with the ability of PPARalpha to activate gene transcription. CONCLUSION: Our data point toward important cross-talk between Kupffer cells and hepatocytes in the regulation of hepatic triglyceride storage. The effect of Kupffer cells on liver triglycerides are at least partially mediated by IL-1beta, which suppresses PPARalpha expression and activity.

Kabuki syndrome is a Mendelian intellectual disability syndrome caused by mutations in either of two genes (KMT2D and KDM6A) involved in chromatin accessibility. We previously showed that an agent that promotes chromatin opening, the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) AR-42, ameliorates the deficiency of adult neurogenesis in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, and rescues hippocampal memory defects in a mouse model of Kabuki syndrome (Kmt2d+/bGeo). Unlike a drug, a dietary intervention could be quickly transitioned to the clinic. Therefore, we have explored whether treatment with a ketogenic diet could lead to a similar rescue through increased amounts of beta-hydroxybutyrate, an endogenous HDACi. Here, we report that a ketogenic diet in Kmt2d+/bGeo mice modulates H3ac and H3K4me3 in the granular cell layer, with concomitant rescue of both the neurogenesis defect and hippocampal memory abnormalities seen in Kmt2d+/bGeo mice; similar effects on neurogenesis were observed upon exogenous administration of beta-hydroxybutyrate. These data suggests that dietary modulation of epigenetic modifications through elevation of beta-hydroxybutyrate may provide a feasible strategy to treat the intellectual disability seen in Kabuki syndrome and related disorders.We used microarrays to query global gene expression changes in the hippocampus of wild type and Kmt2d+/bGeo (Kabuki syndrome model) mice on a regular diet to identify specific gene expression abnormalities in the hippocampus of the Kabuki syndrome mouse model. Two different microarray experiments were run using cDNA synthesized using RNA extracted from whole mouse hippocampi. In both, hippocampi were dissected from 1-2 month old wild type and Kmt2d+/bGeo mice (mouse model of Kabuki syndrome) on a standard diet. In the first experiment 4 wild type and 3 Kmt2d+/bGeo were profiled, and in the second experiment 3 wild type and 3 Kmt2d+/bGeo were profiled.",

Here, we explore gene expression networks in normal adult skin from 470 genetically unique mice, and demonstrate the dependence of the architecture of signaling pathways on skin tissue location (dorsal or tail skin) and perturbation by induction of inflammation or tumorigenesis. Gene networks related to specific cell types, as well as signaling pathways including Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), Wnt, Lgr family stem cell markers, and keratins differed at these tissue sites, suggesting mechanisms for the differential susceptibility of dorsal and tail skin to development of skin diseases and tumorigenesis.

Background: Fasciola hepatica infection still remains one of the helminthic neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). It has a huge worldwide distribution, affecting mainly cattle and, sometimes, human beings. In addition to data reported about the immunological response induced by helminthic infections and that induced by Fasciola hepatica, little is known about the gene expression profile in its organ target, the liver, which is where adult worms are established and live for long periods of time, causing its characteristic pathology. In the present work, we study both the early and late gene expression profiles in the livers of mice infected with Fasciola hepatica metacercariae using a microarray-based methodology.Methodology: A total of 9 female-6-week-old BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories, Barcelona, Spain) weighing 20 to 35 g were used for the experiments. Two groups of BALB/c mice were orally infected with seven F. hepatica metacercariae, and the other group remained untreated and served as a control. Mice were humanely euthanized and necropsied for liver recovery, histological assessment of hepatic damage, RNA isolation, microarray design and gene expression analysis on the day of infection (t0), seven days post-infection (t7) and twenty-one days post-infection (t21).Results: We found that Fasciola hepatica infection induces the differential expression of 128 genes in the liver in the early stage of infection and 308 genes in the late stage, and most of them are up-regulated. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed significant changes in the pathways related to metabolism, biosynthesis and signaling as well as genes implicated in inducing liver-toxicity, injury and death.Conclusion: The present study provides us insights at the molecular level about the underlying mechanisms used by Fasciola hepatica, leading to liver damage and its subsequent pathophysiology. The expression pattern obtained here could also be used to explain the lack of association between infection with F. hepatica and cholangiocarcinoma. However, more studies should be performed to confirm this hypothesis. We used three experimental groups each containing 3 mice. Group 1 remains untreated and served as control. Group 2 was infected with Fasciola hepatica metacercariae on day 0 and humanely necropsied at 7 days post-infection. Group 3 was infected with Fasciola hepatica metacercariae on day 0 and humanely necropsied at 21 days post- infection. At the time of necropsy, liver of each mice were removed and the RNA was isolated. We compared the gene expression profile in the liver of mice infected with Fasciola hepatica.",

Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is the third most prevalent cardiomyopathy in children and has a unique phenotype with characteristically extensive hypertrabeculation of the left ventricle, similar to the embryonic left ventricle, suggesting a developmental defect of the embryonic myocardium. However, studying this disease has been challenging due to the lack of an animal model that can faithfully recapitulate the clinical phenotype of LVNC. To address this, we show that patient-specific hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) generated from a family with LVNC recapitulated a developmental defect consistent with the LVNC phenotype at the single-cell level. We then utilized hiPSC-CMs to show that increased transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) signaling is one of the central mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of LVNC. LVNC hiPSC-CMs demonstrated decreased proliferative capacity due to abnormal activation of TGFb signaling. Exome sequencing demonstrated a mutation in TBX20, which regulates TGFb signaling, contributing to the LVNC phenotype. Our results demonstrate that hiPSC-CMs are a useful tool for the exploration of novel mechanisms underlying poorly understood cardiomyopathies such as LVNC. Here we provide the first evidence of activation of TGF signaling as playing a role in the pathogenesis of LVNC. mRNA expression profiles in human iPSC derived cardiomyocytes obtained from 2 independent unrelated control, 1 asymptomatic mild DCM (2 iPSC lines) and 3 LVNC patients (2 proband lines and 1 lines from 2 siblings) 2 weeks after starting cardiac differentiation.",

Aging is the progressive decline in organismal function that leads to an increased risk of multiple diseases and mortality. The molecular basis of this decline is unknown. Using quantitative PCR for mitochondrial mRNA from multiple tissues from the same animals, we found that the rate of change in mouse mitochondrial expression is tissue-specific, with cardiac expression declining early (8-10 months), adipose expression declining late (25-30 months), and no change in kidney or skin. In cardiac tissue, mitochondria-derived mRNA levels declined more slowly than nuclear encoded mRNAs, suggesting a potential dysregulation. These changes were independent of alteration in mitochondrial number, as measured by quantitative PCR of mitochondrial DNA and citrate synthase activity. We found no change in the variability between mitochondrial mRNA levels with age, suggesting that the changes are not due to random dysregulation at the level of gene expression. Caloric restriction (CR), a lifespan-extending intervention proposed to act through mitochondrial biogenesis, delayed the decline in both cardiac and adipose mitochondrial mRNA levels of F344 rats. CR caused an increase in citrate synthase activity but did not alter mitochondrial DNA content, indicating increased translation or reduced turnover of mitochondrial proteins. These results demonstrate that mitochondrial gene expression changes with age are not coupled to mitochondrial number, are likely to be regulated, and are governed by tissue-specific processes. These findings indicate that aging is neither a programmed organism-wide change orchestrated in a top-down fashion nor a product of random dysregulation of gene expression but that tissue-specific factors may independently control aging in different organ compartments.Keywords: aging.

Tet enzymes have been extensively studied in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, which are generally cultured in the absence of Vitamin C, a potential co-factor for Fe(II) 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase enzymes like Tets. Here we report that addition of Vitamin C to ES cells promotes Tet activity leading to a rapid and global increase in hmC. This is followed by DNA demethylation of numerous gene promoters and up-regulation of demethylated germline genes. Tet1 binding is enriched near the transcription start site (TSS) of genes affected by Vitamin C treatment. Importantly, Vitamin C, but not other antioxidants, enhances the activity of recombinant human Tet1 in a biochemical assay and the Vitamin C-induced changes in hmC and mC are entirely suppressed in Tet1/2 double knockout (Tet DKO) ES cells. Vitamin C has the strongest effects on regions that gain methylation in cultured ES cells compared to blastocysts and in vivo are methylated only after implantation. In contrast, imprinted regions and intracisternal A-particle (IAP) elements, which are resistant to demethylation in the early embryo, are resistant to Vitamin C-induced DNA demethylation. Collectively, this study establishes that Vitamin C is a direct regulator of Tet activity and DNA methylation fidelity in ES cells. Oct4-GiP mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were cultured in the presence or absence of Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, 200 mg/ml) for 72 hours. RNA was harvested from biological triplicates for each condition and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays. Cells were maintained in N2B27 medium supplemented with LIF (1000 U/ml), MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (1 mM), and GSK3b inhibitor CHIR99021 (3 mM).",

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is associated with the accumulation of collagen-secreting fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in the lung parenchyma. Many mechanisms contribute to their accumulation, including resistance to apoptosis. In previous work, we showed that exposure to the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-a and IFN-g reverses fibroblast resistance to apoptosis. The goal of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanism. Based on an initial interrogation of the transcriptomes of unstimulated and TNF-a and IFN-g-stimulated primary lung fibroblasts and the lung fibroblast cell line, MRC5, we show here that among Fas-signaling pathway molecules, Fas expression was increased ~6-fold in an NF-kB and p38mapk-dependent fashion. Prevention of the increase in Fas expression using Fas siRNAs blocked the ability of TNF-a and IFN-g to sensitize fibroblasts to Fas ligation induced-apoptosis; while enforced adenovirus-mediated Fas overexpression was sufficient to overcome basal resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis. Examination of lung tissues from IPF patients revealed low to absent staining of Fas in fibroblastic cells of fibroblast foci. Collectively, these findings suggest that increased expression of Fas is necessary and sufficient to overcome the resistance of lung fibroblasts to Fas-induced apoptosis. They also suggest that approaches aimed at increasing Fas expression by lung fibroblasts and myofibroblasts may be therapeutically relevant. To investigate the mechanism by which TNF-a and IFN-g reprogram fibroblasts from resistance to sensitivity to Fas-ligation-induce apoptosis, we exposed human primary lung fibroblasts from an IPF patient (FS087) and non-disease control subject (N78) and the human fetal lung fibroblast cell lung (MRC-5) to TNF-a (10 ng/ml) and IFN-g (50 U/ml) for 36 hr and analyzed changes in their transcriptomes using Affymetrix microarrays.",

Liver cirrhosis is a strong risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), yet the mechanisms by which cirrhosis predisposes patients to tumorigenesis are not well understood. Transgenic mice expressing platelet-derived growth factor C (Pdgf-c) under the control of the albumin promoter provide a unique animal model that mimics the step-wise disease progression in humans from fibrosis to HCC. The livers of Pdgf-c Tg mice show evidence of liver injury, including inflammation, proliferation, fibrosis and steatosis, and as the mice age, angiogenesis and dysplasia. Eighty-five percent of these mice develop HCC spontaneously, and have reduced survival that is related to their liver pathology. Through measurement of protein, RNA, and histological markers, we provide evidence to support the hypothesis that changes in liver stromal cells play an essential role in tumorigenesis in this model. A paracrine signaling model is proposed where ectopic expression of Pdgf-c in hepatocytes results in activation of hepatic stellate cells, which subsequently activates endothelial and Kupffer cells. Activation of these non-parenchymal cells promotes the release of hepatocyte growth factors that, together with changes in extracellular matrix, lead to the formation of HCC. Pdgf-c Tg mice provide a useful pre-clinical model in which to test novel drugs for chronic liver disease and HCC that focus on blocking the processes that alter the liver's fibrotic microenvironment. Two strains of mice, C57BL/6 and C57/BL6 Pdgf-c transgenic, were analyzed to see if liver stromal cells play an essential role in tumorigenesis.",

Background: In the remodeling process of the volume-overloaded heart, the extracellular matrix (ECM) may be dynamically modified to adapt to hemodynamic stress. We investigated the expression of ECM-related genes and modification of the elastin network in the remodeling process of the left ventricles (LVs) of rats with aortocaval fistulae. Methods and Findings: Gene array analysis identified 36 upregulated and 11 downregulated ECM-related genes during evolution from the compensated to the late decompensated phase. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified the formation of elastic fibers as an important biological function. Real-time PCR confirmed persistent upregulation of elastogenesis-associated genes, including elastin, lysyl oxidase, lysyl oxidase like-1, fibrillin 1, fibulin 2, versican and latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 2 at various intervals. The expression levels and enzymatic activities of potent elastases, cathepsin S and cathepsin K increased during the early phase. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy showed that the microstructure of the elastin network was preserved during the early phase, degraded during the compensated phase, partially repaired during the early decompensated phase, and reinforced during the late decompensated phase. Assessment of elastin concentrations in the LVs showed a consistent temporal pattern throughout the course.Conclusions: In the volume-overloaded heart, upregulation of potent elastases during the early phase and persistent upregulation of elastogenesis-related genes result in early degradation followed by repair and reinforcement of the elastin network of the LV. Remodeling of the elastin network may contribute to changes in the mechanical property of the volume-overloaded heart.

C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) has been recently identified as an important anabolic regulator of endochondral bone growth, but the molecular mechanism mediating these effects are not completely understood. Here we demonstrate that CNP activates the p38 MAP kinase pathway in chondrocytes and that pharmacological inhibition of p38 blocks the anabolic effects of CNP in a tibia organ culture system. We further show that CNP stimulates endochondral bone growth largely through expansion of the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate, while delaying mineralization. Both effects are reversed by p38 inhibition. We performed Affymetrix microarray analyses to identify CNP target genes in the organ culture system. These studies confirmed that hypertrophic chondrocytes are the main targets of CNP signaling in the growth plate, potentially because cGMP-dependent kinases I and II, important transducers of CNP signaling and are expressed at much higher levels in these cells than in other areas of the tibia. One of the genes most strongly induced by CNP was the Ptgs2 gene, encoding Cox2. Real-time PCR confirmed that Cox2 expression was induced by CNP in hypertrophic chondrocytes, but surprisingly in a p38-independent manner. Moreover, Cox2 inhibition - in contrast to p38 inhibition - did not block the anabolic effects of CNP. In summary, our data identify novel target genes of CNP and demonstrate that the p38 pathway is a novel, essential mediator of CNP effects on endochondral ossification, with potential implications for numerous skeletal diseases.Keywords: Growth plate zone comparison and treatment response analysis .

Background: The BRCA1 protein has been shown to play critical roles in several molecular pathways, but the specific defect(s) that promote breast and ovarian carcinogenesis remain a mystery. Furthermore, while mutations that result in a truncated protein can unequivocally be called disease-causing, many other variants mutations have poorly defined clinical significance. Given these factors, development of a functional assay for BRCA1 is a significant clinical priority, but presents significant biological challenges. Methodology and Significant Findings: We have developed a novel function-based assay for BRCA1 carrier identification by examining the effect of loss of a single copy of BRCA1 on global gene expression levels. Comparison of the gene expression profiles of undamaged, actively cycling EBV-transformed lymphocytes allowed accurate discrimination between BRCA1+/+ and BRCA1+/- cells. The best predictor was 100% (16/16) accurate in predicting BRCA1 status in an independent test set; the overall sensitivity and specificity of the test are 84% and 92%, respectively, when the training set data (53 samples) is also included. A set of 22 genes was identified by two distinct analytical approaches, including a set of 11 genes (TBX21, MX2, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, GLDC, F13A1, SOX4, LCK, HERC5, USP18) that could be linked in a single pathway encompassing cellular proliferation and development. By contrast, analysis of the same samples for global gene expression level changes following irradiation did not support the development of an accurate class predictor. Conclusions and Significance: Our results support the idea that the fundamental defect resulting from BRCA1 mutation is a reduction in cellular differentiation, and that changes in the DNA damage response require inactivation of the second BRCA1 allele. Given that the class predictor we have developed was based on unperturbed cells, this work could ultimately lead to the development of a rapid and accurate test for identification of BRCA1 mutation carriers. 69 cell lines consist of 38 control (BRCA1+/+) and 31 BRCA1 mutation carriers (BRCA1+/-), two color arrays, non radiated vs. radiated for each cell line.

We found that Cav3.2 is highly expressed in human GBM specimens and enriched in GCSs. Analyses of TCGA and REMBRANDT databases confirmed the upregulation of Cav3.2 in a subset of tumors (TCGA) and showed that overexpression is associated with worse prognosis. Mibefradil and Cav3.2 knockdown inhibited the growth, survival and stemness of GSCs and sensitized them to temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. To investigate the mechanisms of action of Cav3.2 in GSC, we performed proteomic and transcriptomic screenings followed by functional rescue experiments. Inhibition of Cav3.2 altered cancer signaling pathways and gene transcription. Among other, inhibition of Cav3.2 suppressed GSC growth through inhibition of pro-survival pathways AKT/mTOR, and induction of apoptosis through upregulation of survivin, BAX and cleavage of caspase 9 and PARP.

Bmi1 is responsible for conversion of adult mouse astrocytes and fibroblasts into neural stem cell-like cells and conversion of fibroblasts into iPSCs under enforced expression of Oct4. Here, in the first step of generating iPSCs, stable intermediate cells were generated from mouse astrocytes by Bmi1 in the absence of other transcription factors.

The cells were inhibited or not for FGFR1.Glioblastoma are known to be aggressive and therapy-resistant tumors, due to the presence of glioblastoma stem cells (GSC) inside this heterogeneous tumor. We investigate here the involvement of FGFR1 in glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSLC) radioresistance mechanisms. We first demonstrated that the survival after irradiation was significantly diminished in FGFR1-silenced (FGFR1-) GSLC compared to control GSLC. The transcriptome analysis of GSLCs FGFR1(-) showed that FOX family members are differentially regulated by FGFR1 inhibition, particularly with an upregulation of FOXN3 and a downregulation of FOXM1. GSLC survival after irradiation was significantly increased after FOXN3 silencing and decreased after FOXM1 inhibition, showing opposite effects of FGFR1/FOX family members on cell response to ionizing radiation. Silencing FGFR1 or FOXM1 downregulated genes involved in mesenchymal transition such as GLI2, TWIST1, and ZEB1 in GSC. It also dramatically reduced GSLC migration, strongly suggesting that FGFR1/FOXM1 pathway which regulates GSLC radioresistance. Databases analysis confirmed that the combined expression of FGFR1/FOXM1/MELK/GLI2/ZEB1/TWIST1 is significantly associated with patients overall survival after chemo-radiotherapy treatment. All these results, associated with our previous conduced ones with differentiated cells, clearly established that FGFR1-FOXM1 dependent GSC radioresistance pathway is a central actor of GBM treatment resistance and a key target to inhibit in the aim to increase the sensitivity of GBM to the radiotherapy. Cells were transfected with different small interfering RNAs (siRNA): an aleatory sequence, SiScramble siRNA and siRNAs specific for FGFR1 (QIAGEN, SI02224677, Courtaboeuf, France). Total RNAs were isolated either from Neurospheres 48h post-transfection and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.",

The immune system cellular response to tissue damage and infection requires the recruitment of blood leukocytes to the target tissue. This process is mediated through a classical multistep mechanism which involves transient rolling on the endothelium and recognition of inflammation followed by extravasation. We show here, by direct examination of blood monocyte functions in vivo, that resident monocytes monitor the endothelium of healthy tissues through patrolling, a new mechanism which allows extravasation in the absence of rolling.Patrolling depends on the integrin LFA1 and the chemokine receptor CX3CR1, and is required for rapid tissue invasion and initiation of an early immune response by monocytes that differentiate into macrophages at the site of tissue damage and infection.The main goal of the experiment was to compare expression levels of genes in Gr1- monocytes in the blood and after recruitment in the peritoneum during experimental infection with Listeria monocytogenes (time course analysis).Keywords: expression profiling; time course analysis; infection response. Six-weeks old (C57Bl6, Cx3cr1gfp/+) mice were intraperitonealy infected with a low number (1.104) of L. monocytogenes (EGDe strain) in exponential growth phase (bacteria were grown in BHI at 108/ml, and diluted 10.000x in PBS immediately before injection).

Analysis of various of up-regulated and down-regulated genes in Normal Cervical mucosa, Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and Cervical squamous cell carcinoma. The report provides a data analysis methodology for identification of co-expressed gene patterns, as emerging clusters, in global transcriptome of cervical mucosal pre-malignant and malignant conditions in comparison to their normal counterparts.Microarray based study of global gene expression is often used to extract molecular signatures underlying cancer progression. Such endeavors endorse self organizing map, a type of artificial neural network to analyze high dimensional pre-processed transcriptome data to segregate hotspot genes in component plane for disease subtypes. This report provides a data analysis methodology for identification of coexpressed gene patterns, as emerging clusters, in global transcriptome of oral and cervical mucosal premalignant and malignant conditions in comparison to their normal counterparts. Four exclusive cluster patterns, each involving 100 - 300 genes, were identified from component planes for oral study groups. Gene expression associated with each pattern belonged to 32 biological processes. Analysis on cervical biopsies, where cancer was compared to cervical interepithelial neoplasia and normal counterpart, it revealed three non-overlapping patterns for each condition. In cervical interepithelial neoplasia an intermediate pattern with nine different dominant functional processes was identified, whereas, in cervical squamous cell carcinoma pattern showed dominance for seven different functions. This analysis demonstrated utility of self organizing map to capture dominant enriched patterns as visual plots and revealed six common biological processes like transcription and RNA processing, cytoskeleton reorganization, angiogenesis, immunity, neuron signalling, and connective tissue remodelling in the pathogenesis of oral and cervical cancers. In fact it could provide an intuitive understanding of molecular course in carcinogenesis and may contribute for combinatorial biomarker discovery. Cervical cancer is among top ten cancers worldwide with mortality rate of 52 % . It goes through a series of pre-malignant stages - Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia CIN 1, 2 and 3. However, some CIN2 lesions may develop soon after HPV infection, suggesting that there could be alternate pathways involved. Incisional biopsies from Cervical interepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and Cervical squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) were collected. All the collected biopsies were divided into two and one half was processed for the purpose of light microscopy evaluation. After histopathological confirmation of disease condition by onco-pathologist, the other half of the tissue was used for microarray analysis. In the inclusion of histopathologically normal cervical biopsies were done from patients undergoing hysterectomy due to prolapsed uterus or uterine polyp or fibroid. The aim of the study is to investigate the differential transcrptomics modulations that are responsible for the transition of normal cervical mucosa to CIN and later its malignant transformation to cancer.",

Several functions have been suggested for the interferon induced transmembrane protein 1 (Iftitm1) gene in mammals. Originally it was identified as a member of a gene family that is highly inducible by type I and type II inteferons. Based on its expression during primordial germ CELl (PGC) specification it was suggested to be required for normal PGC migration. Ifitm1 targeted knockdown experiments in mouse embryos provided evidence that the gene might be necessary for normal somitogenesis. Finally, the complete deletion of the Ifitm gene cluster on mouse chromosome 7 revealed that the five deleted Ifitm1 genes are not essential for PCG migration and fertility. Here, we generated a novel targeted knockin allele of the Ifitm1 gene by replacing its coding region with a lacZ reporter gene to systematically reassess the suggested functions of this gene.We find that during embryogenesis somites and in the adult the vertebral column appear normal in homozygous Ifitm1 knockout mice, strongly suggesting that Ifitm1 is not essential for normal segmentation of the paraxial mesoderm. In addition, homozygous Ifitm1 mutant mice are fertile, reproduce normally and have normal sperm quality. Furthermore, we show that the Ifitm1 loss-of-function allele does not cause immunological mutant phenotypes in unchallenged as well as in Listeria challenged homozygous mutant animals. To further focus on unique functional requirements of Ifitm1, we took advantage of the lacZ reporter gene in the Ifitm1 locus to analyze for the first time in detail and with high sensitivity its complex expression pattern in mouse embryos from E8.5 to E14.5 and in adult organs. The detailed description of the Ifitm1 expression domains will support the identification of organs that might be affected by the loss of Ifitm1 function. We performed gene expression microarray analysis of ten lung tissues from male adult Ifitm1-deficient and control mice.",

We demonstrate that LOAD reconfigures specific portions of the molecular interaction structure, and via an integrative network-based approach we rank ordered these sub-networks (modules) for relevance to LOAD pathology, highlighting the immune/microglia module as the top ranking.

Downregulation of expression and activity levels of the astroglial glutamate transporter EAAT2 is thought to be implicated in motor neuron excitotoxicity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We previously reported that EAAT2 is cleaved by caspase-3 at the cytosolic C-terminus domain, impairing the transport activity and generating a proteolytic fragment found to be SUMO1 conjugated (CTE-SUMO1). We show here that this fragment accumulates in the nucleus of spinal cord astrocytes in vivo throughout the disease stages of the SOD1-G93A mouse model of ALS. In vitro expression in spinal cord astrocytes of the C-terminus peptide of EAAT2 (CTE), which was artificially fused to SUMO1 (CTE-SUMO1fus) to mimic the endogenous SUMOylation reaction, recapitulates the nuclear accumulation of the fragment seen in vivo and causes caspase-3 activation and axonal growth impairment in motor neuron-derived NSC-34 cells and primary motor neurons co-cultured with CTE-SUMO1fus-expressing spinal cord astrocytes. This indicates that CTE-SUMO1fus could trigger non-cell autonomous mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Prolonged nuclear accumulation of CTE-SUMO1fus in astrocytes leads to their degeneration, although the time frame of the cell-autonomous toxicity is longer than the one for the indirect toxic effect on motor neurons. As more evidence on the implication of SUMO substrates in neurodegenerative diseases emerges, our observations strongly suggest that the nuclear accumulation in spinal cord astrocytes of a SUMOylated proteolytic fragment of the astroglial glutamate transporter EAAT2 could take part to the pathogenesis of ALS and suggest a novel, unconventional role for EAAT2 in motor neuron degeneration in ALS. Comparison is made between the toxic fragment (SUMO) and the same fragment without lysines that can be sumo-ylated (CTE). Four replicates have been performed for each sample group.",

Microarrays have shown that gene expression patterns can be used to molecularly classify breast cancers into distinct and clinically significant groups. In order to translate these profiles into routine diagnostics, we have recapitulated a microarray breast cancer classification using real-time quantitative (q)RT-PCR. We performed statistical analyses on multiple independent microarray datasets to select an \"intrinsic\" gene set that can classify breast tumors into four different subtypes designated as Luminal, Normal-like, HER2+/ER-, and Basal-like. A minimal gene set from the microarray \"intrinsic\" list, and additional genes important for outcome (e.g., proliferation genes), were used to develop a real-time qRT-PCR assay comprised of 53 classifiers and 3 housekeepers. We prospectively compared the expression data and classifications from microarray and real-time qRT-PCR using 123 unique breast samples (117 invasive carcinomas, 1 fibroadenoma and 5 normal tissues) and 3 cells lines. The overall correlation for the 50 genes in common between microarray and qRT-PCR was 0.76. There was 91% (114/126) concordance in the hierarchical clustering classification of the real-time qRT-PCR minimal \"intrinsic\" gene set (37 genes) and the larger (402 genes) microarray gene set from which the PCR list was derived. As expected, the Luminal tumors (ER+) had a significantly better outcome than the HER2+/ER- (p=0.043) and Basal-like tumors (p=0.001).

IFN-g is a critical cytokine which regulates both innate and adaptive immune. Ample evidences have elucidated the mechanisms of IFN-g mediated antitumor effects, including driving T Helper Type 1 (Th1) polarization, activating cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) and natural killer T cells, upregulating major histocompatibility complex class I expression (MHC Class I) in tumor cells, and inhibiting tumor cells proliferation, inducing tumor cells apoptosis. Despite the multiple effects in cancer immune elimination phase (also known as cancer immune surveillance), IFN-g also effectuates antitumor immunity and protumorigenic activities throughout the cancer immunoediting process including elimination phase and escape phase. One of the most important mechanism elucidating the dual effect of IFN-g in immunoediting is IFN-g induced PD-L1 expression in cancer cells. To obtain a detailed molecular appreciation of what was going on in tumor microenvironment under the influence of IFN-g, we performed global gene expression analysis using the Agilent oligonucleotide microarray system. First, we evaluated the IFN-g expression in a uniform cohort of patients with IIIA lung adenocarcinoma from our patient archive. IFN-g expression was assessed by means of RT-PCR. The median DCt value from tested specimens was set as breakpoint, IFN-g expression below median DCt value was considered as low IFN-g group (IFN-g-) whereas above median DCt value was the high IFN-g group (IFN-g+). Then, we analyzed PD-L1 expression by IHC staining of biopsy specimens in whole slides.

Biopsy specimens from 12 lung adenocarcinoma patients were included to perform the Agilent oligonucleotide microarray system. Six of biopsy specimens contain high levels of IFN-g while others expressing IFN-g at low or undetectable levels.

Its complex etiology requires the development of an in vitro model that appropriately recapitulates the physiopathology of this disease. In this study, we exploited the self-assembly method in order to develop a new tissue-engineered model of psoriatic skin substitutes. To circumvent the addition of immune cells, we supplemented the reconstructed psoriatic substitutes with a cocktail of four cytokines, TNF-a, IL-1a, IL-6 and IL-17, and monitored their impact on global gene expression by DNA microarray. The cytokines-supplemented substitutes have a more irregular epidermis, with protuberances and much thinner areas. Most interestingly, gene profiling on microarrays identified several genes reported as being deregulated psoriasis skin in vivo. Indeed, expression of the S100A12, IL8, DEFB4A and KYNU genes increased dramatically compared to their level in normal skin substitutes (P <0.005 to <0.05). In addition, the ACSBG1 gene, reported to be repressed in psoriasis, was also repressed in the cytokines-supplemented psoriatic substitutes compared to the controls (P <0.005). The product encoded by the genes deregulated in the cytokines-supplemented substitutes belong to biological pathways, such as the inflammatory and the immune responses, that are similarly altered in psoriasis in vivo. In conclusion, addition of cytokines to involved psoriatic substitutes alters the transcriptome of these cells in a manner similar to that observed with psoriasis in vivo.

Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an aggressive form of BC poorly defined at the molecular level. We compared the molecular portraits of 63 IBC and 134 non-IBC (nIBC) clinical samples. Genomic imbalances of 49 IBCs and 124 nIBCs were determined using high-resolution array-comparative genomic hybridization, and mRNA expression profiles of 197 samples using whole-genome microarrays. Genomic profiles of IBCs were as heterogeneous as those of nIBCs, and globally relatively close. However, IBCs showed more frequent \"complex\" patterns and a higher percentage of genes with CNAs per sample. The number of altered regions was similar in both types, although some regions were altered more frequently and/or with higher amplitude in IBCs. Many genes were similarly altered in both types; however, more genes displayed recurrent amplifications in IBCs. Pre-treatment tumor tissues were collected from 197 patients with invasive adenocarcinomas. Patients underwent surgical biopsies or initial surgery at the Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC, Marseille, France) between 1987 and 2007. Each patient gave written informed consent and the study was approved by the IPC \"Comite d'Orientation Strategique\". Tumor samples were macrodissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen within 30 minutes of removal. Before RNA extraction, tumor sections were reviewed by two pathologists and contained more than 60% of tumor cells.

Global gene expression patterns associated with early stage endometrial cancer have been reported, but changes in molecular expression associated with tumor grade, depth of myometrial invasion, and non-endometrioid histology have not been previously elucidated. Our group hypothesized there are unique genetic events underlying early endometrial carcinogenesis. Ninety-two samples of pathologically reviewed stage I endometrial cancers (80 endometrioid and 12 serous) with a heterogeneous distribution of grade and depth of myometrial invasion (i.e. 9 IAG1, 14 IAG2, 7 IAG3, 14 IBG1, 12 IBG2, 13 IBG3, 7 ICG1, 10 ICG2, and 6 ICG3) were examined in relation to 12 samples of atrophic endometrium from postmenopausal women. Specimens were analyzed using oligonucleotide microarray analysis and a subset of the differentially expressed transcripts was validated using quantitative PCR. Comparison of early stage cancers with normal endometrium samples by the univariate t-test with 10,000 permutations identified 900 genes that were differentially regulated by at least 4-fold at a p value of <0.001. Unsupervised analysis revealed that when compared to normal endometrium, serous and endometrioid stage I cancers appeared to have similar expression patterns. However, when compared in the absence of normal controls, they were distinct. Differential expression analysis revealed a number of transcripts that were common as well as unique to both histologic types. This data uncovers previously unrecognized, novel pathways involved in early stage endometrial cancers and identifys targets for prevention strategies that are inclusive of both endometrioid and serous histologic subtypes. Ninety-one samples of pathologically reviewed stage I endometrial cancers (79 endometrioid and 12 serous) with a heterogeneous distribution of grade and depth of myometrial invasion (i.e. 9 IAG1, 14 IAG2, 7 IAG3, 14 IBG1, 12 IBG2, 13 IBG3, 7 ICG1, 10 ICG2, and 6 ICG3) were examined in relation to 12 samples of atrophic endometrium from postmenopausal women.

IFX is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, but how IFX affect KD vasculitis is unknown. We investigated expression profiling of whole blood cells to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the effectiveness of IFX therapy and to find characteristic biomarker and an important target in refractory KD. Methods: Refractory KD patients who failed to respond to repeated intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) infusions had received a single infusion of IFX as third therapy. To validate specifically transcripts abundance for IFX therapy, we detected the altered transcripts expression and signaling pathways of whole blood mRNA in these IFX-responsive patients (n=8) using Affymetrix array, comparing initial IVIG-responsive patients (n=6).Results: A total of 1,388 transcripts abundance were significantly altered before and after IFX treatment. These transcripts abundance in IFX had Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain pathway that play a role in activation of NFkB and IL-1 signaling pathway outside the field of TNF-a signaling pathway. Fifty transcripts including Peptidase inhibitor-3 (PI3), Matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP8), Chemokine (C-C motif) receptor-2 (CCR2) and Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) were significantly down-regulated in IFX.

Bladder cancer (BC) is a highly prevalent human disease in which Rb pathway inactivation and epigenetic alterations are common events. However, the connection between these two processes is still poorly understood. Here we show that the in vivo inactivation of all Rb family genes in the mouse urothelium is sufficient to initiate BC development. The characterization of the mouse tumors revealed multiple molecular features of human BC, including the activation of E2F transcription factor and subsequent Ezh2 expression, and the activation of several signaling pathways previously identified as highly relevant in urothelial tumors. Whole transcriptional characterizations of the mouse bladder tumors revealed a significant overlap with human BC samples, and a predominant role for Ezh2 in the downregulation of gene expression programs. Importantly, we determined that in human superficial BC patients, the increased tumor recurrence and progression in these recurrences is associated with increased E2F and Ezh2 expression and Ezh2-mediated gene expression repression. Collectively, our studies provide a genetically defined model for human high-grade superficial BC and demonstrate the existence of an Rb-E2F-Ezh2 axis in bladder whose disruption can promote tumor development.

In Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma(cHL) expression of FOXO1 is low or absent. We overexpressed constitutively active mutant of FOXO1 fused in frame with estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain (FOXO1(3A)ER), which can be activated by 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), in cHL cell lines KM-H2 and L428. Activation of the FOXO1 with 4-OHT resulted in inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis. Using gene-expression array we found that FOXO1 activates transcription of known and potential tumor suppressor genes: CDKN1B, PMAIP1, BCL2L11, TNFSF10, FBXO32, CBLB). Of note, FOXO1 repressed transcription of several cytokines and cytokine receptors, which are known tobe involved in pathogenesis of cHL (e.g. CCL5, CXCR5, TNFRSF8).

Scnn1b-Tg mice overexpress the beta subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (Scnn1b) in airway Club cells. The general phenotype of these mice is described in three published manuscripts (Mall et al. 2004, Nature Medicine, 10(5):487-93; Mall et al. 2008, Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 177(7):730-42; and Livraghi-Butrico et al. 2012, Physiol.

Briefly, overexpression of the Scnn1b transgene in airway Club cells leads to hyperabsorption of sodium from the airway surface liquid, dehydrated airway surface liquid and mucus, and reduced mucus clearance associated with accumulation of mucus plugs/plaques. The data provided here represents mRNA expression data from disseccted whole trachea (distal and proximal ends cut 3-4 cartliage rings below the larynx and just above the bifurcation, respectively) from male WT and Scnn1b-Tg littermates (C57Bl/6NTac background) at 4 time points [postnatal days (PND) 0, 3, 10, and 42]. PND 0 trachea are histologically normal, a tracheal mucus plug/obstruction develops around PND 3, the plug is receding to more distal airways by PND 10, and the trachea is again histologically normal by PND 42. The data from the WT mice provides a global look at mRNA changes across time, while the data from the Scnn1b-Tg line provides mRNA data that allows differential gene expression due to mucus obstruction to be queried.The data presented for the purified is part of a larger body of work evaluating gene expression in whole lung, trachea, and purified macrophages. 30 total macrophage samples were analyzed; three from each timepoint (postnatal day 0, 3, 10, and 42) for both wildtype and Scnn1b-transgenic mice grown in specific-pathogen-free facilities and from postnatal day 42 wildtype and Scnn1b-transgenic mice maintained in a germ-free facility. In our manuscript, we were most interested in changes between WT and Scnn1b-Tg mice, however, the data can also be used to evaluate changes in gene expression across time (postnatal day 0, 3, 10, and 42). This data can also be used to evaluate the differences in macrophage biology at postnatal day 42 when mice are grown in specific-pathogen-free versus germ-free environments.",

Hepatocyte-nuclear-factor-4a (Hnf4a) is a transcription factor that controls epithelial cell polarity and maturation during embryogenesis. Hnf4a conditional deletion during post-natal development results in minor consequences on intestinal epithelium integrity but promotes activation of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway. Here we show that Hnf4a does not act as a tumor suppressor gene but is crucial to promote gut tumorigenesis in mice. Polyp multiplicity in ApcMin mice that lacks Hnf4a is suppressed in comparison to littermate ApcMin controls. Analysis of microarray gene expression profiles from mice lacking Hnf4a in the intestinal epithelium identifies its novel function in regulating the expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxifying genes. This role is supported with the demonstration that HNF4a is functionally involved in the protection against spontaneous and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy-induced production of intracellular ROS in colorectal cancer cell lines. The analysis of a colorectal cancer patient cohort establishes that HNF4a is significantly up-regulated at both gene transcript and protein levels in tumors relative to adjacent benign epithelial resections. Several genes involved in ROS neutralization are also up-regulated in correlation with HNF4a expression. All together, the findings point to the nuclear receptor HNF4a as a potential therapeutic target to eradicate aberrant epithelial cell resistance to ROS production during intestinal tumorigenesis. HNF4alpha was conditionally knockout in the mouse epithelial intestine with the 12.4-kb VillinCRE. A total of 3 control and 3 mutant littermates individuals were sacrificed at 7 months of age.

In this study, we subjected the phenomenon of fractional killing in a clonal population of TRAIL-sensitive cells to careful analysis. We asked whether cells that survive initial exposure to TRAIL are sensitive or resistant to subsequent treatment with TRAIL or other apoptosis-inducing agents. We observed that TRAIL survivor cells were highly resistant to a subsequent treatment with TRAIL 24hr later but that this resistance disappeared following several days in culture. Resistance did not involve downregulation of TRAIL receptors and extended to death ligands that bind different classes of receptors: TRAIL survivors were transiently resistant to FasL and vice versa. Gene expression analysis revealed that NF-kB-mediated inflammatory genes were activated in transiently resistant survivor cells leading to an inflammatory phenotype, but resistance was mediated by an independent mechanism related to changes in signaling at the DISC. Periodic exposure to TRAIL sustained resistance, demonstrating a component of induced survival signaling leading to transient acquired resistance to TRAIL. Based on these results we propose that TRAIL treatment leads to a transient adaptation in survivor cells that can be sustained in cells exposed to long-term TRAIL treatments, leading to acquired resistance. Minimizing the impact of cell-to-cell variability on TRAIL-mediated killing will thus require appropriate spacing of stimuli as well as the use of additional agents that inhibit pro-survival pathways.

In order to propagate a solid tumor, cancer cells must adapt to and survive under various tumor microenvironment (TME) stresses, such as hypoxia or lactic acidosis. To systematically identify genes that modulate cancer cell survival under stresses, we performed genome-wide shRNA screens under hypoxia or lactic acidosis. We discovered that genetic depletion of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA or ACC1) or ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) protected cancer cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Additionally, loss of ACLY or ACC1 reduced levels and activities of the oncogenic transcription factor ETV4. Silencing ETV4 also protected cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis and led to remarkably similar transcriptional responses as with silenced ACLY or ACC1, including an anti-apoptotic program. Metabolomic analysis found that while a-ketoglutarate levels decrease under hypoxia in control cells, a-ketoglutarate is paradoxically increased by hypoxia when ACC1 or ACLY are depleted. Supplementation with a-ketoglutarate rescued the hypoxia-induced apoptosis and recapitulated the decreased expression and activity of ETV4 via an epigenetic mechanism. Therefore, ACC1 and ACLY regulate the levels of ETV4 under hypoxia via increased a-ketoglutarate. These results reveal that ACC1/ACLY- a-ketoglutarate-ETV4 is a novel means by which metabolic states regulate transcriptional output for life vs. death decisions under hypoxia. Since many lipogenic inhibitors are under investigation as cancer therapeutics, our findings suggest that the use of these inhibitors will need to be carefully considered with respect to oncogenic drivers, tumor hypoxia, progression and dormancy. More broadly, our screen provides a framework for studying additional tumor cell stress-adaption mechanisms in the future. DESIGN: H1975 lung cancer cells transduced with a scramble shRNA hairpin or two different shRNAs against ACLY, ACC1, or ETV4 under hypoxia.",

Trypanosoma cruzi is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that causes human Chagas' disease, a leading cause of heart failure in Latin America. Using Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays we screened phenotypically diverse human cells (foreskin fibroblasts, microvascular endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells) for a common transcriptional response signature to T. cruzi. A common feature was a prominent type I interferon response, indicative of a secondary response to secreted cytokines. Using transwell plates to distinguish cytokine-dependent and -independent gene expression profiles in T. cruzi-infected cells, a core cytokine-independent response was identified in fibroblasts and endothelial cells that featured metabolic and signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, amino acid catabolism and response to wounding. Significant downregulation of genes involved in mitotic cell cycle and cell division predicted that T. cruzi infection impedes cell cycle progression in the host cell. Primary human foreskin fibroblasts and human microvascular endothelial cells were grown in transwell dishes to reach 80% confluency. The cells in the bottom of the transwell were infected with T. cruzi for 24 hours, while the cells on the top of the transwel were not infected but exposed to the same culture medium bathing the infected cells.

Purpose: The hepatoblasts are found to be optimal stage, compared with hepatic stem cells (hHpSCs) and mature hepatocytes (hHeps). To identify the cellular determinants that correlated with HCV infection during hES cells' differentiation, transcriptome profiling of cells at hHpSC, hHB, PreHep and hHep stages were compared with RNA sequencing.Results: In general, the gene expression profile of cells at each stage clustered closer to the HCV infected cells at the same stages. The genes involved in regulation of liver development were up-regulated along with processes of maturation. Among the genes positively related to HCV replication, ABCB6, CEBPD, TNFRSF10C, GTF3A, HAS1, UBE2J1 were highly expressed in mature hHeps, while IGFBP6, SMAD6, ITGA7 etc. were highly expressed in progenitor hHB stage.

Families of viral restriction factors reported involved in HCV infection were significantly enriched in hHeps. Conclusions: HCV does not change the transcription profile of induced cells and use different genes to support HCV replication in the cells from different stage.

Adipogenesis is induced by treating confluent preadipocytes with the adipogenic cocktail, which activates transcription factors (TFs) glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and CREB within minutes and increases expression of TFs C/EBPb/d, KLF4 and Krox20 within hours. All of these TFs have been shown to be capable of promoting adipogenesis in culture when they are overexpressed. However, it has remained unclear whether endogenous KLF4 and Krox20 are required for adipogenesis in culture and in vivo. Using conditional knockout mice and derived white and brown preadipocytes, we show that endogenous KLF4 and Krox20 are dispensable for adipogenesis in culture and brown adipose tissue development in mice.

This combination of pre-existing and Notch-promoted loops coalesce enhancers and promoters to form highly interacting clusters, termed \"3D cliques\". Notch preferentially activates enhancers and promotes looping interactions within highly connected 3D cliques that regulate key oncogenes.Conclusions: These observations suggest a general mechanism that oncogenic transcription factors can exploit to regulate the transcriptional outputs of cancer cells.

The transcriptomes of hESFtroph at days 8, 10, and 12 had the greatest consistency with TE. Among genes coding for secreted proteins of the TE of human blastocysts and of hESCtroph are several molecules known to be involved in the implantation process as well as novel ones, such as CXCL12, HBEGF, inhibin A, DKK3, Wnt 5A, follistatin.

Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is the most prevalent form of human prion disease and it is characterized by the presence of neuronal loss, spongiform degeneration, chronic inflammation and the accumulation of misfolded and pathogenic prion protein (PrPSc). The molecular mechanisms underlying these alterations are largely unknown, but the presence of intracellular neuronal calcium (Ca+2) overload, a general feature in models of prion diseases, is suggested to play a key role in prion pathogenesis. Here we describe the presence of massive regulation of Ca+2 responsive genes in sCJD brain tissue, accompanied by two Ca+2-dependent processes: endoplasmic reticulum stress and the activation of the cysteine proteases Calpains 1/2. Pathogenic Calpain activation in sCJD is linked to the cleavage of their cellular substrates, impaired autophagy and lysosomal damage, which is partially reversed by Calpain inhibition in a cellular prion model. Calpain 1 treatment enhances seeding activity of PrPSc in a prion conversion assay. Neuronal lysosomal impairment caused by Calpain over activation leads to the release of the lysosomal protease Cathepsin S that in sCJD mainly localises in axons. Additionally, massive Cathepsin S overexpression is detected in microglial cells. Alterations in Ca+2 homeostasis and activation of Calpain-Cathepsin axis already occur at pre-clinical stages of the disease as detected in a humanized sCJD mouse model. Altogether our work indicates that unbalanced Calpain-Cathepsin activation is a relevant contributor to the pathogenesis of sCJD at multiple molecular levels and a potential target for therapeutic intervention. To identify differentially expressed genes during development of sCJD pathology we analysed the expression levels in the cortical region of tg340-PRNP129MM mice infected with sCJD MM1 brain homogenates at pre-clinical (120 dpi) and clinical (180 dpi) stages.",

The respiratory epithelium is the body's first line of defense to pathogens, pollutants, and other potentially injurious agents that can be inhaled. Sampling the upper respiratory tract is becoming a widely used technique in the clinic to examine the molecular changes in the diseased airway; however, it is unclear as to whether the responses in the upper respiratory tract (i.e. the nasal turbinates) reflect the changes that occur in the lower respiratory tract (i.e. trachea and lungs). Here, we assessed the responses to poly I:C, a synthetic double-stranded RNA molecule that is meant to mimic the acute effects of a viral infection, in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts of cynomolgus macaques. To do this, we compared the in vivo response after a nasal poly I:C challenge in a nasal scrape samples (performed using a nasal curette) to responses that occurred after ex vivo poly I:C stimulation in nasal scrapes, tracheal epithelial brushings, and lung tissue explants in non-human primates. Animals were sedated with ketamine (10-15 mg/kg) delivered i.m. For nasal scrapes, a nasal curette was used to take a sample from the nasal cavity (blind, but likely to be from the inferior/maxilloturbinate). After sedation, the left nasal cavity was sampled at T = 0. Saline or poly I:C (100 mg) was subsequently administered to the right nasal cavity using a Penn-Century microspray device. At T = 6h post-poly I:C administration animals were sedated once more and a nasal scrape was collected from the nasal turbinates in the right nasal cavity. For these studies, each treatment group had n = 12 non-human primates and within each treatment group there were n = 6 that were sensitized and n = 6 that were not sensitized to A.suum. 2 samples were removed as outliers (detected by PCA).",

    "text": "Gene Expression profiling in DBA/2J glaucoma. Glaucoma is a common ocular disorder that is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. It is characterized by the dysfunction and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Although many studies have implicated various molecules in glaucoma, no mechanism has been shown to be responsible for the earliest detectable damage to RGCs and their axons in the optic nerve. Here, we show that the leukocyte transendothelial migration pathway is activated in the optic nerve head at the earliest stages of disease in an inherited mouse model of glaucoma. This resulted in proinflammatory monocytes entering the optic nerve prior to detectable neuronal damage. A 1-time x-ray treatment prevented monocyte entry and subsequent glaucomatous damage. A single x-ray treatment of an individual eye in young mice provided that eye with long-term protection from glaucoma but had no effect on the contralateral eye. Localized radiation treatment prevented detectable neuronal damage and dysfunction in treated eyes, despite the continued presence of other glaucomatous stresses and signaling pathways. Injection of endothelin-2, a damaging mediator produced by the monocytes, into irradiated eyes, combined with the other glaucomatous stresses, restored neural damage with a topography characteristic of glaucoma. Together, these data support a model of glaucomatous damage involving monocyte entry into the optic nerve. Genome-wide assessment of gene expression changes was performed in DBA/2J-Gpnmb+, DBA/2J mice and irradiated DBA/2J mice at 8.5 and 10.5 months of age. In this study (Howell et al, JCI, 2012), 50 samples (10 D2-Gpnmb+ control at 8.5 mos, 20 NOE DBA/2J at 8.5 mos, 10 radiation-treated DBA2J at 8.5 mos and 10 radiation-treated DBA/2J at 10.5 mos) were combined with 30 of ONH samples from the GSE26299 study (10 D2-Gpnmb+ and 20 NOE DBA/2J all at 10.5 mos).

Sorafenib is the only approved targeted drug for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its effect on patients' survival gain is limited and varies over a wide range depending on patho-genetic conditions. Thus, enhancing the efficacy of sorafenib and finding a reliable predictive biomarker are crucuial to achieve efficient control of HCCs. In this study, we employed a systems approach by combining transcriptome analysis of the mRNA changes in HCC cell lines in response to sorafenib with network analysis to investigate the action and resistance mechanism of sorafenib. Gene ontology and gene set analysis revealed that proteotoxic stress and apoptosis modules are activated in the presence of sorafenib. Further analysis of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress network model combined with in vitro experiments showed that introducing an additional stress by treating the orally active protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) inhibitor (PACMA 31) can synergistically increase the efficacy of sorafenib in vitro and in vivo, which was confirmed using a mouse xenograft model. We also found that HCC patients with high PDI expression show resistance to sorafenib and poor clinical outcomes, compared to the low PDI expression group. These results suggest that PDI is a promising therapeutic target for enhancing the efficacy of sorafenib and can also be a biomarker for predicting sorafenib responsiveness. Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells and subjected to RT-PCR analysis. HCC cell lines (SNU761, Huh7, Hep3B and HepG2) were treated with sorafenib 3 mM for 24 hours, while the control group was treated with only DMSO.",

We reveal extensive and previously uncharacterized dynamic processes and molecular signatures in gene expression, as well as specific patterns of alternative splicing, and novel regulators for specific stages of male germ cell development.

    "text": "Comparison of the MC-LR and MC-RR effects on Caco-2 cells. Microcystins (MCs) are cyclic hepatotoxins produced worldwide by various species of cyanobacteria. Their structure includes two variable amino acids (AAs) and most of the studies focused on the most toxic variant: the microcystin LR (MC-LR). However, more than 80 MC variants have been described to date. Despite ingestion being the major pathway of human exposure, few in vivo studies have demonstrated macroscopic effects on the gastro-intestinal tract, but no data are available on the affected pathways by several variants on intestinal cells. Here, using a non-selective method, we investigated for the first time the effect of MC-RR and MC-LR on the human intestinal cell line Caco-2 and compared their response at the pangenomic scale. The cells were incubated for 4 hrs or 24 hrs with the same range of sub-lethal concentrations of MC-RR or MC-LR.Low effects were observed for both variants after a short-term exposure. On the contrary, dose-dependent modulations of the genes transcription levels were noticed with MC-RR and MC-LR after 24 hrs. Furthermore, the genomic profiles induced by both variants were similar suggesting a common toxicity mechanism but with higher modulation following MC-LR than MC-RR exposure. However, the functional annotation revealed major differences between the variants effects. Indeed, the well-known MC-LR affected mainly two pathways, the oxidative stress response and the cell cycle regulation, which did not elicit significant alteration following MC-RR exposure.This work is the first comparative description of the MC-LR and MC-RR effects on a human intestinal cell model. It allowed us to suggest differences in the mechanism of toxicity for MC-RR and MC-LR. These results illustrate that the toxicity of MC variants remains a key point for risk assessment. Differentiated Caco-2 cells were exposed to microcystins in free FCS culture medium for either 4 or 24 hours. Sub-lethal concentrations of 10, 50 and 100 uM of MC-LR or MC-RR were chosen for 4 hours, while 1, 5 and 10 uM were selected for 24 hours. For each condition (including the controls), the solvent concentration was fixed to 2% EtOH for MC-LR and 1.5% of 80% MeOH for MC-RR. Four to five culture replicates per condition were done.",

Obesity leads to a state of chronic low-grade inflammation that features accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in adipose tissue. Here, we determined the role of macrophage lipid droplet accumulation in the development of obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation, using mice with myeloid-specific deficiency of the lipid-inducible HILPDA protein. HILPDA deficiency markedly reduced intracellular lipid levels and accumulation of fluorescently-labeled fatty acids. Decreased lipid storage in HILPDA-deficient macrophages could be rescued by inhibition of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and was associated with increased oxidative metabolism. In diet-induced obese mice, HILPDA deficiency did not alter inflammatory and metabolic parameters, despite markedly reducing lipid accumulation in macrophages. Overall, we find that HILPDA is a lipid-induced physiological inhibitor of ATGL-mediated lipolysis in macrophages that uncouples lipid storage in adipose tissue macrophages from inflammation and metabolic dysregulation.

We identified about 1500 novel lncRNAs, a number of which were differentially expressed in obese mice. The expression of two lncRNAs highly enriched in beta-cells, blinc2 and blinc3, correlated to body weight gain and glycaemia levels in obese mice and was also modified in diabetic db/db mice. The expression of both lncRNAs was also modulated in vitro in isolated islets cells by glucolipotoxic conditions. Moreover, the expression of the human orthologue of blinc3 was altered in the islets of type 2 diabetic patients and was associated to the BMI of the donors. Modulation of the level of blinc2 and blinc3 by overexpression or downregulation in MIN6 and mouse islets cells, did not affect insulin secretion but increased beta-cell apoptosis.

In this study, we analyze germline DNA whole-exome sequencing (WES) data from 38 families with strong CRC aggregation without alterations in known hereditary genes to detect rare candidate CNVs to CRC predisposition using ExomeDepth and CoNIFER tools. Variants shared between family members were compared to Database of Genomic Variants (DGV) catalogue and our Spanish database. CNVs finally selected were validated and segregation analysis were performed using Comparative Genome Hybridization (CGH). Gene expression arrays and qRT-PCR were conducted in both germline and tumor cDNA to check possible effects at transcription level. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies were also carried out. Whith this, 21 candidate CNV corresponding to 16 duplications and 5 deletions were detected by calling tools. After multiple filtering steps, only the duplication in chromosome 1 in family 7 stood out as interesting. Validation by CGH confirmed the duplication and correct family segregation. TTF2, TRIM45, VTCN1 and miR942 are embedded in chromosome 1 duplication.

Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of death in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and intracranial aneurysm (ICA) causing subarachnoid hemorrhage is among the most serious complications. The diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for ICAs in ADPKD have not been fully established. We here generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from seven ADPKD patients, including four with ICAs. The vascular cells differentiated from ADPKD-iPSCs showed altered Ca2+ entry and gene expression profiles compared with those from control-iPSCs. We found that the expression level of a metalloenzyme gene, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1, was specifically elevated in the iPSC-derived endothelia from ADPKD patients with ICAs. Furthermore, we confirmed a statistically significant correlation between the serum MMP1 levels and the development of ICAs in 354 ADPKD patients, indicating that the serum MMP1 levels may be a novel risk factor and become more beneficial when combined with other risk factors. These results suggest that cellular disease models with ADPKD-specific iPSCs can be used to study the disease mechanisms and to identify novel disease-related molecules or risk factors. The gene expression profiles of vascular endothelia and smooth muscle cells derived from control- and ADPKD-iPSCs were analyzed. Seven control-iPSC derived endothelial cells (ECs), seven ADPKD-iPSC derived ECs, ten control-iPSC derived vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and seven ADPKD-iPSC derived SMCs were analyzed.",

Several human pathologies are characterized by deregulated angiogenesis and unstable blood vessels. Solid tumours, for instance, get their nourishment from newly formed structurally abnormal vessels which present wide and irregular inter-endothelial junctions. Expression and clustering of the main endothelial-specific adherens junction protein, vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin (VEC), upregulate genes with key roles in endothelial differentiation and stability.Objective: We aim at understanding the molecular mechanisms through which VEC triggers the expression of a set of genes involved in endothelial differentiation and vascular stabilization.Methods and Results: We compared a VEC-null cell line with the same line reconstituted with VEC wild type cDNA. VEC expression and clustering upregulated endothelial-specific genes with key roles in vascular stabilization including claudin-5, Vascular Endothelial-Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (VE-PTP) and von Willebrand factor (vWf). Mechanistically VEC exerts this effect by inhibiting Polycomb protein activity on the specific gene promoters. This is achieved by preventing nuclear translocation of FoxO1 and b-catenin, which contribute to Polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2) binding to promoter regions of claudin-5, VE-PTP and vWf. VE-cadherin/b-catenin complex also sequesters a core subunit of PRC2 (Ezh2) at the cell membrane, preventing its nuclear translocation. Inhibition of Ezh2/VE-cadherin association increases Ezh2 recruitment to claudin-5, VE-PTP and vWf promoters, causing gene downregulation. RNAseq comparison of VEC-null and VEC-positive cells suggested a more general role of VE-cadherin in activating endothelial genes and triggering a vascular stability-related gene expression program. In pathological angiogenesis of human ovarian carcinomas, reduced VEC expression paralleled decreased levels of Claudin-5 and VE-PTP. Conclusions: These data extend the knowledge of Polycomb-mediated regulation of gene expression to endothelial cell differentiation and vessel maturation. The identified mechanism opens novel therapeutic opportunities to modulate endothelial gene expression and induce vascular normalization through pharmacological inhibition of the Polycomb-mediated repression system.

Although TRM express little T-bet and Eomesodermin, transcription factor signatures revealed that multiple drivers of effector gene expression are active in TRM, including Notch.

The maintenance of advanced malignancies relies on continued activity of driver oncogenes, although their rate-limiting role is highly context-dependent with respect to tumor types and associated genetic alterations. Oncogenic Kras mutation is the signature event in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), serving a critical role in tumor initiation. Here, an inducible KrasG12D-driven p53 mutant PDAC mouse model establishes that advanced PDAC remains strictly dependent on continued KrasG12D expression and that KrasG12D serves a vital role in the control of tumor metabolism, through stimulation of glucose uptake and channeling of glucose intermediates through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Notably, these studies reveal that oncogenic Kras regulates ribose biogenesis. Unlike canonical models of PPP-mediated ribose biogenesis, we demonstrate that oncogenic Kras drives intermediates from enhanced glycolytic flux into the non-oxidative arm of the PPP, thereby decoupling ribose biogenesis from NADPNADPH-mediated redox control. Together, this work provides in vivo mechanistic insights into how oncogenic Kras promotes metabolic reprogramming in native tumors and illuminates potential metabolic targets that can be exploited for therapeutic benefit in Kras-driven PDAC. Primary pancreatic tumor lines were established from p48Cre tetO_LKrasG12D ROSA_rtTAL+ p53L+ mice.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the accumulation of CD5+ B lymphocytes in peripheral blood, lymphoid organs and BM. The main feature of the disease is accumulation of the malignant cells due to decreased apoptosis. CD84 belongs to the Signaling Lymphocyte Activating Molecule (SLAM) family of immunoreceptors, and has an unknown function in CLL cells. Here, we show that the expression of CD84 is significantly elevated from the early stages of the disease, and is regulated by macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and its receptor, CD74. Activation of cell surface CD84 initiates a signaling cascade that enhances CLL cell survival. Both immune-mediated neutralization or blockade of CD84 induce cell death in vitro and in vivo. In addition, analysis of samples derived from an on-going clinical trial, in which human subjects were treated with humanized anti-CD74 milatuzumab shows a decrease in CD84 mRNA levels milatuzumab-treated cells. This downregulation was correlated with reduction of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 message.

Macrophages play a key role in both innate and adaptive immunity, but our knowledge on the changes in transcription regulation that occurs during their differentiation from monocytes is still limited. In this study, we used a meta-analysis followed by a systems biology approach for the identification of differentially expressed genes between monocytes and macrophages and possible regulators of these changes in transcription. Based on the pattern of gene expression change, transcription regulator analysis predicted a decrease in Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone 3 lysine 27 methyl transferase, activity after differentiation of monocytes into macrophages. This inhibition was validated by a significant decrease in trimethylated H3K27 during differentiation of both human primary monocytes into macrophages and the THP-1 cell line into macrophage-like cells. Overexpressing EZH2 during differentiation of monocytes and THP-1 cells obstructs cellular adhesion, thus preventing the first step in differentiation. Another facet of macrophage differentiation is the cessation of proliferation, and inhibition of EZH2 by the small molecule inhibitor GSK126 in THP-1 cells indeed impedes proliferation. This study shows an important part for epigenetic changes during monocyte differentiation. It highlights the role of EZH2 activity behind the changes needed in adhesion and proliferation mechanisms for macrophage formation.

Triple negative cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer usually associated with poor outcome and lack of benefit from target therapy. A pathway analysis in a microarray study was performed using TNBC compared with non-triple negative breast cancer (non-TNBC). Overexpression of several Wnt pathway genes, such as frizzled homolog 7 (FZD7), Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) and transcription factor 7 (TCF7) has been observed in TNBC. Focus was given to the Wnt pathway receptor, FZD7. To validate its function, inhibition of FZD7 using FZD7shRNA was carried out. Notably decreased cell proliferation, suppressed invasiveness and colony formation in triple negative MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 cells were observed. Mechanism study indicated that these effects occurred through silencing the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, as evidenced by loss of nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and decreased transcriptional activity of TCF7. In vivo study revealed that FZD7shRNA significantly suppressed the tumor formation in xenotransplation mice due to decrease cell proliferation.

The sensation of light is initiated in photoreceptor cells by the photoisomerization of a chromophore molecule from 11-cis to all-trans retinal. Continuous visual perception requires recycling of the spent chromophore back to the 11-cis form through the visual cycle, a series of reactions in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). Light-driven chromophore consumption by photoreceptors is greater in daytime compared to night time, suggesting that correspondingly higher activity of the visual cycle may be required. On the other hand, as rod photoreceptors are saturated in bright light, the continuous turnover of their chromophore through the visual cycle during daytime would unnecessarily utilize precious energy and produce toxic byproducts. Here, we sought to determine whether the recycling of chromophore and the dark adaptation of rods is regulated by the circadian clock and light exposure. We demonstrate that in melatonin-proficient C3H/f+/+ mice, rod dark adaptation is slower during the day or after light exposure. This surprising daytime downregulation of the RPE visual cycle was further demonstrated by gene analysis, which revealed light-driven reduction in the expression of Rpe65, which encodes a key enzyme of the RPE visual cycle. In contrast, rods in melatonin-deficient strains (C57BL6/J and 129/Sv) were not affected by this daily visual cycle modulation. Our results demonstrate that the circadian clock and light exposure regulate the recycling of chromophore in the RPE visual cycle. This daily modulation of rod dark adaptation is mediated by melatonin and could potentially protect the retina from light-induced damage during the day. mRNA-seq of murine eyes (lens removed) in objective day (OD) vs. subjective day (SD) conditions (2 biological replicates per condition).

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Intestinal mononuclear phagocytes (MNP) are phenotypically similar, but have different functions. Macrophages contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To understand this contribution it is necessary to distinguish macrophages from other MNPs, and identify functionally-different macrophage populations. We aimed to accurately identify intestinal macrophage populations, and to ascertain their functions in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).METHODS: We developed 12-parameter flow cytometry protocols to identify and characterise human intestinal MNPs. We then used RNA sequencing, qPCR, and flow cytometry to analyse colonic biopsies from patients with CD, UC, or non-inflamed controls, in a cross-sectional study.RESULTS: We unambiguously differentiate macrophage populations (CD45+CD64+ HLA-DR+) from dendritic cells (CD45+CD64- HLA-DR+ CD11c;). We identify two distinct subsets within the macrophage population, differentiated by their expression of the mannose receptor, CD206. Further examination of these macrophage sub-populations showed that CD206+ macrophages expressed markers consistent with a mature macrophage phenotype: high levels of CD68 and CD163, higher transcription of IL-10 and lower expression of Trem1. On the contrary, CD64+ HLA-DR- CD206- cells appear to be semi-mature intermediaries in the development of mature intestinal macrophages from their monocyte precursors.CONCLUSIONS: We identified and purified MNP and macrophage populations from human intestinal lamina propria. Thorough characterisation reveals that human colonic macrophages appear to be derived from a monocytic precursor with high CCR2 and low CD206 expression. As these cells mature they lose their proliferative properties and acquire expression of IL-10, CD206, CD63, and CD168. Targeting the newly recruited monocyte-derived cells may represent a fruitful avenue to ameliorate chronic inflammation in IBD.

Ptf1a has been shown to be necessary for determining an inhibitory interneuronal fate in many regions of the nervous system. In this study, we aim to investigate the sufficiency of Ptf1a to cell-autonomously promote a specific neuronal identity by misexpressing it in developing excitatory cortical pyramidal cells and studying its impact on pyramidal cell features, such as its gene expression profile. To accomplish this, we electroporate either a Ptf1a/GFP-misexpression construct or a GFP-only control construct into E12.5 mouse embryonic cortices, harvest the cortices at E15.5, and examine Ptf1a-induced changes to the pyramidal cell transcriptome, molecular expression pattern, neurotransmitter status, and morphology. We conclude that Ptf1a is sufficient to cell-autonomously promote an inhibitory peptidergic identity and alter neuronal morphology in developing cortical pyramidal cells. The results of this study provide insight into intrinsic transcriptional controls over neuronal identity, specifically implicate Ptf1a as a potent regulator of an inhibitory peptidergic identity, and may guide future studies of neuronal reprogramming for circuit repair after disease or injury. Purified GFP-expressing cells were isolated from mouse embryonic cortices electroporated with either a Ptf1a/GFP-misexpressing construct or a GFP-only control construct. 3-6 brains were collected per sample, yielding 58-106,000 cells per sample. Ptf1a/GFP-misexpressing samples were run in triplicate, GFP-only control samples were run in duplicate.",

Natural Killer (NK) cells are the first lymphocyte population to reconstitute early after non myelo-ablative and T cell-replete haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (h-HSCTs) with post-transplant infusion of cyclophosphamide. The present study characterizes the transient and predominant expansion starting from the 2nd week after h-HSCT of a donor-derived unconventional subset of CD56dim/CD16neg (uCD56dim) NK cells expressing remarkable high levels of NKG2A and low levels of NKp46. Both transcription and phenotypic profiles indicated that uCD56dim NK cells are a distinct NK cell subpopulation with features of late differentiation, yet retaining proliferative capability and functional plasticity to generate conventional CD56bright/CD16pos NK cells in response to IL-15 plus IL-18. uCD56dim NK cells represent by far the largest NK cell subset detectable in the following 7 weeks after h-HSCT and they also express high levels of the activating receptors NKGD and NKp30 as well as of the lytic granules Granzyme-B and Perforin. Nonetheless, uCD56dim NK cells displayed a defective cytotoxicity that could be reversed by blocking the inhibitory receptor CD94/NKG2A. These data open new important perspectives to better understand the ontogenesis/homeostasis of human NK cells and to develop a novel immune-therapeutic approach by targeting the inhibitory NKG2A check point, thus enhancing NK cell alloreactivity early after h-HSCT.

To increase our understanding of psoriasis, we utilized RNA-seq to assay the transcriptomes of skin samples from 3 Tnip1+/+ and 3 Tnip1-/- mice that were treated for two days with imiquimod (IMQ) and performed cross-species analyses with human transcriptome data derived from psoriasis patients and healthy subjects (GSE54456). Intriguingly, the vast majority of genes deregulated in Tnip1-/- mice correlated with their human counterparts, substantiating the interpretation that gene deregulation in Tnip1-/- mice reflects a psoriasis-specific pattern rather than being the consequence of an overall exaggerated inflammatory skin response. Together, the data demonstrate that loss of Tnip1 function leads to genetic susceptibility against IMQ, akin to human disease. As expected, gene ontology (GO) analysis highlighted gene sets known to be affected in psoriasis, such as epidermal development, immune/ defense response, proteolysis and response to wounding.

Recurrent early pregnancy loss (REPL) has multiple etiologies, including endometrial dysregulation leading to \"suboptimal\" implantation. Although the implantation process is tightly regulated in Eutherian (placental) mammals, the molecular factors contributing to dysregulated endometrial gene expression patterns in women with REPL are largely unknown. We hypothesized that genes that gained novel expression in the endometria of mammals that evolved in the Eutherian stemlineage, coincident with the evolution of pregnancy, are likely essential for establishment and maintenance of normal pregnancy and are, therefore, good candidates for genes whose expression may be dysregulated in disorders such as REPL. To test this hypothesis, we took an evolutionary forward genomics approach to characterize gene expression profiles of midsecretory endometria from women with REPL associated with abnormal endometria based either on histology or molecular expression of cyclin E. We identified 58 genes that were differentially expressed (P<0.001) between women with out-of-phase histological dating vs normal histology, and 81 genes that were differentially expressed (P<0.001) between women with abnormally elevated cyclin E levels vs normal cyclin E. Remarkably, genes that were recruited into endometrial expression during the evolution of pregnancy in Eutherian mammals were significantly enriched for dysregulated genes (P=0.002 for histology, P=0.021 for cyclin E), as well as for immune and signaling pathways with essential roles in endometrial biology. Thus, our novel evolutionary-based forward genomics approach identified genes whose dysregulation during the mid-secretory phase likely contributes to the molecular etiologies of recurrent early pregnancy loss. Total RNA obtained from mid luteal phase endometrium (two replicates per biopsy) from women with recurrent early pregnancy loss (REPL). Endometrial gene expression levels were compared 1) between women with out-of-phase (n=10) and normal histological dating (n=22), 2) between women with abnormally elevated (n=9) and normal (n=23) cyclin E levels.

Williams Syndrome (WS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by heterozygous deletions in a chromosome 7q11.23 region typically encompassing 26-28 genes. WS patients exhibit a wide spectrum of symptoms, including cardiovascular disease, intellectual disability, visuospatial deficits and hypersociability a behavioral profile that contrasts with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the relationship between neuropsychiatric phenotypes and dysregulated gene networks caused by the 7q11.23 deletion is unknown. We report results from a large-scale integrated transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood in clinically evaluated subjects with WS, ASD and matched controls. We identified significantly differential expressed genes in WS as compared with ASD or controls, even after removing genes spanning the 7q11.23 region. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we found that three co-expression modules were upregulated in WS, and were significantly associated with the intermediate phenotypes such as anxiety and attention problems. Notably, these three co-expression modules were only composed of genes located outside of 7q11.23 critical region. One module was associated with immune systems and B cell proliferation. Its top hub gene, BCL11A, is implicated in ASD and chromatin modification. Another module was enriched with genes associated with astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and the third module was associated with RNA processing and neurons. MicroRNA (miRNA) profiling revealed differentially expressed miRNAs whose targets were enriched in each co-expression module associated with WS. These results identify genes and potential driver miRNAs, located outside of 7q11.23 critical region, that are novel candidates for mediating the neuropsychiatric phenotypes in WS.

Ginkgo biloba leaf extract (GBE) has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine and today is used as an herbal supplement for various indications such as improving neural function, anti-oxidant and anti-cancer effects. As part of the herbal supplement industry, these compounds are largely unregulated, and may be consumed in large concentrations over extended periods of time. This is of particular concern, because the long-term effects in terms of toxicity and carcinogenicity data is lacking for many herbal products, including GBE. The 2-year B6C3F1 mouse carcinogenicity bioassay indicated a marked dose-related increase in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development associated with exposure to GBE. We have shown that the mechanism of this increase in tumorigenesis is related to a marked increase in the incidence of b-catenin mutation, and report a novel mechanism of constitutive b-catenin activation through post-translational modification leading to constitutive Wnt signaling and unregulated growth signaling and oncogenesis. Furthermore, using global gene expression profiling, we show that GBE-induced HCC exhibit overrepresentation of gene categories associated with human cancer and HCC signaling including upregulation of relevant oncogenes and suppression of critical tumor suppressor genes, as well as chronic oxidative stress, a known inducer of calpain-mediated degradation and promoter of hepatocarcinogenesis in humans. These data provide a molecular mechanism to GBE-induced HCC in B6C3F1 mice that is relevant to human cancer, and provides relevant molecular data that will provide the groundwork for further risk assessment of unregulated compounds, including herbal supplements.

We undertook DNA methylation microarray analysis on monozygotic and dizygotic twins who were discordant for AMD and identified methylated IL17RC promoters as being present only in non-AMD control individuals rather than in AMD patients. We validated this finding of a significantly decreased level of methylation on the IL17RC promoter in AMD siblings as well as in a case control study involving 202 genetically unrelated AMD patients and 96 controls (95% CI, 0.03-0.17, P=3.1x10-8).

To gain better insight into the underlying mechanisms, we analyzed genome-wide gene expression profiles of day 6.5 postimplantation mouse embryos cloned from three different cell types (cumulus cells, neonatal Sertoli cells and fibroblasts). The embryos retrieved from the uteri were separated into embryonic (epiblast) and extraembryonic (extraembryonic ectoderm and ectoplacental cone) tissues and were subjected to gene microarray analysis. Genotype- and sex-matched embryos produced by in vitro fertilization (IVF) were used as controls. Principal component analysis revealed that whereas the gene expression patterns in the embryonic tissues varied according to the donor cell type, those in extraembryonic tissues were relatively consistent across all groups. Within each group, the embryonic tissues had more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (> 2-fold vs. controls) than did the extraembryonic tissues (P < 1.0 x 10-26). In the embryonic tissues, one of the common abnormalities was upregulation of Dlk1, a paternally imprinted gene. This might be a potential cause of the occasional placenta-only conceptuses seen in SCNT-generated mouse embryos (1-5% per embryo transferred in our laboratory), because dysregulation of the same gene is known to cause developmental failure of embryos derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. There were also some DEGs in the extraembryonic tissues, which might explain the poor development of SCNT-derived placentas at early stages, although these alterations were not always statistically significant for all three SCNT groups because of variability. These findings suggest that SCNT affects the embryonic and extraembryonic development differentially and might cause further deterioration in the embryonic lineage in a donor cell-specific manner. This could explain donor cell-dependent variations in cloning efficiency using SCNT. Comparative gene expression analyses using E4.0 cloned blastocysts were performed by microarray. Cloned embryos were produced with cumulus cells by two different methods (cell fusion and nuclear injection).

Aberrant DNA methylation (5mC) is one of the key characteristics of many cancers including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) has anti-cancer therapeutic potential, but its clinical efficacy is currently hindered by dose-limiting side effects. Here we investigated the potential use of DAC in the treatment of HNSCC and show that its efficacy is primarily dependent on the ability of DAC to demethylate DNA. In order to establish whether HNSCC cells can be sensitized to DAC, a panel of 100 generic drugs were screened in combination with DAC. While the 100-drug panel did not sensitise DAC-resistant HNSCC cell lines to DAC treatment, the screen identified that paracetamol (acetaminophen), valproic acid and zinc acetate significantly enhanced DAC efficacy in the DAC-responsive cell lines. DAC and paracetamol were established to work in synergy, allowing DAC to be used at therapeutically relevant low doses (below 500nM). The mechanisms underlying the DAC-paracetamol synergy are multifactorial and encompass both effects of DAC on paracetamol action (alterations in the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway and mimicry of paracetamol overdose) as well as decreased DNA methylation by paracetamol. Therefore, we propose DAC to be a potential therapeutic in a subset of HNSCC patients with its efficacy significantly increased by use of the common analgesic paracetamol. The DAC-paracetamol synergy should also be considered in cancers with an approved DAC treatment regime. There are four RNA-seq samples. VU40T squamous cell cacrcinoma cells were treated for 96h with 500nM 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC), 132.3mM Paracetamol (Para), or both and compared to the untreated cells (control).

Human genetic studies have identified the neuronal RNA binding protein, Rbfox1, as a candidate gene for autism spectrum disorders. While Rbfox1 functions as a splicing regulator in the nucleus, it is also alternatively spliced to produce cytoplasmic isoforms. To investigate cytoplasmic Rbfox1, we knocked down Rbfox proteins in mouse neurons and rescued with cytoplasmic or nuclear Rbfox1. Transcriptome profiling showed that nuclear Rbfox1 rescued splicing changes induced by knockdown, whereas cytoplasmic Rbfox1 rescued changes in mRNA levels. iCLIP-seq of subcellular fractions revealed that in nascent RNA Rbfox1 bound predominantly to introns, while cytoplasmic Rbox1 bound to 3' UTRs. Cytoplasmic Rbfox1 binding increased target mRNA stability and translation, and overlapped significantly with miRNA binding sites. Cytoplasmic Rbfox1 target mRNAs were enriched in genes involved in cortical development and autism. Our results uncover a new Rbfox1 regulatory network and highlight the importance of cytoplasmic RNA metabolism to cortical development and disease. In this data set, we included the data from RNA-seq experiments. We performed RNA-seq to profile gene expression and splicing changes. The expression levels of Rbfox1 and Rbfox3 in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons were reduced by siRNAs.

    "text": "Testicular germ cell tumor susceptibility genes from the consomic 129.MOLF-Chr19 mouse strain . Chromosome substitution strains (CSS or consomic strains) are useful for mapping phenotypes to chromosomes. However, huge efforts are needed to identify the gene(s) responsible for the phenotype in the complex context of the chromosome. Here, we report the identification of candidate disease genes from a CSS using a combination of genetic and genomic approaches as well as by using knowledge about the germ cell tumor disease etiology. We utilized the CSS, 129.MOLF-Chr 19 chromosome substitution strain (or M19), in which males develop germ cell tumors of the testes at an extremely high rate. We are able to identify 3 protein-coding genes and 1 microRNA on chromosome 19 that have previously not been implicated to be testicular tumor susceptibility genes. Our findings suggest that changes in gene expression levels in the gonadal tissues of multiple genes from Chr 19 likely contribute to the high TGCT incidence of the M19 strain. Our data advances the use of CSS to identify disease susceptibility genes and demonstrates that the 129.MOLF-Chr 19 strain serves as a useful model to elucidate the genetics and biology of germ cell transformation and tumor development. For gene expression profiling, we used male gonads from different developmental stages, E13.5 and PN1, from the M19 and 129 strains. The idea was to detect the common gene expression changes in the gonads at stages when germ cells are known to transform to embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. E13.5 stage was chosen because tumor development is reported to start around E13.5 in 129 strains (Stevens 1973b; Stevens and Hummel 1957). PN1 stage gonads were chosen because our studies with M19;Oct4-GFP mice, as described above, showed that both germ cells and EC cells are present at this stage suggesting that germ cell transformation may also be ongoing at this stage in the testes of M19 strain. We also compared gene expression differences in gonads to that of embryos to determine whether gene expression differences are specific to the gonads. Our goal was to identify gene(s) whose expression is consistently changed in the gonads at E13.5 and PN1 in the M19 as these would likely be candidate TGCT susceptibility gene(s).Fig. 3A indicates the 3 different tissue samples collected from the M19 and 129 strains: gonads (genital ridges) dissected from male E13.5 embryos and from PN1 mice and male embryos at E13. Because tumor incidence in M19 is approximately 80% we anticipated that gene expression changes could be masked because ~20% of cells/tissues within a sample may have normal levels of gene expression or 20% of the testes may have normal gene expression. Moreover, the amount of RNA extracted from a single genital ridge or PN1 testis is insufficient for a microarray experiment. To minimize the effect of individual samples and to isolate sufficient RNA for microarray analysis from these small sized gonads, we pooled RNA from multiple samples (Table 1). Six RNA pooled samples were prepared (Fig.3A and Supplementary Table 2): E13.5 gonad RNA from males of 129 (129-GR) and M19 (M1-GR); PN1 testes RNA from 129 (129-NBT) and M19 (M1-NBT); E13.5 embryo RNA from males of 129 (129-E) and M19 (M1-E). The six RNA samples were hybridized to six Affymetrix mouse genome genechips individually. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed a dendrogram in which gene expression profiles of the same tissue type clustered together (Fig. 3B). Profiles of the gonads, E13.5 and PN1, were related more closely than to those of embryos. Comparison of the expression profiles of E13.5 gonads from M19 and 129 revealed 10 genes with more than a 2-fold difference in expression levels (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table 3A). Six of the 10 genes mapped to Chr 19. For the PN1 testes, 266 genes showed significant fold changes between the two strains and of these 13 genes mapped to Chr 19 (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table 3C). For the E13.5 embryos, 35 genes showed greater than a 2-fold change in expression between the M19 and 129 and 5 out of 35 genes mapped to Chr 19 (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table 3B). By analyzing the data of differentially expressed genes present in the 3 samples, as well as selecting those that map to Chr 19, we were able to exclude a majority of the genes but found 3 genes in common. The 3 genes map to Chr 19 and were found to be downregulated in the M19 strain E13.5 and PN1 gonads as well as E13.5 embryos. These are Zfp162, D19Bwg1357e and Cox15. These 3 genes have not been previously implicated in testicular tumorigenesis and are novel TGCT candidate susceptibility genes. .",

Intronic and intergenic long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging gene expression regulators. The molecular pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is still poorly understood, and in particular, limited studies are available for intronic lncRNAs expressed in RCC. Microarray experiments were performed with two different custom-designed arrays enriched with probes for lncRNAs mapping to intronic genomic regions. Samples from 18 primary clear cell RCC tumors and 11 nontumor adjacent matched tissues were analyzed with 4k-probes microarrays. Oligoarrays with 44k-probes were used to interrogate 17 RCC samples (14 clear cell, 2 papillary, 1 chromophobe subtypes) split into four pools. Meta-analyses were performed by taking the genomic coordinates of the RCC-expressed lncRNAs, and cross-referencing them with microarray expression data from three additional human tissues (normal liver, prostate tumor and kidney nontumor samples), and with large-scale public data for epigenetic regulatory marks and for evolutionarily conserved sequences. A signature of 29 intronic lncRNAs differentially expressed between RCC and nontumor samples was obtained (false discovery rate (FDR) <5%). An additional signature of 26 intronic lncRNAs significantly correlated with the RCC five-year patient survival outcome was identified (FDR <5%, p-value <=0.01). We identified 4303 intronic antisense lncRNAs expressed in RCC, of which 25% were cis correlated (r >|0.6|) with the expression of the mRNA in the same locus across three human tissues. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of those loci pointed to 'regulation of biological processes' as the main enriched category. A module map analysis of all expressed protein-coding genes in RCC that had a significant (r >=|0.8|) trans correlation with the 20% most abundant lncRNAs identified 35 relevant (p <0.05) GO sets. In addition, we determined that 60% of these lncRNAs are evolutionarily conserved. At the genomic loci containing the intronic RCC-expressed lncRNAs, a strong association (p <0.001) was found between their transcription start sites and genomic marks such as CpG islands and histones methylation and acetylation. Intronic antisense lncRNAs are widely expressed in RCC tumors. Some of them are significantly altered in RCC in comparison with nontumor samples. The majority of these lncRNAs is evolutionarily conserved and possibly modulated by epigenetic modifications. Our data suggest that these RCC lncRNAs may contribute to the complex network of regulatory RNAs playing a role in renal cell malignant transformation. A total of 22 human kidney tissue samples consisting of 11 primary renal tumors and 11 matched adjacent nontumor tissues from clear cell renal cell carcinmoa (RCC) patients were evaluated in this study. We compared the expression profiles of tumor and non-tumor samples obtained from patients with clear cell RCC to evaluate a possible correlation of the lncRNAs with renal malignancy. The set of clear cell RCC expression profiles was generated using a custom-designed cDNA microarray platform with 4,608 unique elements in replicate (9,216) enriched in gene fragments that map to intronic regions of known human genes (GPL3985).",

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) are the major primary liver cancers in adults. It has been shown the phenotypic overlap between HCC and CC, comprising continuous liver cancer spectrum. As a proof of concept, a recent study has demonstrated a genomic subtype of HCC expressing CC-like gene expression trait, i.e. CC-like HCC, which has revealed common genomic trait of stem cell-like property and aggressive clinical outcome. However, the histopathological characteristics of these intermediate phenotype was not fully evaluated yet. Here, we found that a variant HCC with fibrous stromal component, i.e. scirrhous HCC, has CC-like genomic features. By performing gene expression profiling and immunohistochemical evaluation, we compared the morphological and molecular features of scirrhous HCC with CC and classical HCC. We found that the scirrhous HCC express both CC-like and stem cell-like expression traits. In addition, we observed the expression of core epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes, which may contribute to the aggressive behavior of scirrhous HCC. Over-expression of transforming growth factor b (TGF-b) signaling was also found, implying its regulatory role in the pathobiology of scirrhous HCC. Conclusion: We suggest that the fibrous stromal component in HCC may contribute to the acquisition of CC-like gene expression trait in HCC. The expression of stem cell-like trait and TGF-b/EMT molecules may play pivotal roles in the aggressive phenotype of scirrhous HCC.

The host immune response plays a critical role not only in protection from human leishmaniasis, but also in promoting disease severity. Although candidate gene approaches in mouse models of leishmaniasis have been extremely informative, a global understanding of the immune pathways active in lesions from human patients is lacking. To address this issue, genome-wide transcriptional profiling of Leishmania braziliensis-infected cutaneous lesions and normal skin controls was carried out. A signature of the L. braziliensis skin lesion was defined that includes over 2,000 differentially regulated genes. Pathway-level analysis of this transcriptional response revealed key biological pathways, as well as specific genes, associated with cutaneous pathology, generating a testable 'metapathway' model of immune-driven lesion pathology, and providing new insights for treatment of human leishmaniasis. Thirty-five skin biopsies were analyzed, including 10 normal skin biopsies (2 from North America and 8 from non-endemic area in Brazil), and 25 skin lesion biopsies (8 early cutaneous lesions, 17 late cutaneous lesions) obtained from Leishmania brazilensis-infected patients presenting at the Corte de Pedra Health Post in Corte de Pedra, Bahia, Brazil.",

    "text": "Study of gene expression alteration in male androgenetic alopecia: evidence of predominant molecular signaling pathways. Background: The male androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most common form of hair loss in men and is hereditary in more than 80% of cases and characterized by a distinct pattern of progressive hair loss starting from the frontal area and the vertex of the scalp. Although several genetic risk loci have been identified, relevant genes for AGA remain to be identified. Objectives: Herein, molecular biomarkers associated with premature AGA were identified through gene expression analysis using cDNA generated from scalp skin vertex biopsies of hairless/bold men with premature AGA and healthy volunteers. Results: This monocentric study reveals that genes encoding mast cell granule enzymes, inflammatory and immunoglobulin-associated immune mediators were significantly over-expressed in AGA. In contrast, under-expressed genes appear to be associated with the Wnt/b-catenin and BMP/TGF-b signaling pathways. Although the involvement of these pathways in hair follicle regeneration is well-described, functional interpretation of the transcriptomic data highlights different events that account for their inhibition. In particular, one of these events depends on the dysregulated expression of proopiomelanocortin (POMC), as confirmed by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. In addition, a lower expression of CYP27B1 in AGA patients supports that alteration of vitamin D metabolism contributes to hair loss. Conclusion: Altogether, this study provides evidence for distinct molecular events contributing to alopecia that might be targeted for new therapeutic approaches. monocentric study of scalp punch biopsy from AGA patients and healthy donors.",

Hair follicles (HF) and BCCs can be regarded as ordered and disordered skin appendages respectively and may utilize similar molecular mechanisms of growth. We wanted to examine the similarities and differences in gene expression patterns between BCCs and HF to define common growth mechanisms and gene expression patterns that distinguish an ordered skin appendage from a disordered skin growth. Nodular BCCs (n= 8) and non-follicular skin epithelium (n=8) were obtained. Scalp hair follicle root sheath was micro dissected from between the sebaceous gland duct and the lower one third of the HF (n=7). Microarray analysis was performed using 21K cDNA arrays and selected genes were validated using qPCR and histochemistry staining. Two differentially expressed gene sets were identified by significance analysis of microarray (SAM) in BCC and HF verses skin epithelium respectively. Based on these two lists, we conducted multiple signaling pathway analyses. The results indicated that Notch, hedgehog, and WNT signaling pathways were involved in regulating formation of both HF and BCCs. However, Notch signaling, including tumor suppressor genes Notch 1, Notch 2, Jagged ligands (JAG 1, 2), notch signaling inhibitor NUMB, Lunatic Fringe (LFNG), Deltex proteins (DTX 1, 2) which serve as important signaling components downstream of Notch, and Notch target genes HES1 ,RBPSUHL, hairless protein and HES7, all showed selective differential activation in BCCs compared to HF. The components of the notch signaling pathway may be potential new targets in the development of new therapeutic approaches to BCCs. samples of human hair follicles (n=7) were collected from scalp biopsies of normal individuals undergoing cosmetic procedures while nodular BCCs (n=8) and normal skin (n=8) were obtained from patients undergoing surgical resection. Only patients that had not been treated with preoperative chemotherapy or other therapeutic approaches were selected. All samples were provided by the Department of Dermatology and Skin Science, University of British Columbia with approval from the University Clinical Research Ethics Board. Hair follicles were microdissected to remove the lower one third, including the hair bulb, leaving the root sheaths including the bulge region. Normal skin samples were microdissected to isolate skin epithelium from the dermal component. All nodular BCC samples and normal skin epithelium were taken from the facial area of donors.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of HD provide an opportunity to study the mechanisms underlying disease pathology in patient tissues relevant to disease. Murine studies have demonstrated that HTT is intricately involved in corticogenesis, and mutant (mt) HTT cannot compensate for the loss of non-CAG-expanded HTT. However, the critical effect of mtHTT in human corticogenesis has not yet been specifically explored and due to inherent differences in cortical development and timing between humans and mice. We therefore differentiated HD and non-diseased iPSCs into functional cortical neurons. While HD patient iPSCs can be successfully differentiated towards a cortical fate in culture, the resulting neurons display transcriptomic, morphological and functional phenotypes indicative of altered neurodevelopment. This is the first demonstration of altered corticogenesis from HD human patient cells, further supporting the potential neurodevelopmental aspect of HD.

We previously found that heavy membrane cholesterol burden promotes amyloid precursor protein (APP) endocytosis and processing, leading to increased amyloid-A) secretion. We hypothesized that such an increase of cholesterol could trigger sporadic AD. We thus acutely loaded the plasma membrane of neurons in culture with cholesterol to reach the 30 % increase observed in AD brains. We showed by multiplex electro-chemiluminescence immuno-assay that transient membrane cholesterol loading produced a significant increase of A42 secretion. We also found that early endosomes were enlarged and more prone to aggregation using confocal and electron microscopy and that APP vesicular transport in neuronal processes was slowed down using fluorescence live-imaging. In addition, treatment of neurons with cholesterol induced changes in gene expression profile that are reminiscent of early AD. This model of membrane cholesterol increase in cultured neurons reproduces most of early AD changes and could thus be relevant for deciphering early mechanisms and design new targets for sporadic AD. . In this study, we loaded the plasma membrane of neurons with 30% more cholesterol and observed the effects on gene expression.

We show that Glis3 is expressed in gonocytes, SSCs and SPCs, but not in differentiated spermatogonia or subsequent stages of spermatogenesis nor in Sertoli or Leydig cells. We further demonstrate that Glis3-deficiency causes a severe impairment in spermatogenesis in mice. Although the number of gonocytes was slightly diminished in Glis3KO testis, the number undifferentiated, PLZF+ spermatogonia was dramatically reduced leading to a virtual block in the progression of spermatogenesis. Gene expression profiling showed that the expression of a number of genes associated with self-renewal and differentiation of spermatogonial cells was significantly decreased in 1-week-old Glis3KO2 testis. These included a set of GDNF-dependent genes, such as Etv5, Bcl6b, Lhx1, Brachyury, Id4, and Pou3f1, and GDNF-independent genes, such as FoxO1, Oct4, and Zbtb16.

A multi-omic approach in a clinical experimental study identified circulating biomarkers reflecting glucocorticoid exposure.Background: Endogenous glucocorticoids (GC) are mechanistically linked to common diseases and are important as drugs in the treatment of many disorders. There is no marker that can measure and quantify GC action. Our aim was to identify circulating biomarkers of GC action using a clinical experimental study. Methods: In a randomized, crossover, single-blind trial, subjects with primary adrenal insufficiency received intravenous hydrocortisone infusion in a circadian pattern (physiological GC exposure) or isotonic saline (GC withdrawal) over 22 hours. Samples were collected at 7 AM (end of infusion). Integrated multi-omic analysis was used because of the complexity in GC action and the low number of subjects. The transcriptome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and adipose tissue, plasma miRNAomic, and serum metabolomics were compared between the interventions. Replication of the plasma miRNA findings was performed in three independent studies. Results: During GC withdrawal, overnight urinary cortisol and cortisone excretion were undetectable. Correlation and hypernetwork analyses identified a transcriptomic profile derived from PBMCs and adipose tissue predictive of GC exposure, and a multi-omic cluster predictive of GC exposure. From the circulating 'omic data, decreased expression of plasma miR-122-5p was associated with increased GC exposure. This finding was reproduced in three independent studies. Conclusion: We developed a human experimental model for physiological GC exposure and withdrawal. The integrated multi-omic data identified circulating miRNAs and metabolites associated with GC-responsive genes. In independent studies, miR-122-5p was shown to be associated with GC exposure.

Further data showed that fenretinide was able to induce apoptosis in CD34+ CML cells which were refractory to imatinib. Through transcriptome analysis and followed by molecular validation, we further showed that apoptosis induced by fenretinide in CD34+ CML cells was mediated by complex mechanisms of stress responses, probably triggered by elevated levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Thus, fenretinide combines with imatinib may represent a new strategy for the treatment of CML, in which fenretinide targets primitive CD34+ CML cells whereas imatinib targets leukemic blasts. This strategy may eventually reduce the risk of relapse and probably resistant as well in CML patients. Transcriptome profiles of CML CD34+ cells with and without fenretinide treatment were analyzed using whole genome expression arrays (Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0) in four CML patients (CML32, CML33, CML34 and CML35, see Table 1). To minimize potential data biases, both treated and untreated cell samples were maintained in culture for 48 hours before hybridization.",

Here, we asked whether we could identify pharmacological agents that enhance endogenous stem cell function to promote skin repair, focusing on SKPs (skin-derived precursors) a dermal precursor cell population. Libraries of compounds already used in humans were screened for their ability to enhance the self-renewal of human and rodent SKPs. We identified and validated 5 such compounds, and showed that two of them, alprostadil and trimebutine maleate, enhanced the repair of full thickness skin wounds in middle-aged mice. Moreover, SKPs isolated from drug-treated skin displayed long-term increases in self-renewal when cultured in basal growth medium without drugs. Both alprostadil and trimebutine maleate likely mediated increases in SKPs self-renewal by moderate hyperactivation of the MEK-ERK pathway. These findings identify candidates for potential clinical use in human skin repair, and provide support for the idea that pharmacological activation of endogenous tissue precursors represents a viable therapeutic strategy. We obtained three independent isolates of SKPs from 9 month old CD57/Bl6 mice which were either uninjured and treated with vehicle, injured and treated with vehicle, trimebutine maleate, or alprostadil.

The prime focus of the current therapeutic strategy for Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an early and deep tumour burden reduction; this characterizes and defines the complete response (CR). To date, no description of the characteristics of the plasma cells (PC) prone to achieve CR has been reported. This study aimed at the molecular characterization of PC derived from MM patients who achieved CR after bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone (VTD) first line therapy.One hundred and eighteen MM primary tumours obtained from homogeneously treated patients were globally profiled both for gene expression and for single nucleotide polymorphism genotype. Genomic results were used to obtain a predictor of sensitivity to VTD induction therapy, as well as to describe both the transcription and the genomic profile of PC derived from patients with MM who will respond optimally to primary induction therapy.By analysing the gene profiles of CR patients, we identified a 5-gene signature predicting CR with an overall median accuracy of 75% (range: 72%-85%). In addition, we highlighted the differential expression of a series of genes, whose deregulation, accordingly to their reported functions, might explain the CR patients' sensitivity to VTD therapy. We also showed that a small copy number loss, covering 606Kb on chromosome 1p22.1 was the most significantly associated with CR patients.The study provides insights into the genomic landscape of PC obtained from newly diagnosed MM patients achieving CR after VTD and shows that patients might be accurately stratified according to their sensitivity to VTD. 118 samples have been analyzed; the homogeneity of samples has been ensured by the immunomagnetic enrichment procedure: only >90% pure CD138+ cells have been employed.Response to vtd therapy (provided in each sample record);CR: complete responsenCR: near complete responseVGPR: Very good partial responsePR: partial responseSD: Stable disease.",

Clear cell sarcoma (CCS) is an aggressive soft tissue malignant tumor characterized by a unique t(12; 22) translocation, leading to the expression of a chimeric EWS/ATF1 fusion gene. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying how EWS/ATF1 is involved in the development of CCSs. In addition, the cells of origin for CCSs remain to be determined. We generated EWS/ATF1-inducible mice, and examined the effects of EWS/ATF1 expression in adult cells. We show that the forced expression of EWS/ATF1 results in the development of EWS/ATF1-dependent sarcomas in mice. The histology of EWS/ATF1-induced sarcomas resembles that of CCSs and EWS/ATF1-induced tumor cells express CCS-markers, such as S100, Sox10, and Mitf. A lineage tracing experiment revealed that such sarcomas are derived from neural crest-lineage cells. Finally, we found that EWS/ATF1 directly induces Fos in an ERK-independent manner, and demonstrated that the increased Fos expression is important for the active cell proliferation in not only EWS/ATF1-induced sarcomas, but also in human CCSs. Our results indicate that FOS, as well as EWS/ATF1 itself, could be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of EWS/ATF1-related sarcomas. Tumor cell lines were exposed to different concentrations of doxycycline, and total RNAs were isolated at 24 hours after the doxycycline exposure. Total RNAs were also isolated directly from a tumor developed in a EWS/ATF1-inducible mouse given doxycycline for 3 months.

Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) varies in characteristics even in early stages and is mainly classified into three subtypes, which are superficial, exophytic and endophytic types, based on a macroscopic appearance of tumor growth.Of these subtypes, endophytic tumor has a poorer prognosis because of its invasive feature and higher frequency to have metastasis. To understand a molecular mechanism of endophytic subtype and identify biomarkers, we performed comprehensive microarray analysis for mRNAs from clinical biopsy sampleswhich were classified into subtypes and found overexpression of parvin-beta (PARVB) gene significantly related to endophytic type. PARVB is known to play a critical role in actin reorganization and focal adhesions. Knocking down PARVB expression in vitrocaused apparent decreases in cell migration and wound healing, implying that PARVB has a crucial role in cellular motility. Moreover, metastasis-free survival was significantly lowered in patients with higher PARVB expression. Therefore overexpression of PARVB is a candidate biomarker for endophytic tumor and metastasis and may be clinically applicable for decision making of an adjuvant therapy in TSCC.

Very little is known regarding how hormonal exposures impact the epigenetic landscape of developing tissues in the context of a whole organism, in contrast to the impact on cultured cells. Here we took a global approach to understanding how neonatal exposure to the xenoestrogen, diethylstilbestrol (DES), alters the uterine epigenome. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq (H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K27ac and H3K4me1) were performed on DES-treated and control uteri. The most striking finding was differential association of H3K27ac and H3K4me1 at typical and super-enhancer regions of 79% of altered genes. These peaks overlapped with previously reported estrogen receptor a (ERa) ChIP-seq peaks. Conditional uterine deletion of ERa (Esr1cKO) conferred protection of 88% of altered genes. H3K27ac ChIP-seq on Esr1cKO samples showed that 72% of protected genes had a differential H3K27ac enhancer. These data suggest that DES regulates gene expression in the neonatal mouse uterus by H3K27ac association at ERa binding sites near estrogen-regulated genes. Mice were treated neonatally with DES (1 mg/kg) on days 1-5 and uteri collected on PND5, 4 hrs after the last treatment. Each sample is from a single uterus.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents the most clinically challenging subtypes of breast cancer for which targeted therapeutics are still lacking. Bromodomain and Extra Terminal (BET) proteins, including ubiquitously expressed BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and testis-specific BRDT, are epigenetic \"readers\" and play a major role in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. BET proteins have emerged as new therapeutic targets for human cancer and other diseases. Based upon a new class of BET bromodomain (BRD) inhibitor, BETi-211, we have developed a highly selective and potent BET protein degrader, BETd-246. In comparison, BETd-246 is much more potent and effective than the corresponding BET inhibitor BETi-211 in growth inhibition and apoptosis induction in TNBC cell lines, indicating critical differences between these two different BET targeting approaches in their regulation of gene transcription. To understand the mechanisms of actions of BETi-211 and BETd-246 in TNBC, we performed RNA-seq analysis on MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468. These cell lines were treated for 3 h to capture the early transcriptional responses to BETi-211 or BETd-246. RNA-seq analysis reveals that BETd-246 predominantly down-regulates the expression of a large number of genes whereas BETi-211 up- and down-regulates an approximately equal number of genes in TNBC cells. Critically, transcriptomic analysis uncovers that a set of proliferation and survival-related genes, including MCL1 and BRD2, were oppositely regulated by BETd-246 and BETi-211 in these TNBC cell lines. Global gene transcription profiling was performed in MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines treated with DMSO, Thalidomide (1000 nmol/L), BETi-211 (1000 nmol/L) or BETd-246 (100 nmol/L) for 3 hours.

Inhibition of ZNF768 function was achieved by conditional over expression expression of the C-terminal zinc finger of ZNF768 for 12h. For preparation of total RNA cells were resuspended in TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) at 0.9Mio/ml and snap-frozen. After thawing RNA was extracted from 0.4ml of TriZol lysate using the direct-zol RNA Miniprep (Zymo Research, Irvine CA, USA) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was assessed for purity by UV-vis spectrometry (Nanodrop) and for integrity by Bioanalyzer (Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent, Santa Clara USA)). RNA was of high purity (abs. 260/280 >1.9, abs 269/239>2.1) and integrity (Bioanalyzer RIN>9 ) and thus used for further processing. For production of RNA-seq libraries total RNA was DNAse treated (dsDNAse, Fermentas) and 100 ng of this RNA was processed with a strand-specific protocol (RNA-seq complete kit, NuGEN, San Carlos, USA). In brief the RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA with a reduced set of hexamer primers, avoiding excessive representation of rRNA in the cDNA. Second strand cDNA synthesis was done in presence of dUTP. After ultrasonic fragmentation of the cDNA and end repair, Illumina-compatible adapter were ligated. Adapters contained uracil in one strand, allowing complete digestion of the second-strand derived DNA. After strand selection the libraries were amplified, assessed for correct insert size on the Agilent Bioanalyser and diluted to 10nM. Barcoded libraries were mixed in equimolar amounts and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq1500 in single-read mode with a read length of 100 b. ZNF768-deltaN.",

Dengue is one of the most important arboviruses in the world, with 2.5 billion people living in areas under risk to contagious. Mosquitos from Aedes genus is the transmission vector of viral particles.The virus genome inserted in these particles is formed by a single strain of RNA molecule which codifies three structural (C, prM, and E proteins) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5).The NS3 protein is involved in viral replication, with helicase (NS3hell) and protease functions. Once inoculated, the primary target for dengue virus (DV) infection is the Dendritic Cells (DC) in the site of mosquitos bit.The Dendritic Cells is the most efficient antigen-presenting cell holding the connection of innate immune system with adaptive immune system. In this study we examined the response of human monocyte-derived DC (mdDCs) DV-infected with two different strains how contain a single point mutation in L435S or L480S position of NS3hell protein, named vBAC-NS3435 and vBAC-NS3480 respectively.The analysis of these results demonstrated that the mutated strains can infect more efficiently the mdDCs compared with parental virus (vBACDV1) with more percentage of cells infected, replication and virus progeny.Infections of mdDCs with mutated DV can induce a differentiated response in gene profile of theses cells, with up-regulation of IFN Signaling and PRR canonical pathways. In the PRR pathway the expression of TLR3 and TLR7 was determined and these seem to be the route of sensing of the ssRNA-virus for the infected mdDCs. These sensing of the DV by mdDCs is translated in production of Type I IFN.The Type I IFN production was more important in mdDC DV-infected with mutated strains compared with parental strain. However, the enhanced levels of Type I IFN production were unable to prevent mdDCs infection by mutated strains.A18:J192replication. In the absence of Type I IFN action, the percentage of mdDCs infected by mutated strains was significantly incremented compared with DV-infection in the presence of Type I IFN, demonstrating that the Type I IFN action was effective but not sufficient to prevent viral replication of mutated strains. The single point mutation in NS3hell protein of vBAC-NS3435 and vBAC-NS3480 are sufficient to enhance the replication and bypass the Type I IFN action. All these results together can demonstrated that the single point mutation in a NS3hel protein of DV can subvert the normal replication pathway of the virus and these change can't by controlled by human mdDC production of Type I IFN. In this study we analyzed the mRNA pool of 10 cultures. Each culture was infected with MOI of 5.0, and the cells were extracted at the times points of 8, 24, and 48 hours after infection.As infection control, the same 10 cultures were mock-infected.

    "text": "Skeletal muscle PGC-1a mediates mitochondrial, but not metabolic, changes during calorie restriction. Calorie restriction (CR) is a dietary intervention that extends lifespan and healthspan in a variety of organisms. CR improves mitochondrial energy production, fuel oxidation and reactive oxygen species scavenging in skeletal muscle and other tissues, and these processes are thought to be critical to the benefits of CR. PGC-1a is a transcriptional coactivator that regulates mitochondrial function and is induced by CR. Consequently, many of the mitochondrial and metabolic benefits of CR are attributed to increased PGC-1a activity. To test this model for the first time, we examined the metabolic and mitochondrial response to CR in mice lacking skeletal muscle PGC-1a (MKO). Surprisingly, MKO mice demonstrated a normal improvement in glucose homeostasis in response to CR, indicating that skeletal muscle PGC-1a is dispensable for the whole-body benefits of CR. In contrast, gene expression profiling and electron microscopy demonstrated that PGC-1a is required for the full CR-induced increases in mitochondrial gene expression and mitochondrial density in skeletal muscle. These results demonstrate that PGC-1a is a major regulator of the mitochondrial response to CR in skeletal muscle, but surprisingly show that neither PGC-1a nor mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle are required for the metabolic benefits of CR. Control (FLOX) and PGC-1a skeletal muscle specific knock out (MKO) mice were placed on a control diet [C] or a calorie restriction diet [CR] for 12 weeks.

The 3' UTR of messenger RNAs serves as the regulatory region that mediates post-transcriptional control by microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Aside from individual sequence-specific binding and regulation, examples of interaction between these factors at particular 3' UTR sites have emerged in recent studies. However, the whole picture of such higher-order regulatory modules across the transcriptome is lacking. Here, we investigate the interactions between HuR, a ubiquitous RBP, and Ago2, a core effector of the miRNA pathway, at the transcriptome-wide level. Using HITS-CLIP, we map HuR and miRNA binding sites on human 3'UTRs and assess their co-occurrence. Additionally, we demonstrate global effects of HuR knockdown on Ago2 occupancy, suggesting a co-regulatory relationship. Focusing on sites of Ago2-HuR overlap, 13 candidates were screened in luciferase reporter assays, compared to miRNA site mutant controls. Eleven of the sites showed a repressive activity, which displayed significant de-repression upon subsequent testing of the reporters in Dicer-null cells, substantiating miRNA dependence. To experimentally test for HuR's role in co-regulation, we tested the reporters in CRISPR-generated HuR KO cells. Three of the miRNA sites demonstrated altered activities, indicating that HuR has an effect on miRNA repression at those sites.

Adult neurogenesis, found in two neurogenic regions of the brain, has profound roles in neural plasticity and brain function. A hallmark feature of neurodegeneration is neuroinflammation, which can either enhance or inhibit neurogenesis depending on the context of the brain microenvironment. The consequences of deficient DNA repair in adult neurogenesis and neuroinflammation are poorly understood despite their potential relevance for homeostasis. We previously reported that loss of NEIL1, an important DNA glycosylase involved in DNA base excision repair, is associated with deficiencies in spatial memory, olfaction, and protection against ischemic stroke in mice. Here, we show that Neil1-/- mice display an anxiety-mediated behavior in the open field test, a deficient recognitive memory in novel object recognition and increased neuroinflammatory response under basal conditions. Further, mice lacking NEIL1 have decreased neurogenesis and deficient resolution of neuroinflammation following gamma irradiation (IR)-induced stress compared to WT mice. Neil1-/- IR-exposed mice also exhibit increased DNA damage and apoptosis in the hippocampus. Interestingly, behavioral tests two weeks after IR showed impaired stress response in the Neil1-/- mice. Our data indicate that NEIL1 plays an important role in adult neurogenesis and in the resolution of neuroinflammation. NEIL1 knockout (KO) and wildtype (WT) mice were placed in a stereotaxic cube box in a Nordion Gammacell 40 Exactor Irradiator, and was either subjected to whole body gamma irradiation (6 Gy) delivered at a rate of 0.74 Gy/min (irradiated) or no radiation (sham) on Day 0.

The results were integrated into a database and set of interactive analysis tools, the NCI Transcriptional Pharmacodynamics Workbench (NCI TPW), intended to allow exploration of gene expression modulation, including by molecular pathway, drug target, and association with drug sensitivity. We identified common transcriptional responses across drugs and cell types and uncovered cell signaling pathway-specific gene expression changes associated with drug sensitivity. We also demonstrated the value of this tool for investigating clinically relevant molecular hypotheses, utilizing the NCI TPW to assess drug-induced expression changes in genes associated with immune function and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and to identify candidate biomarkers for drug activity. The NCI TPW provides a comprehensive resource to facilitate understanding of tumor cell characteristics that define sensitivity to anticancer drugs.

Human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) is the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma and is associated with the angioproliferative disorders primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). We have previously described evidence of HHV-8 infection within the pulmonary vasculature of patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH).

HHV-8 infection of HPMVECs resulted in significant changes of gene expression including alterations of pathways integral to both cellular apoptosis and angiogenesis.

Epiblast stem cells (EpiSC) are pluripotent stem cells derived from mouse postimplantation embryos between E5.5 to E7.5, a time window in which gastrulation commences. Therefore, EpiSC represent a valuable tool for studying mammalian postimplantation development in vitro. Beyond their pluripotent features, EpiSC can also be reprogrammed into a mouse embryonic stem cell-like (mESC) state. Published reports showed that EpiSC reversion requires transcription factor overexpression, while others suggest that applying stringent mESC culture conditions alone was sufficient to revert EpiSC to mESC-like cells. In an effort to clarify these discrepancies, we systematically compared a panel of independent EpiSC lines. Indeed, the different lines shared a number of defining EpiSC characteristics such as teratoma formation ability, regardless of the day of isolation from the embryo. However, despite being grown in identical, self-renewal-promoting conditions, some lines displayed strong expression of genes associated with mesendodermal differentiation. Strikingly, these same lines were not revertable to a mESC-like state by applying stringent mESC culture conditions. Moreover, expression of mesendodermal marker genes correlated in a negative manner with the ability to efficiently undergo neural induction. Overall, our data suggest that different EpiSC lines may self-renew in distinct developmental ground states, which has important consequences for functional readouts such as revert ability to a mESC-like state and directed differentiation.For EpiSC lines derivation E5.5 embryos were plated onto irradiated mouse embryonic feeder cells (MEF cells) seeded at low density. Outgrowths were picked and expanded manually. Basal medium consisted of Knock-Out-DMEM, 20% Knock-Out Serum Replacement, Non Essential Amino Acids, L-Glutamine and beta-Mercaptoethanol (all Gibco). For cultivation on feeders 5ng/ml bFGF (Peprotech) was added to the medium to yield EpiSC medium. For preparation of mouse embryonic fibroblast-conditioned medium, EpiSC medium incubated on inactivated MEFs, followed by addition of another 5ng/ml bFGF (CM+). For feeder free culture, EpiSCs were seeded onto FCS-coated dishes. EpiSC were routinely passaged using 1mg/ml Collagenase IV (Invitrogen). Mouse ESC were cultured in standard conditions - Knock-Out-DMEM, 15% Knock-Out Serum Replacement (both Gibco), 5% fetal calf serum (Biowest), Non Essential Amino Acids, L-Glutamine and betaY-Mercaptoethanol (all Gibco), supplemented with either homemade or commercially available LIF (ESGRO) at 1000U/ml. Some experiments were carried out in chemically defined N2B27 medium 11 in the presence of 10ng/ml bFGF.

    "text": "An integrative transcriptomics approach identifies miR-503 as a candidate master regulator of the estrogen response [miRNA-seq]. Estrogen receptor a (ERa) is an important biomarker of breast cancer severity and a common therapeutic target. Recent studies have demonstrated that in addition to its role in promoting proliferation, ERa also protects tumors against metastatic transformation. Current therapeutics antagonize ERa and interfere with both beneficial and detrimental signaling pathways stimulated by ERa. The goal of this study is to uncover the dynamics of coding and non-coding RNA (microRNA) expression in response to estrogen stimulation and identify potential therapeutic targets that more specifically inhibit ERa-stimulated growth and survival pathways without interfering with its protective features. To achieve this, we exposed MCF7 cells (an estrogen receptor positive model cell line for breast cancer) to estrogen and prepared a time course of paired mRNA and miRNA sequencing libraries at ten time points throughout the first 24 hours of the response to estrogen. From these data, we identified three primary expression trends--transient, induced, and repressed--that were each enriched for genes with distinct cellular functions. Integrative analysis of paired mRNA and microRNA temporal expression profiles identified miR-503 as the strongest candidate master regulator of the estrogen response, in part through suppression of ZNF217--an oncogene that is frequently amplified in cancer. We confirmed experimentally that miR-503 directly targets ZNF217 and that over-expression of miR-503 suppresses breast cancer cell proliferation. Overall, these data indicate that miR-503 acts as a potent estrogen-induced tumor suppressor microRNA that opposes cellular proliferation and has promise as a therapeutic for breast cancer. More generally, our work provides a systems-level framework for identifying functional interactions that shape the temporal dynamics of gene expression. Quantification of miRNAs in MCF7 cells responding to estrogen following a period of estrogen starvation.Three independent biological replicates (30 samples: 3 replicates x 10 time points) of MCF7 cells were exposed to 10nM Estradiol for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12 , or 24 hours, and total RNA was extracted from the samples. Total RNA was used to generate paired RNA and miRNA sequencing. The miRNA libraries were prepared using the Bioo Scientific NextFLEX v2 library preparation kit.",

Moreover, a small number of cellular genes were resistant to the host shutoff through both transcriptional and translational regulation, including genes in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway that is important for EV71 replication.

Millions of sweat glands required to maintain body temperature develop from embryonic ectoderm by a poorly defined mechanism. We present evidence for temporal cascade regulation of sweat gland development by Wnt, Eda and Shh pathways. The first stage, sweat gland induction, failed completely when Wnt/b-catenin signaling was blocked in skin epithelium, accompanied by sharp downregulation of Wnt, Eda and Shh pathway genes. In a meta-layer of regulation, Wnt antagonist Dkk4 appeared to operate on sweat gland induction in a negative feedback loop: Dkk4 was itself sharply downregulated in b-catenin-ablated mice, whereas its over-expression repressed Wnt target genes and significantly reduced gland numbers. Eda signaling succeeded Wnt, and activated downstream Shh pathway. Thus, in absence of Eda, Wnt pathway was still active and initial sweat gland pre-germs were seen but failed to develop germs, and dwonstream Shh pathway was repressed. When both Wnt and Eda were intact but Shh was ablated, early stage induction and subsequent duct formation occurred normally, but the final stage formation of secretory coil failed. Thus, sweat gland development shows a relay of regulatory steps, initiated by Wnt/b-catenin -- itself modulated by Dkk4 -- with subsequent tandem action of Eda and Shh pathways.

The progression of 90% or more carcinomas is believed to be mediated by disruption of normal E-cadherin expression, subcellular localization or function. Despite the strong correlation between E-cadherin loss and malignancy the mechanism through how this occurs is not known in most sporadic and hereditary epithelial carcinomas. Previous works have shown the importance of CDH1 intron 2 sequences for proper gene and protein expression supporting the possibility of these being cis-modulators of E-cadherin expression/function. but when co-expressed it led to reduced cell-cell adhesiveness, increased invasion and angiogenesis. By expression array analysis, IFITM1 and IFI27 levels were found to be increased upon CDH1a overexpression.

This project describes the establishment and validation of a murine orthotopic xenograft model using fresh human tumor samples that recapitulates the critical components of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The authors discuss the proven and theoretical advantages of the model as well as future translational implications.Background: Relevant preclinical models that recapitulate the key features of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are needed in order to provide biologically tractable models to probe disease progression and therapeutic responses and ultimately improve patient outcomes for this disease. Here, we describe the establishment and clinical, pathological, molecular and genetic validation of a murine, orthotopic xenograft model of PDAC. Methods: Human PDACs were resected and orthotopically implanted and propagated in immunocompromised mice. Patient survival was correlated with xenograft growth and metastatic rate in mice. Human and mouse tumor pathology were compared. Tumors were analyzed for genetic mutations, gene expression, receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation, and cytokine expression. Results: Fifteen human PDACs were propagated orthotopically in mice. Xenografts developed peritoneal and liver metastases. Time to growth and metastatic efficiency in mice each correlated with patient survival. Tumor architecture, nuclear grade and stromal content were similar in patient and xenografted tumors. Propagated tumors closely exhibited the genetic and molecular features known to characterize pancreatic cancer (e.g. high rate of KRAS, p53, SMAD4 mutation and EGFR activation). The correlation coefficient of gene expression between patient tumors and xenografts propagated through multiple generations was 93 to 99%. Analysis of gene expression demonstrated distinct differences between xenografts from fresh patient tumors versus commercially available PDAC cell lines. Conclusions: Our orthotopic xenograft model derived from fresh human PDACs closely recapitulates the clinical, pathologic, genetic and molecular aspects of human disease. This model has resulted in the identification of rational therapeutic strategies to be tested in clinical trials and will permit additional therapeutic approaches and identification of biomarkers of response to therapy. 47 Samples in total were generated for normal pancreatic tissue in patients, pancreatic tumors in patients, pancreatic tumors propagated in a mouse xenograft model, and pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro.

    "text": "Human Embryoid Body Transcriptomes Reveal Maturation Differences Influenced by Size and Formation in Custom Microarrays. Stem cell differentiation strategies and optimization for generating lineage-specific cells and tissues most frequently rely on a three-dimensional embryoid body (EB) intermediate. We previously applied nanotechnology tools of photolithography to generate custom microarrays that allow high throughput uniform formation of EBs of custom size for precise downstream analysis. Formation of EBs of 200 or 500 micron size revealed distinct morphological differences that are single or multicystic cores, respectively, independent of method of formation from single cells or two-dimensional (2D) clusters. Here we utilize photolithographic array generated EBs to obtain 3D cultures under a standardized platform for transcriptome analysis to compare EB size and the method of EB formation from single cells or mechanically passaged 2D clusters. Our analysis evaluates RNA expression in EBs formed from the human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line WA09 and from ethnically diverse human induced pluripotent stem cell lines (ED-iPSC) of African American and Hispanic Latino ethnicity recently derived in our laboratory. This is the first comprehensive study on EB transcriptomes including multiple size parameters, EB formation methodologies, and ethnicities. Our analysis indicates upregulation of genes involved in wound healing for mechanically passaged cells and of genes for embryonic tube formation in 500 micron multicystic EBs. We propose that EB maturation may be a longer process then previously realized. In addition, the type or extent of maturation possible may be influenced by EB size, with larger EBs capable of more extensive remodeling as revealed by multicystic morphology and initiation of early tube formation pathways while retaining pluripotency status. We anticipate that this information will be broadly useful to the stem cell and bioengineering communities in optimization of tissue engineering with pluripotent stem cells and understanding sources of variation. mRNA profiles by RNA-seq from embryoid bodies generated by different methods.",

There is a need for robust in vitro models to sensitively capture skeletal muscle adverse toxicities early in the research and development of novel xenobiotics. To this end, an in vitro rat skeletal muscle model (L6) was used to study the translation of transcriptomics data generated from an in vivo rat model. Novel sulfonyl isoxazoline herbicides were associated with skeletal muscle toxicity in an in vivo rat model. Gene expression pathway analysis on skeletal muscle tissues taken from in vivo repeat dose studies identified enriched pathways associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, energy metabolism, protein regulation and cell cycle. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress were further explored in an in vitro L6 model. This model demonstrated that the sulfonyl isoxazoline compounds induced mitochondrial dysfunction, mitochondrial superoxide production and apoptosis. These in vitro findings accurately concurred with the in vivo transcriptomics data, thereby confirming the ability of the L6 skeletal muscle model to identify relevant in vivo mechanisms of xenobiotic-induced toxicity. Moreover, these results highlight the sensitivity of the L6 galactose media model to study mitochondrial perturbation associated with skeletal muscle toxicity; this model may be utilised to rank the potency of novel xenobiotics upon further validation.

    "text": "FJ001: Retinoic acid-dependent and -independent gene-regulatory pathways of Pitx3 in meso-diencephalic dopaminergic neurons. Development of meso-diencephalic dopamine (mdDA) neurons requires the combined actions of the orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1 and the paired-like homeobox transcription factor Pitx3. Whereas all mdDA neurons require Nurr1 for expression of Th and survival, dependence on Pitx3 is only displayed by the mdDA subpopulation that will form the substantia nigra (SNc). Previously, we demonstrated that Pitx3-/- embryos lack the expression of the retinoic acid (RA)-generating enzyme Ahd2, which is normally selectively expressed in the Pitx3-dependent DA neurons of the SNc. Restoring RA-signaling in Pitx3-/- embryos revealed a selective dependence of SNc neurons on the presence of RA for differentiation into Th-positive neurons and maintenance throughout embryonic development. Whereas these data are suggestive of an important developmental role for RA in neurons of the SNc, it remained unclear whether other Nurr1 and Pitx3 target genes depend on RA signaling in a manner similar to Th. In search for genes that were affected in Pitx3-deficient mdDA neurons and restored upon embryonic RA treatment, we provide evidence that Delta-like 1, D2R (Drd2) and TH are regulated by Pitx3 and RA signaling, influencing the mdDA terminal differentiated phenotype. Furthermore, we show that regulation of Ahd2-mediated RA-signaling represents only one aspect of the Pitx3 downstream cascade, since Vmat2, Dat, Ahd2 (Aldh1a1), En1, En2 and Cck were unaffected by RA treatment and are (subset) specifically modulated by Pitx3. In conclusion, our data reveal several RA-dependent and -independent aspects of the Pitx3-regulated gene cascade suggesting that Pitx3 acts on multiple levels in the molecular subset-specification of mdDA neurons. RNA was isolated from dissected ventral midbrains of E14.5 Pitx3-/- and Pitx3+/+ mouse embryos. 3 Experimental samples each consisting of 3 Pitx3-/- ventral midbrains were hybridized to reference RNA derived from 10 Pitx3+/+ ventral midbrains.",

Myc oncoproteins directly regulate transcription by binding to target genes, yet this only explains a fraction of the genes affected by Myc. mRNA turnover is controlled via AU-binding proteins (AUBPs) that recognize AU-rich elements (AREs) found within many transcripts. Analyses of precancerous and malignant Myc-expressing B cells revealed that Myc regulates hundreds of ARE-containing (ARED) genes and select AUBPs. Notably, Myc directly suppresses transcription of Tristetraprolin (TTP/ZFP36), an mRNA-destabilizing AUBP, and this circuit is also operational during B lymphopoiesis and IL7 signaling. Importantly, TTP suppression is a hallmark of cancers with MYC involvement, and restoring TTP impairs Myc-induced lymphomagenesis and abolishes maintenance of the malignant state. Further, there is a selection for TTP loss in malignancy; thus, TTP functions as a tumor suppressor. Finally, Myc/TTP-directed control of select cancer-associated ARED genes is disabled during lymphomagenesis. Thus, Myc targets AUBPs to regulate ARED genes that control tumorigenesis.

Sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate, is part of an important group of naturally occurring small molecules with antiinflammatory properties. Even though the published reports are vague, most are best conceivable with an inhibition of T cell functions. We therefore analyzed the effect of SFN on T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Feeding mice with SFN protected from severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Disease amelioration was associated with reduced interleukin (IL)-17 and IFN-gamma expression in draining lymph nodes. In vitro, SFN treatment of T cells did not directly alter T cell cytokine secretion. In contrast, SFN treatment of dendritic cells (DC) inhibited TLR4-induced IL-12 and IL-23 production and the cytokine profile of T cells stimulated by SFN-treated DC. SFN suppressed TLR4-induced nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) activity, without affecting the degradation of its inhibitor (IkB). Instead, SFN treatment of DC resulted in strong expression of the stress response protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which interacts with NFkB p65 and inhibits its activity. Consistent with these findings, HO-1 bound to p65 and subsequently inhibited the p65 promoter activity within the IL23a and IL12b promoter region. Importantly, SFN suppressed Il23a and Il12b expression in vivo and silenced Th17/Th1 responses within the CNS .

These effects are mediated through chemokine receptor CXCR2 and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and are associated with enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, AKT and p38 MAPK. Thus, DEK acts as a hematopoietic cytokine, with potential for clinical applicability.

However, UCB contains an inherently limited HSC count, which is associated with delayed time to engraftment, high graft failure rates and early mortality. 16,16 dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2) was previously identified to be a critical regulator of HSC homeostasis and we hypothesized that a brief ex vivo modulation could improve patient outcomes by increasing the \"effective dose\" of HSCs.Molecular profiling with Affymetrix GeneChips were used to evaluate if increasing the concentration of prostaglandin at 25 and 37 deg C could increase biological responses.

Although p62 was proposed to participate in formation of benign adenomas in autophagy-deficient livers, its role in HCC initiation was not explored.

Transcription factors that bind small DNA motifs embedded in promoters play a central role in controlling gene expression. However, in addition to these elements, up to 70% of genes in higher eukaryotes also have high levels of non-methylated cytosine/guanine base pairs (CpGs) surrounding promoters and gene regulatory units. These features, called CpG islands, were identified over twenty years ago but there remains little mechanistic evidence to suggest how these enigmatic elements contribute to promoter function, with the exception that they are refractory to epigenetic silencing by DNA methylation. Here we show that CpG islands directly recruit the H3K36 specific lysine demethylase enzyme KDM2A. Genome wide analyses by ChIP-seq demonstrated a striking global association of KDM2A with CpG islands. Nucleation of KDM2A at these elements resulted in removal of H3K36 methylation creating CpG island chromatin that is uniquely depleted of this modification. KDM2A utilizes a zinc finger CxxC (ZF-CxxC) domain that specifically recognizes non-methylated CpG DNA and binding is blocked when the CpG DNA is methylated, thus constraining KDM2A to nonmethylated CpG islands. These data expose a remarkably straightforward mechanism through which KDM2A delineates a unique architecture that differentiates CpG island chromatin from bulk chromatin. Two cell lines were used in this study: a control line (LMP) with wildtype levels of KDM2A, and a KDM2A knockdown line (RNAi) in which KDM2A levels were depleted by approximately 60% using an shRNA-based approach. For each cell line, RNA was extracted from cells collected on two different dates (rep1 and rep2).",

One of the most promising approaches for the therapy of these diseases is via the autologous transplantation of RGC or RPE cells derived from the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This emphasizes the importance of detailed characterization and understanding of the mechanisms of differentiation of iPSCs into retinal lineages on the genome-wide scale. Such information can be used to identify novel crucial regulators of differentiation, optimisation of differentiation protocols to make them more efficient and safe, identification of novel specific biomarker signatures of differentiated cells. In this study, we performed the genome-wide transcriptome analysis of terminally differentiated RGC and RPE lineages, as well as intermediate retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) of optic vesicles (OVs) derived from the human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).

ABSTRACT: Furin is a proprotein convertase (PC) responsible for proteolytic activation of a wide array of precursor proteins within the secretory pathway. It maps to the PRC1 locus, a type 2 diabetes susceptibility locus, yet its specific role in pancreatic b cells is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the role of furin in glucose homeostasis. We show that furin is highly expressed in human islets, while PCs that potentially could provide redundancy are expressed at considerably lower levels. b cell-specific furin knockout (bfurKO) mice are glucose intolerant, due to smaller islets with lower insulin content and abnormal dense core secretory granule morphology. RNA expression analysis and differential proteomics on bfurKO islets revealed activation of Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4), which was mediated by mammalian target of rapamycin C1 (mTORC1). bfurKO cells show impaired cleavage of the accessory V-ATPase subunit Ac45, and by blocking this pump in b cells the mTORC1 pathway is activated. Furthermore, bfurKO cells show lack of insulin receptor cleavage and impaired response to insulin. Taken together, these results suggest a model of mTORC1-ATF4 hyperactivation in b cells lacking furin, which causes b cell dysfunction.METHOD: Data obtained for the b cell specific knockout (RIP-Cre+/- furin flox/flox) and control (furin flox/flox) samples were compared to investigate the effect of furin loss on the mRNA profile of islets. Although this method does not directly provide furin targets, the notion of differential gene expression might elucidate affected cellular processes, potentially leading to upstream furin substrates. Islets were isolated from male RIP-Cre+/- furin flox/flox and furin flox/flox mice for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Four biological replicates were used per genotype.",

This makes it an interesting target for mechanistic study and treatment of atherosclerosis.METHODS AND RESULTS:We optimized a promising stilbenoid structure (STX4) in order to reach nanomolar effective concentrations in LXRa reporter-gene assays. STX4 displayed the unique property to activate LXRa effectively but not its subtype LXRb. The potential of STX4 to increase transcriptional activity as an LXRa ligand was tested with gene expression analyses in THP1-derived human macrophages and oxLDL-loaded human foam cells. Only in foam cells but not in macrophage cells STX4 treatment showed athero-protective effects with similar potency as the synthetic LXR ligand T0901317 (T09). Surprisingly, combinatorial treatment with STX4 and T09 resulted in an additive effect on reporter-gene activation and target gene expression. In physiological tests the cellular content of total and esterified cholesterol was significantly reduced by STX4 without the undesirable increase in triglyceride levels as observed for T09.CONCLUSIONS:STX4 is a new LXRa-ligand to study transcriptional regulation of anti-atherogenic processes in cell or ex vivo models, and provides a promising lead structure for pharmaceutical development. 2 treatment groups (STX4 vs. DMSO in foam cells), 3 biological replicates per treatment (6 samples in total), each representing one well from cell culture plate2 treatment groups (STX4 vs. DMSO in macrophages), 4 biological replicates per treatment (8 samples in total), each representing one well from cell culture plate2 treatment groups (T0901317 vs. DMSO in foam cells), 3-4 biological replicates per treatment (7 samples in total), each representing one well from cell culture plate2 treatment groups (T0901317 vs. DMSO in macrophages), 4 biological replicates per treatment (8 samples in total), each representing one well from cell culture plate.",

The conditions of the tumor microenvironment, such as hypoxia and nutrient starvation, play critical roles in cancer progression. However, the role of acidic extracellular pH in cancer progression is not studied as extensively as that of hypoxia. Here, we show that extracellular acidic pH (pH 6.8) triggered activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) by stimulating nuclear translocation and promoter binding to its targets along with intracellular acidification. Interestingly, inhibition of SREBP2, but not SREBP1, suppressed the upregulation of low pH-induced cholesterol biosynthesis-related genes. Moreover, acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2), a direct SREBP2 target, provided a growth advantage to cancer cells under acidic pH. Furthermore, acidic pH-responsive SREBP2 target genes were associated with reduced overall survival of cancer patients. Thus, our findings show that SREBP2 is a key transcriptional regulator of metabolic genes and progression of cancer cells, partly in response to extracellular acidification. Cells were treated for 24 h under each condition. RNA-seq reads were aligned to human transcriptome (UCSC gene) and genome (GRCh37/hg19) references respectively using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner.

We then performed RNA-Seq using renal cortex RNA from C57BL6/J male mice fed either HF or control (Ctrl) diet. We identified 1,134 genes differentially expressed in the cortex on HF vs. Ctrl, of which 31 genes were selected for follow-up analysis. This included the 9 most upregulated, the 11 most downregulated, and 11 genes of interest (primarily sensory receptors and G proteins).

We then examined expression of these 11 genes in Ctrl and HF male heart and liver samples, which demonstrated that these changes are relatively specific to the renal cortex. These 11 genes were also examined in female renal cortex, where we found that the expression changes seen in males on a HF diet are not replicated in females, even when the females are started on the diet sooner to match weight gain of the males.

    "text": "A draft map of cis-regulatory sequences in the mouse genome. The laboratory mouse is the most widely used mammalian model organism in biomedical research. The 2.6 billion bases of the mouse genome share a high degree of conservation with the human genome, so a thorough annotation of the mouse genome will be of significant value to understanding the function of the human genome. To date, most of the functional sequences in the mouse genome have yet to be found, and the cis-regulatory sequences in particular are still poorly annotated. Comparative genomics has been a powerful tool for the discovery of these sequences, but it alone cannot resolve their temporal and spatial functions. Recently, ChIP-Seq has been developed to identify cis-regulatory elements in the genomes of several organisms including human, D. melanogaster and C. elegans. We have applied the same experimental approach to a diverse set of 19 tissues and cell types in the mouse, producing a map of nearly 300,000 murine cis-regulatory sequences. This map provides functional annotation to nearly 11% of the mouse genome, and over 70% of conserved, non-coding sequences (CNS). We define tissue-specific enhancers and identify potential transcription factors regulating gene expression in each tissue or cell type. Finally, we demonstrate that much of the mouse genome is organized into domains of coordinately regulated enhancers and promoters. Our results provide a resource for the annotation of functional elements in the mammalian genome and study of mechanisms regulating tissue-specific gene expression.This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. 19 tissues and primary cell types were examined using ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq.

    "text": "Adipose Rab10 Knockout Causes Insulin Resistance through Impaired Glucose Uptake. Insulin action in adipocytes affects whole-body insulin sensitivity. Studies of adipose-specific Glut4 knockout mice have established that adipose Glut4 contributes to the control of systemic glucose homeostasis. Presumably, this reflects a role for Glut4-mediated glucose transport in the regulation of secreted adipokines. In cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Rab10 GTPase is required for insulin-stimulated translocation of Glut4 (Sano et al., 2007). The physiological importance of adipose Rab10 and the significance of its role in the control of Glut4 vesicle trafficking in vivo are unknown. Here we report that adipocytes from adipose-specific Rab10 knockout mice have a ~50% reduction in glucose uptake and Glut4 translocation to the cell surface in response to insulin, demonstrating a role for Rab10 in Glut4 trafficking. Moreover, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp shows decreased whole-body glucose uptake as well as impaired suppression of hepatic glucose production in adipose Rab10 knockout mice. Thus, fully functional Glut4 vesicle trafficking in adipocytes is critical for maintaining insulin sensitivity. Comparative transcriptome analysis of perigonadal adipose tissue demonstrates significant transcriptional similarities between adipose Rab10 knockout mice and adipose Glut4 knockout mice, consistent with the notion that the phenotypic similarities between the two models are mediated by reduced insulin-stimulated glucose transport into adipocytes.

Genetic studies in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia have uncovered a remarkable complexity of oncogenic and loss-of-function mutations. Amongst this plethora of genetic changes, NOTCH1 activating mutations stand out as the most frequently occurring genetic defect, identified in more than 50% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias, supporting an essential driver role for this gene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia oncogenesis. In this study, we aimed to establish a comprehensive compendium of the long non-coding RNA transcriptome under control of Notch signaling. For this purpose, we measured the transcriptional response of all protein coding genes and long non-coding RNAs upon pharmacological Notch inhibition in the human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CUTLL1 using RNA-sequencing. Similar Notch dependent profiles were established for normal human CD34+ thymic T-cell progenitors exposed to Notch signaling activity in vivo. In addition, we generated long non-coding RNA expression profiles (array data) from GSI treated T-ALL cell lines, ex vivo isolated Notch active CD34+ and Notch inactive CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and from a primary cohort of 15 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with known NOTCH1 mutation status. Integration of these expression datasets with publically available Notch1 ChIP-sequencing data resulted in the identification of long non-coding RNAs directly regulated by Notch activity in normal and malignant T-cell context. Given the central role of Notch in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia oncogenesis, these data pave the way towards development of novel therapeutic strategies that target hyperactive Notch1 signaling in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Despite considerable progress understanding genes that affect the HDL particle, its function, and cholesterol content, genes identified to date explain only a small percentage of the genetic variation. We used N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis in mice to discover novel genes that affect HDL cholesterol levels. Two mutant lines (Hlb218 and Hlb320) with low HDL cholesterol levels were established. Causal mutations in these lines were mapped using linkage analysis: For line Hlb218 within a 12 Mbp region on Chr 10; and for line Hlb320 within a 17 Mbp region on Chr 7. High-throughput sequencing of Hlb218 liver RNA identified a mutation in Pla2g12b. The transition of G to A leads to a cysteine to tyrosine change and most likely causes a loss of a disulfide bridge. Microarray analysis of Hlb320 liver RNA showed a 7-fold downregulation of Hpn; sequencing identified a mutation in the 3' splice site of exon 8. Northern blot confirmed lower mRNA expression level in Hlb320 and did not show a difference in splicing, suggesting that the mutation only affects the splicing rate. In addition to affecting HDL cholesterol, the mutated genes also lead to reduction in serum non-HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Despite low HDL cholesterol levels, the mice from both mutant lines show similar atherosclerotic lesion sizes compared to control mice. These new mutant mouse models are valuable tools to further study the role of these genes, their affect on HDL cholesterol levels, and metabolism. Mutant mice were generated as part of The Jackson Laboratory's Heart, Lung, Blood, and Sleep Disorder Mutagenesis Program by treating male C57BL/6J (B6) mice with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). Third generation (G3) mice were phenotyped to ensure capture of both dominant and recessive mutations. Two unique G3 animals with low HDL cholesterol levels were then used to establish new inbred lines (Hlb218 and Hlb320) by mating them with B6 mice and intercrossing the offspring with low HDL cholesterol for 7 generations. Livers from 3 Hlb218, 3 Hlb320 males, and 6 B6 male controls were obtained for gene expression analysis. The samples were randomized over Illumina Mouse-6 Expression 1.1 BeadChips .",

BACKGROUND: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g (PPAR g) is a nuclear receptor whose activation has been shown to modulate macrophage and epithelial cell-mediated inflammation. The objective of this study was to use a systems approach for investigating the mechanism by which the deletion of PPAR g in T cells modulates the severity of dextran-sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, immune cell distribution and global gene expression.METHODS: Wild-type (WT) or PPAR g flfl; CD4 Cre+ (CD4cre) mice in a C57BL/6 background were challenged with 2.5% DSS in their drinking water for 0, 2, or 7 days. Mice were scored on disease severity both clinically and histopathologically. Flow cytometry was used to assess lymphocyte and macrophage populations in the blood, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). Global gene expression in colonic mucosa was profiled using Affymetrix microarrays.RESULTS: Both disease severity and inflammation-related body weight loss were accelerated by the deficiency of PPAR g in T cells. Examination of colon histopathology revealed significantly greater epithelial erosion, leukocyte infiltration, and mucosal thickening in the CD4cre mice on day 7. CD4cre mice had more CD8+ T cells than wt mice and fewer CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) and IL10+CD4+ T cells in blood and MLN, respectively. Transcriptomic profiling revealed around 3000 genes being transcriptionally altered as a result of DSS challenge in CD4cre mice. These included up-regulated adhesion molecules on day 7 and proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1b, and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS-3) mRNA expression.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that T cell PPAR g down-regulates inflammation during DSS colitis by inhibiting colonic expression of inflammatory mediators and increasing MLN Treg. Colonic mucosa from wt and CD4cre mice were sampled at 0 (no DSS), 2, and 7 days of DSS-induced experimental colitis.",

Here, we constructed an intracellular-truncated, signaling deficient Mpl protein which is presented on the cell surface (dnMpl). The transplantation of bone marrow cells retrovirally transduced to express dnMpl into wildtype mice induced thrombocytopenia, and a progressive loss of HSC. Functional analysis of the truncated Mpl in vitro and in vivo demonstrated no internalization after Thpo binding and the inhibition of Thpo/Mpl-signaling in wildtype cells due to dominant-negative (dn) effects by receptor competition with wildtype Mpl for Thpo binding. Gene expression analysis was performerd of Lin-Sca1+cKit+ (LSK) cells isolated from mice transplanted with dnMpl transduced BM cells.

Previous evidence indicates that strong overexpression of FBP in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) supports tumor growth and correlates with poor patient prognosis. However, the role of the transcriptional repressor FIR in hepatocarcinogenesis remains poorly delineated. We show that overexpression of FIR correlates with tumor dedifferentiation and tumor cell proliferation in about 60% of primary HCCs. Elevated FIR levels are associated with genomic gains of the fir gene locus at chromosome 8q24.3 in human HCC specimens. In vitro, nuclear enrichment of FIR supports HCC cell proliferation and migration. Expression profiling of HCC cells after siRNA-mediated silencing of FIR identified the transcription factor DP-1 (TFDP1) as a transcriptional target of FIR. Surprisingly, FIR stimulates the expression of FBP in a TFDP1/E2F-dependent manner. FIR splice variants lacking or containing exon 2 and/or exon 5 are expressed in the majority of HCCs. Specific inhibition of FIR isoforms with and without exon 2 revealed that all FIR splice variants facilitate tumor-supporting effects. This finding was confirmed in xenograft transplantation experiments with lentiviral-infected shRNA targeting all FIR variants as well as FIR with and without exon 2. In summary, high-level nuclear FIR does not facilitate repressor properties but supports tumor growth in HCC cells. Thus, the pharmacological inhibition of FIR might represent a promising therapeutic strategy for HCC patients.

    "text": "The Influence of Sleep Deprivation on Hippocampal CA1 Gene Expression: Relation to Stress and Aging. Sleep deprivation (SD) in young adults is associated with metabolic, stress and cognitive responses that are also characteristic of brain aging. Given that sleep architecture changes with age, including increased fragmentation and decreased slow wave activity, it seems reasonable to investigate potential molecular relationships between SD and aging in brain tissue. Here, we tested the hypothesis that young rats exposed to 24 or 72 hour SD would respond with stress and aging-like shifts in brain hippocampal CA1 gene expression. SD animals showed blood corticosterone and weight changes consistent with a stress response. Microarray results, validated by Western blot and comparison to prior SD studies, pointed to disruptions in neurotransmission, sleep pressure signaling, and macromolecular synthesis. In a separate experiment, animals exposed to 24 or 72 hour novel environment stress recapitulated nearly one third of the SD transcriptional profile, particularly upregulated apoptotic and immune signaling pathways. Compared to aging (based on three previously published independent hippocampal aging studies), SD transcriptional profiles agreed for neurogenesis and energy pathways. However, immune signaling, glial activity, macromolecular synthesis and neuronal function all showed an SD profile that was, at least in part, opposed by aging. We conclude that while stress and SD have discrete molecular signatures, they do show a subset of highly similar changes. However, the same could not be said of aging and SD, where a similar subset of genes is changed, but in partially divergent directions. Finally, this work identifies presynaptic vesicular release and intercellular adhesion molecular signatures as novel targets for future SD-countering therapeutics. Subjects: Male Fischer 344 rats (3-5 months old, Harlan, Indianapolis): 37 in cohort 1 and 32 in cohort 2. Subjects were assigned to one of 5 treatment groups: Home Cage-HC n =17; 24 hour sleep deprivation- 24SD n = 16; 72 hour sleep deprivation- 72SD n = 20; 24 hour novel environment stress- 24NES n = 10; 72 hour novel environment stress- 72NES n = 6. Cohorts 1 and 2 were combined for microarray analyses. Sleep Deprivation: The multiple platform modification (Coenen and van Luijtelaar, 1985) of the classic 'flower pot' (Mendelson et al., 1974) technique in which animals are placed on an elevated platform over water was used. Pairs of SD animals (cage mates) were sleep deprived for 24 or 72 hours. Novel Environment Stress (NES): NES animals were exposed to a novel environment, but were not constrained from sleeping. These NES animals paralleled the sleep deprivation exposure duration (24 hour- n = 10, and 72 hour- n = 6). Tissue Isolation: On the day that animals were removed from the SD chambers, they were anesthetized with CO2 gas and decapitated. Brains were removed and immediately placed in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM) 114NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2MgCl2, 30 NaHCO3, 10 Glucose and 2.2CaCl2. Hippocampi were dissected as described previously (Blalock et al., 2003; Kadish et al., 2009). Briefly, dissected hippocampi were immersed in 0 degC oxygenated aCSF and placed on a chilled glass petri dish. The CA1 region was dissected along the long axis of the hippocampus. CA1 tissue was flash frozen and stored at -80deg C until further use. Microarray Protocol: GCOS quality control measures of background signal (74.9 +- 2.1 cohort 1; 59.8 +- 2.3 cohort 2) and RawQ (2.3 +- 0.1 cohort 1; 1.9 +- 0.1 cohort 2), as well as a chip x chip correlation matrix of signal intensity data pointed to a global decrease in background signal intensity in Cohort 2. To control for this, each gene's expression values for HC, 24SD and 72SD was standardized separately within cohort 1 and cohort 2, and then the two cohorts were combined. This retained the variability of each cohort, but removed the 'cohort effect' from the data. Pre-statistical filtering retained 'A' grade probe sets that were uniquely annotated (Affymetrix, June 2011) with gene symbols and had at least 6 presence calls across all 71 chips. This criterion was selected based on factorial analysis demonstrating < 5% probability of 6 or more chips being rated present for a given probe set by chance (Blalock, unpublished observations).",

To investigate the cellular responses induced by air pollution exposures, we performed genome-wide gene expression microarray analysis using whole blood RNA sampled at three time-points across the work weeks of 63 non-smoking employees in the trucking industry. Our objective was to identify the genes and gene networks differentially activated in response to micro-environmental measures of occupational exposure to three pollutants: PM2.5 (particulate matter <= 2.5 microns in diameter) and elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC). Subjects were recruited from 10 trucking terminals in the northeastern US. The participants included workers whose job duties were characterized by different patterns of exposure: pick-up and delivery (P&D) drivers, dock workers, and office workers. Whole blood samples were collected using PaxGene RNA tubes, three times from each subject: (1) before the first shift of the workweek (first day, AM draw); (2) at the end of the first shift (8-12 hours later) on the same day (first day, PM draw); and (3) at the end of the last work shift of the same workweek (last day, PM draw). Micro-environmental samples of PM2.5, and EC and OC in PM1.0 were collected over the full workweek (24 hours/day for 6-9 days) at each of the 10 terminals. The final data set included 165 samples from 63 subjects.",

The goal of this study was to investigate and correlate differential methylation and expression in cells from the target organ in non-infectious granulomatous lung diseases, specifically sarcoidosis and chronic beryllium disease (CBD). To that end, cells were collected from patients via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and extracted nucleic acids were hybridized to genome-wide arrays.We conclude that there are many genes that are both differentially methylated and expressed in the BAL fluid of patients with granulomatous lung disease. We identified 2,726 differentially methylated CpGs mapping to 1,944 unique genes when comparing CBD patients to beryllium-sensitized (BeS) individuals without disease. 69% of these genes were also differentially expressed in CBD. Sarcoidosis patients exhibited directional consistency at many loci, but genome-wide significance was not achieved, likely due to heterogeneity in the patient population.

We treated the following 3 groups of 8-16 week old mice with tamoxifen: 1) CDX2P-CreERT2, Apc flox/+, Kras LSL-G12D/+, Trp53 flox/flox mice (n=6); 2) CDX2P-CreERT2, Apc flox/+, Kras LSL-G12D/+,Trp53 R270H/flox mice (n=6); 3) Wild-type control mice (n=3). The CDX2P-CreERT2 transgene expresses a tamoxifen (TAM)-regulated Cre protein (CreERT2) under control of human CDX2 regulatory sequences, allowing for TAM-inducible targeting of flox alleles in adult mouse terminal ileum, cecum, and colon epithelium. Treating the mice having CDX2P-CreERT2 transgene with tamoxifen permits the Cre recombinase to enter the cell nucleus and recombine the floxed alleles for Apc, Kras, and Trp53, resulting in deletion mutations in Apc and Trp53, and an activating, oncogenic mutation in Kras (G12D mutation). The Trp53 R270H allele carries a constitutive R270H mutation, which is the mouse equivalent of human TP53 R273H mutation. Laser capture microdissection was used to obtain adenocarcinoma tissue samples from the first two groups of mice and normal tissue from control mice. RNA was purified and targets for Affymetrix arrays were synthesized from the mRNAs. We used Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.1 ST plate arrays, which hold 41345 probe-sets, but we largely analyzed just those 24562 probe-sets that were mapped to Entrez gene IDs. Raw data was processed with the Robust Multi-array Average algorithm (RMA). Data is log2-transformed transcript abundance estimates. We fit a one-way ANOVA model to the 3 groups of samples. We supply a supplementary excel workbook that holds the same data as the data matrix file for those 24562 probe-sets, but also holds the probe-set annotation at the time we analyzed the data, and some simple statistical calculations, which selects subsets of the probe-sets as differentially expressed between pairs of groups. It also shows data and analysis from a separate experiment of RNA purified from organoids cultured from samples from 3 groups of mice similar to those here, as well as an extra group of mice with CDX2P-CreERT2 Apc flox/flox genotype.

Asf1B expression was suppressed in response to age in both B6 and BTBR islets, induced by obesity only in B6 islets. This is consistent with other studies reporting a decline in -cell proliferation with age. Asf1b also strongly correlated (R ~ 0.98) with cellular proliferation marker Mki67.

Next to a persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), molecular changes are required for the development of cervical cancer. To identify which molecular alterations drive carcinogenesis, we performed a comprehensive and longitudinal molecular characterization of HPV-transformed keratinocyte cell lines. Comparative genomic hybridization, mRNA, and miRNA expression analysis of four HPV-containing keratinocyte cell lines at eight different time points was performed. Data was analyzed using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, integrated longitudinal expression analysis, and pathway enrichment analysis. Biological relevance of identified key regulatory genes was evaluated in vitro and dual-luciferase assays were used to confirm predicted miRNA-mRNA interactions. We show that the acquisition of anchorage independence of HPV-containing keratinocyte cell lines is particularly associated with copy number alterations. Approximately one third of differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNAs was directly attributable to copy number alterations. Focal adhesion, TGF-beta signaling, and mTOR signaling pathways were enriched among these genes. PITX2 was identified as key regulator of TGF-beta signaling and inhibited cell growth in vitro, most likely by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Predicted miRNA-mRNA interactions miR-221-3p_BRWD3, miR-221-3p_FOS, and miR-138-5p_PLXNB2 were confirmed in vitro.

FXS is due to the absence of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein mainly involved in translational control. Even if this molecular defect is known, no specific therapy is available for FXS. The first alteration observed in the brain of FXS patients and of Fmr1 KO mice, model for FXS, is represented by an abnormal dendritic morphology that is associated with an altered synaptic plasticity. These findings led to numerous studies focused on mature neurons. However, recently, an increasing body of evidence is pointing out the importance of FMRP in the early steps of brain development. Thus, with the purpose to decipher the earliest molecular events leading to FXS we developed a stem-cell-based disease model by knocking-down the expression of Fmr1 in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. To gain insights in the pathways that are affected when FMRP is repressed, we performed a gene expression profile analysis comparing total RNA from shFmr1 and shControl ES cells using whole genome mouse microarrays. Transcripts were clustered according to their Gene Ontology classification using the DAVID software. Surprisingly, the most altered functional category was Nervous system development and function, highlighting the role of FMRP also during the earliest steps of neural development. To study the precise role of FMRP in Embryonic stem (ES) cells, we used an RNAi-based loss-of-function strategy by transducing mouse ES cells with a lentivirus expressing GFP and a shRNA targeting the constitutive exon 1 of Fmr1 (shFmr1). A random shRNA (shCT) was used as a control sequence. Transduced cells were sorted by flow cytometry and established as non-clonal cell populations.

To identify the molecular mechanisms that may initiate therapeutic effects, whole-genome expression profiling (Illumina Mouse WG-6 microarrays) of drug-induced alterations in the mouse brain was undertaken, with a focus on the time-course (1, 2, 4 and 8h) of gene expression changes produced by eighteen major psychotropic drugs: antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, psychostimulants and opioids. The resulting database is freely accessible at www.genes2mind.org. Bioinformatics approaches led to the identification of three main drug-responsive genomic networks and indicated neurobiological pathways that mediate the alterations in transcription. Each tested psychotropic drug was characterized by a unique gene network expression profile related to its neuropharmacological properties. Functional links that connect expression of the networks to the development of neuronal adaptations (MAPK signaling pathway), control of brain metabolism (adipocytokine pathway), and organization of cell projections (mTOR pathway) were found. The additional data-sets are available at GEOX1 and GEOX2. The microarray experiment was performed to analyze time-course of drug-induced transcriptional response in C57BL/6J mouse striatum. Three antidepressants (imipramine 10 mg/kg, fluoxetine 20 mg/kg and tianeptine 20 mg/kg, i.p.) were selected for the comparison.

But shortly after the reinvigoration those T cells went back to dysfunctional state. TCR-transgenic TEa CD4+ T cells (B6 background) recognize a Balb/c I-Ea allopeptide presented by B6 antigen presenting cells, and were used to assess the effects of immune checkpoint blockades on Irf4-deficient alloreactive T cells.

Breast cancer cells display preferences for specific metastatic sites including the bone, lung and liver. Metastasis is a complex process that relies, in part, on interactions between disseminated cancer cells and resident/infiltrating stromal cells that constitute the metastatic microenvironment. Distinct immune infiltrates can either impair the metastatic process or conversely, assist in the seeding, colonization and growth of disseminated cancer cells. Using in vivo selection approaches, we previously isolated 4T1-derived breast cancer cells that preferentially metastasize to these organs and tissues. In this study, we examined whether the propensity of breast cancer cells to metastasize to the lung, liver or bone is associated with and dependent on distinct patterns of immune cell infiltration. Immunohistocytochemistry and immunohistofluorescence approaches were used to quantify granulocytic infiltrates within distinct metastases and depletion of Gr1+ cells was performed to functionally interrogate the role of myeloid/granulocytic infiltrates in promoting metastasis to these organs.We show that T lymphocytes (CD3+), myeloid-derived/granulocytic cells (Gr-1+) cells and neutrophils (NE+) exhibit the most pronounced recruitment in lung and liver metastases, with markedly less recruitment within bone metastatic lesions. Interestingly, these infiltrating cell populations display different patterns of localization within soft tissue metastases. T lymphocytes and neutrophils are localized around the periphery of liver metastases whereas they were dispersed throughout the lung metastases. Furthermore, Gr-1+ cell-depletion studies demonstrate that infiltrating myeloid-derived/granulocytic cells, including neutrophils, are essential for the formation of breast cancer liver metastases but dispensable for metastasis to the lung and bone. Finally, we demonstrate that neutrophils that infiltrate and surround the liver metastases are polarized towards an N2 phenotype, which have previously been shown to enhance tumor growth and metastasis. Our results demonstrate that the liver metastatic potential of breast cancer cells is heavily reliant on interactions with infiltrating myeloid/granulocytic cells in the liver microenvironment.

    "text": "RNAseq analysis of alternative splicing in PTBP2 knockout mouse brain. The splicing regulator PTBP2 controls a program of embryonic splicing required for neuronal maturation. The splicing regulatory proteins PTBP1 and PTBP2 show distinct temporal expression profiles in the developing brain. Neuronal progenitor cells predominantly express PTBP1, whereas developing neurons express high levels of PTBP2, which are subsequently reduced late in neuronal maturation. We show here that PTBP2 and the program of splicing it controls are essential to proper neuronal maturation and survival. To investigate its in vivo function, we generated conditional PTBP2 null alleles in mice. Loss of PTBP2 in neuronal progenitor cells leads to neonatal death without gross defects in brain architecture. Mice with specific depletion of PTBP2 in the cortex and forebrain are viable. However over the first three postnatal weeks, when the normal cortex expands and develops mature circuits, the PTBP2 null cortices degenerate. We find that PTBP2-/- neurons cultured from embryonic brain show the same initial viability as wild type cells with proper early marker expression and neurite outgrowth. Strikingly, between 10 and 20 days in culture PTBP2 null neurons undergo a catastrophic failure to mature and die. To assess the target transcripts leading to these phenotypes, we examined the genomewide splicing changes in the PTBP2 null brains. This identified a large number of mis-regulated exons that share a temporal pattern of regulation; in the absence of PTBP2 many isoforms normally found in adults are precociously expressed in the developing brain. Transcripts following this pattern encode essential neuronal proteins affecting neurite growth, pre- and post-synaptic assembly, and synaptic transmission. Our results define a new genetic regulatory program essential for neuronal survival and maturation, where PTBP2 acts to temporarily repress expression of protein isoforms until the final maturation of the neuron. Mice carrying a conditional \"floxed\" PTBP2 allele of PTBP2 were crossed to mice carrying Cre recombinase driven by either the nestin or Emx1 promoters. The resulting knockout mutant mouse brains were analyzed for changes in gene expression and alternative splicing. Knockout mice were compared to wildtype littermates. Whole mouse brain polyA plus RNA was isolated from two Nestin-cre knockout embryos at embryonic day 18 and compared to two wildtype littermates. Total polyA plus RNA was isolated from the cortices of an Emx-cre knockout and its wildtype littermate at postnatal day 1. This RNA was converted to standard Illumina paired end libraries using the Truseq kit. The Emx sample and control libraries were strand specific through elimination of the second strand of cDNA using the USER enzyme. Libaries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq using the standard paired end protocol. Data was analyzed using the Cufflinks pipeline. Splicing analysis was carried out using the SpliceTrap program.",

In vivo reprogramming in conjunction with EMF stimulation efficiently alleviated symptoms in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD) in a noninvasive and controllable manner.

To study differentially expressed genes in neuro-ectodermal cell linesMYCN amplification (NMA) is the most important prognostic factor in neuroblastoma (NBL) patients, however 70% of advanced stage NBL are non-NMA and lack known driving oncogenic events. Gene expression profiles (HU133plus2.0 arrays, Affymetrix) of 17 NBL and 5 peripheral neuro-ectodermal cell lines were used to identify potential subgroups of NBL cell lines with a distinct gene signature. One group of non-NMA NBL cell lines was identified with a distinct gene expression profile and characterized by high expression of AXL. AXL is a tyrosine kinase receptor which plays a role in the metastatic process of cancer. We hypothesized that AXL contributes to the metastasizing potential of non-NMA NBL and tested if AXL silencing diminishes malignant properties of high AXL expressing cell lines. AXL was silenced in two non-NMA NBL cell lines by using a lentiviral shRNA construct that was able to transduce these cell lines with >90% infection efficiency. AXL mRNA expression level was efficiently knocked-down resulting in a severe decrease of migration of AXL positive cell lines GI-M-EN and SH-EP-2, and decreased invasion of GI-M-EN. Morphologically, AXL knockdown induced more rounded cells with a loss of contact. Intracellularly, we observed induction of stress fibers (immunofluorescence F-actin) in GI-M-EN. These changes in cytoskelet were associated with decreased migration. No effects were observed for cell proliferation, apoptosis or downstream pathways. In conclusion, AXL is identified as a possible mediator of NBL metastasis. Arrays were performed with 5 different PNET cell lines, which were used as controls for 17 NBL cell lines (GSE22771).",

Transactivation of the dopamine receptor 3 gene by a single provirus integration results in development of B-cell lymphoma in transgenic mice generated from retrovirally transduced embryonic stem cells.Gene transfer vectors based on retroviruses are commonly used in gene therapy applications because of their unique ability to integrate efficiently into host genomes. This ability also forms the basis of a transformation event that can be induced in transduced cells by transactivation of proto-oncogenes near the vector integration sites. Here, we report on the development of lymphoma in mice generated from embryonic stem cells transduced with an enhanced green fluorescent protein. The cells expressed B220, CD5, Mac1, and IgM on their surfaces and expressed transcription factors characteristic of B cell lymphoma. Importantly, each mouse had a single copy of the provirus in its genome; the copy was integrated into the second intron of the dopamine receptor 3 (D3) gene, and high-level expression of D3 was detected only in the lymphoma cells. Ectopic expression of D3 in murine marrow cells resulted in preferential proliferation of cells at the pre-B-cell stage in response to a D3-specific agonist, but this proliferation was not observed in vivo. Cells co-transduced with D3 and Bcl-xL genes had a phenotype similar to that of lymphoma in vivo, suggesting that the leukemogenesis induced by retroviral integration required \"second hit\" mutations of additional genes.

The study objectives were: 1) to detect transcript changes in blood due to life-threatening hyperthermia produced by elevated environmental temperatures (39degC, produces no or minimal neurotoxicity); 2) detect transcripts that could serve as biomarkers specific for neurotoxic amphetamine exposures and not seen with environmentally-induced hyperthermia; and 3) determine the transcript changes related to the immune system in circulating blood produced by either non-neurotoxic or neurotoxic amphetamine exposures.Amphetamine effects on gene expression are dependent on body temperature and indicate that many significant changes in genes related to the immune system occur, some likely in response to damage, even when animals remain normothermic during amphetamine exposure. Also, hyperthermia alone produces many changes in immune related genes in blood. Five groups of animals were necessary to meet the study objectives.

We hypothesized that the combination of NP exposure and virus infection leads to a different outcome than each factor alone. To test this hypothesis, we applied different carbonaceous NP in the model system of murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68), which serves as a small animal model for gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis in vitro and in vivo. NP exposure of latently infected cells induced lytic virus production, while virus growth after de novo infection was not affected.To investigate the effect of pulmonary NP exposure in vivo, latently infected mice were instilled with carbonaceous NP or left untreated. After 24 hours, lung tissue was harvested for analysis. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated an increase in lytic viral proteins after exposure to NP. Simultaneously, gene expression analysis revealed a signature with considerable parallels to the one seen during acute infection. Analysis of the metabolome demonstrated an enrichment of phospholipids in latently infected mice after short-time exposure to NP, matching profoundly with the pattern observed during acute virus infection. Furthermore, the effect of NP exposure on virus reactivation could also be observed in human cells latently infected with Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV). Our results indicate that the combination of NP exposure and persistent herpesvirus infection restores a molecular signature found in acute virus infection, boosts production of lytic viral proteins, and induces an inflammatory response in the lung - a pattern which might finally result in tissue damage and fibrotic alterations.

The goal of the current study was to analyze guadecitabine-induced DNA methylation and gene expression changes and correlate pretreatment levels with clinical outcomes. Epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HM450) and RNA sequencing revealed extensive methylation and gene expression changes induced by guadecitabine in ovarian tumors. Ninety-four gene promoters were significantly hypomethylated after treatment with guadecitabine and 949 genes were differentially expressed in pre vs. post-treatment tumors.

Neural crest-derived neural stem cells (NCSCs) from the embryonic PNS can be reprogrammed in neurosphere culture (NS) to rNCSCs that produce CNS progeny, including myelinating oligodendrocytes. Using global gene expression analysis we now demonstrate that rNCSCs completely lose their previous PNS characteristics and acquire the identity of neural stem cells derived from embryonic spinal cord (SCSCs). Reprogramming proceeds rapidly and results in a homogenous population of Olig2-, Sox3- and Lex-positive CNS stem cells. Low-level expression of pluripotency inducing genes Oct4, Nanog and Klf4 argues against a transient pluripotent state during reprogramming. The acquisition of CNS properties is prevented in the presence of BMP4 (BMP NCSCs) as shown by marker gene expression and the potential to produce PNS neurons and glia. In addition, genes characteristic for mesenchymal and perivascular progenitors are expressed, which suggests that BMP NCSCs are directed towards a pericyte progenitor/mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) fate. Adult NCSCs from mouse palate, an easily accessible source of adult NCSCs, display strikingly similar properties. They do not generate cells with CNS characteristics but lose the neural crest markers Sox10 and p75 and produce MSCs. These findings show that embryonic NCSCs acquire a full CNS identity in neurosphere culture. In contrast, MSCs are generated from adult pNCSCs and BMP NCSCs, which reveals that postmigratory NCSCs are a source for MSCs up to the adult stage.

These defects are cell autonomous. The goal of this study is to compare transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) data obtained from HSC and multipotent progenitors (MPP) isolated from 5A3+/del mice and their wildtype littermates, in order to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways that may contribute to the phenotype.Methods: Total RNA was isolated from CD150hi-HSC, CD150lo-HSC and CD150neg-MPP from wildtype and 5A3+/del mice. 10ng of total RNA was converted into double-stranded cDNA using the Ovation RNA Amplification System V2 (NuGen, CA), and the amplified cDNA products were then used to generate RNA-seq libraries using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 reagents (Illumina, CA) with 10 PCR amplification cycles. Library quality and quantity were assessed by the Agilent DNA1000 Chip (Agilent, CA) and qPCR (Kappa Biosystems Inc, MA). 10 pM of each library was sequenced using Illumina SBS chemistry at 2 x 100 bp reads on the HiSeq2000 (Illumina(r), CA). The RNA-Seq paired-end reads were mapped to the mouse mm9 genome using an in-house mapping and quality assessment pipeline. The expression of each gene was estimated by the mean coverage of the highest-covered coding exon. Genes with low expression level (<10) across all samples were filtered out, followed by quantile normalization. Differential expression analysis was performed using limma with estimation of false-discovery rate. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was used to assess pathway enrichment.Results:Transcriptome (RNA-Seq) and Taqman quantitative real-time PCR analyses revealed a ~50% reduction in the expression of multiple genes and of the long intergenic non-coding RNA 503142E22Rik within the 5A3 interval in mutant HSC and MPP. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of the RNA-Seq data from 5A3+/del HSCs further demonstrated reduced expression of multiple gene sets related to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) that are similarly down-regulated in the early stages of human therapy-induced MDS and AML.Conclusions: Our study revealed that genes involved in OXPHOS were down-regulated in 5A3+/del HSC, and this finding provided novel insights into the impact of chromosome 7 deletions on the pathogenesis of MDS. Transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) data of HSC and MPP isolated from 5A3+/del mice and their wildtype littermates were generated by sequencing, in quintuplicate, using Illumina SBS chemistry at 2 x 100 bp reads on the HiSeq2000 (Illumina(r), CA).",

    "text": "Effect of MWCNT on Lung Fibroblast gene expression. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) cause lung fibrosis in rodents and exacerbate airway fibrosis in the mouse ovalbumin model of allergic asthma. Interleukin 13 (IL-13) is a key cytokine secreted by T helper type 2 (Th2) cells. IL-13 is up-regulated in human asthma and animal models that activate pro-fibrotic and pro-proliferative cell signaling cascades in human lung fibroblasts (HLF). This study tested the hypothesis that IL-13 alters the gene expression profile of HLF exposed to MWCNT. Carbon black nanoparticles (CBNP) were also compared to MWCNT as they are relatively inert nanoparticles that do not cause fibrosis. Confluent, quiescent cultures of HLF were treated with 10 ng/ml IL-13 or serum-free defined medium (vehicle) for 24 hours prior to treatment with 10 ug/cm2 MWCNT or CBNP. At 4, 24, or 48 hours following nanoparticle exposure, total RNA was isolated and gene expression was measured using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133A2.0 Array. The data were analyzed using the JMP Genomics statistical platform. IL-13 and MWCNT each caused changes in the expression of distinct gene subsets over the time-course investigated. The combination of IL-13 and MWCNT resulted in a gene expression profile that was distinct from patterns induced or suppressed by either IL-13 or MWCNT alone. CBNP caused changes in gene expression that were distinct from IL-13 or MWCNT. Interestingly, the combination of IL-13 and MWCNT increased the expression of IL-17A and increased collagen (Col1A1), while MWCNT alone increased interferon-inducible protein-27 (IFI27), suggesting that Th2 microenvironment containing IL-13 shifts MWCNT-induced gene expression from a Th1 to a Th17 gene expression profile. These data provide insight into the mechanisms by which MWCNT alter the biology of fibroblasts during normal and allergic inflammatory conditions. Adult Lung Fibroblasts were treated with 10 ug/cm2 MWCNT, CBNP, or vehicle with or without IL-13 for 4 hours, 24 hours, or 48 hours.",

Phenotypic and metabolic heterogeneity within tumors is a major barrier to effective cancer therapy. Yet how metabolism is implicated in specific phenotypes, and whether lineage-restricted mechanisms control key metabolic vulnerabilities remains poorly understood. In melanoma, down-regulation of the lineage addiction oncogene Microphthalmia-associated Transcription Factor (MITF) is a hallmark of the proliferative-to-invasive phenotype switch, though how MITF promotes proliferation and suppresses invasion is poorly defined. Here we show that MITF is a lineage restricted activator of the key lipogenic enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), and that SCD is required for MITFHigh melanoma cell proliferation. By contrast MITFLow cells are insensitive to SCD inhibition. Significantly, the MITF-SCD axis suppresses metastasis, inflammatory signalling, and an ATF4-mediated feedback-loop that maintains dedifferentiation. Our results reveal that MITF is a lineagespecific regulator of metabolic reprogramming, whereby fatty acid composition is a driver of melanoma phenotype-switching, and highlight that cell phenotype dictates response to drugs targeting lipid metabolism. 501mel and IGR37 melanoma cell lines were treated with the indicated siRNA or SCD inhibitors for 48h prior to RNA extraction and sequencing.",

    "text": "Glycyrrhetinic acid antagonizes pressure-induced venous remodeling in mice. Development of spider veins is caused by the remodeling of veins located in the upper dermis and promoted by risk factors such as obesity or pregnancy that chronically increase venous pressure. We have repeatedly shown that the pressure-induced increase in biomechanical wall stress is sufficient to evoke the formation of enlarged corkscrew-like superficial veins in mice. Subsequent experimental approaches revealed that interference with endothelial- and/or smooth muscle cell activation counteracts this remodeling process. Here, we investigate whether the herbal agent glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is a suitable candidate for that purpose given its anti-proliferative as well as anti-oxidative properties.While basic abilities of cultured venous smooth muscle cells (SMCs) such as migration and proliferation were not influenced by GA, it inhibited proliferation but not angiogenic sprouting of human venous endothelial cells (ECs). Further analyses of biomechanically stimulated ECs revealed that GA inhibits the DNA binding capacity of the mechanosensitive transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1) which, however, had only a minor impact on the endothelial transcriptome. Nevertheless, by decreasing gelatinase activity in ECs or mouse veins exposed to biomechanical stress, GA diminished a crucial cellular response in the context of venous remodeling. In line with the observed inhibitory effects, local transdermal application of GA attenuated pressure-mediated enlargement of veins in the mouse auricle. In summary, our data identifies GA as an inhibitor of EC proliferation, gelatinase activity and venous remodeling. It may thus have the capacity to attenuate spider vein formation and remodeling in humans. Comparison of biomechanically stretched HUVEC treated with DMSO or Glycyrrhetinic acid.",

Cardiac hypertrophy is associated with growth and functional changes of cardiomyocytes,including mitochondrial alterations, but the latter are still poorly understood. Here we investigated mitochondrial function and dynamic localization in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVCs) stimulated with insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF1) or phenylephrine (PE), mimicking physiological and pathological hypertrophic responses,respectively.A decreased activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) (state 3) was observed in permeabilized NRVCs stimulated with PE, whereas this was improved in IGF1 stimulated NRVCs. In contrast, in intact NRVCs, mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate(OCR) was increased in PE stimulated NRVCs, but remained constant in IGF1 stimulated NRVCs. After stimulation with PE, mitochondria localized to the periphery of the cell. To study the differences in more detail, we performed gene array studies. IGF1 and PE stimulated NRVCs did not reveal major differences in gene expression of mitochondrial encoding proteins, but we identified a gene encoding amotor protein implicated in mitochondrial localization, kinesin family member 5b (Kif5b ), which was clearly elevated in PE stimulated NRVCs but not in IGF1 stimulated NRVCs. We confirmed that Kif5b gene and protein expression was elevated in animal models with pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Silencing of Kif5b reverted the peripheral mitochondrial localization in PE stimulated NRVCs and diminished PE induced increases in mitochondrial OCR, indicating that KIF5B dependent localization affects cellular responses to PE stimulated NRVCs. These results indicate that KIF5B contributes to mitochondrial localization and function in cardiomyocytes and may play a role in pathological hypertrophic responses in vivo. NRVCs were isolated from 12 neonatal (Sprague Dawley) rats of 1-3 days old. 4 control, 4 PE, and 4 IGF1 stimulated NRVCs were used and arrayed.",

The prevalence of immune-mediated diseases such as allergies and autoimmune diseases is on the rise in the developed world. Microbial exposure is known to modulate the risk for these diseases. In order to explore differences in the gene expression patterns induced in utero in infants born in contrasting standards of living and hygiene, we collected umbilical cord blood RNA samples from full-term newborn infants born with normal vaginal delivery in Finland (modern society), Estonia (rapidly developing society) and the Republic of Karelia, Russia (poor economical conditions). Transcriptomic profiles were analyzed using whole genome microarrays including gender, gestational age, birth month and HLA allele genotype as confounding variables in the analysis. The data revealed that the whole blood transcriptome of Finnish and Estonian neonates differ from their Karelian counterparts. Samples from Karelian infants had an increase in transcripts associated with LPS induction and bacterial sepsis observed in 1-year-old infants in earlier studies. The results suggest exposure to toll like receptor (TLR) ligands and a more matured immune response in infants born in Petrozavodsk compared to the Finnish and Estonian infants. These results further support the concept of a conspicuous plasticity in the developing immune system: the environmental factors that play a role in the susceptibility/protection towards immune-mediated diseases begin to shape the neonatal immunity already in utero and direct the maturation of both the adaptive and the innate immune responses in accordance with the surrounding microbial milieu.

Accumulating evidence suggests that dysregulation of hypoxia-regulated transcriptional mechanisms is involved in development of chronic kidney diseases (CKD). However, it remains unclear how hypoxia-induced transcription factors (HIFs) and subsequent biological processes contribute to CKD development and progression. In our study, genome-wide expression profiles of more than 200 renal biopsies from patients with different CKD stages revealed significant correlation of HIF-target genes with eGFR in glomeruli and tubulointerstitium. These correlations were positive and negative and in part compartment-specific. Microarrays of proximal tubular cells and podocytes with stable HIF1a and/or HIF2a suppression displayed cell type-specific HIF1/HIF2-dependencies as well as dysregulation of several pathways. WGCNA analysis identified gene sets that were highly coregulated within modules. Characterization of the modules revealed common as well as cell group- and condition-specific pathways, GO-Terms and transcription factors. Gene expression analysis of the hypoxia-interconnected pathways in patients with different CKD stages revealed an increased dysregulation with loss of renal function. In conclusion, our data clearly point to a compartment- and cell type-specific dysregulation of hypoxia-associated gene transcripts and might help to improve the understanding of hypoxia, HIF dysregulation, and transcriptional program response in CKD.

The developmental transition to motherhood requires gene expression changes that alter the brain to prepare and drive the female to perform maternal behaviors. Furthermore, it is expected that the many physiological changes accompanying pregnancy and postpartum stages will impact brain gene expression patterns. To understand how extensive these gene expression changes are, we examined the global transcriptional response broadly, by examining four different brain regions: hypothalamus, hippocampus, neocortex, and cerebellum. Further, to understand the time course of these changes we performed RNA-sequencing analyses on mRNA derived from virgin females, two pregnancy time points and three postpartum time points. We find that each brain region and time point shows a unique molecular signature, with only 49 genes differentially expressed in all four regions, across the time points. Additionally, several genes previously implicated in underlying postpartum depression change expression. This study serves as a comprehensive atlas of gene expression changes in the maternal brain in the cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and neocortex. At each of the time points analyzed, all four brain regions show extensive changes, suggesting that pregnancy, parturition, and postpartum maternal experience substantially impacts diverse brain regions. Libraries were prepared from three independent biological replicates, mRNA for each biological replicate was derived from a single mouse brain, with each mouse brain being used to collect all four brain regions.",

Neuronal cultures were treated with candesartan at neuroprotective concentrations followed by excitotoxic glutamate amounts. Candesartan significantly reduced glutamate-induced inflammation. To provide mechanistic insight into the potential targets and pathways that may underlie these benefits, we performed genome wide expression profile analysis and evaluated the data by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). We found that the inflammation signal transduction pathways were major components of the neuronal response to glutamate excitotoxicity, and that candesartan significantly ameliorated glutamate-induced alterations in gene expression. Further analysis showed significant associations of these genes with two independent published networks identified by microarray analysis of hippocampal samples obtained post-mortem from brains of patients diagnosed with AD . 8 days old rat Primary cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) were treated with DMSO, Glutamate, Candesartan or Glutamate +candesartan.

Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTL) is an aggressive lymphoma cytogenetically characterized by isochromosome 7q [i(7)(q10)], of which the molecular consequences remain unknown. We report here results of an integrative genomic and transcriptomic (expression microarray and RNA-sequencing) study of six HSTL cases with i(7)(q10) and three cases with ring 7 [r(7)], a rare variant aberration. Using high resolution array CGH, we prove that HSTL is characterized by the common loss of a 34.88 Mb region at 7p22.1p14.1 (3506316-38406226 bp) and duplication/amplification of a 38.77 Mb region at 7q22.11q31.1 (86259620-124892276 bp). Our data indicate that i(7)(q10)/r(7)-associated loss of 7p22.1p14.1 is a critical event in the development of HSTL, while gain of 7q sequences drives progression of the disease and underlies its intrinsic chemoresistance. Loss of 7p22.1p14.1 does not target a postulated tumor suppressor gene but unexpectedly enhances the expression of CHN2 from the remaining 7p allele, resulting in dysregulation of a pathway involving RAC1 and NFATC2 with a cell proliferation response. Gain of 7q leads to increased expression of critical genes, including RUNDC3B, PPP1R9A and ABCB1, a known multidrug resistance gene. RNA-sequencing did not identify any additional recurrent mutations or fusion, suggesting that i(7)(q10) is the only driver event in this tumor. Our study confirms the previously described gene expression profile of HSTL and identifies a set of 24 genes, including three located on chromosome 7 (CHN2, ABCB1 and PPP1R9A), distinguishing HSTL from other malignancies. The fastq files of all samples were mapped to the reference human genome (assembly GRCh37.68). The mapping was performed allowing detection of insertions and deletions (indels). The mapped reads were used to calculate read counts and FPKM (Fragment Per Kilobase of exon model per Million of mapped read) per gene.

Purpose: The aim of this study is to identify known and novel small RNAs (Piwi-interacting RNAs and microRNAs) in normal ovary and epithelial ovarian malignancies by adopting high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and unveil their possible functions in neoplastic pathways of the two most frequently observed and highly lethal subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancers, endometrioid ovarian cancer (ENOCa) and serous ovarian cancer (SOCa). The study has been performed in normal ovarian tissues as well as malignant tissues of these cancer subtypes.Methods: 1 ug of total RNA was used as the starting material for library preparation as prescribed by Illumina Truseq small RNA library protocol. Small RNA sequencing was carried out by Genotypic Technology, Bangalore, India on Illumina Next-Seq 500 platform. Library preparation was done by performing 3' and 5' adapter ligation followed by reverse transcription of cDNA and amplification of the library. The construct of the library was fractionated to select 16-40 nucleotide insert of small RNAs using PAGE. The quality check of the library was done in Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer using a DNA-specific chip, such as High Sensitivity DNA. The sequence reads that passed through Quality Check by FastQC and aligned to the human genome (hg19) were further analysed using in-house pipelines and set of known and novel piRNAs and miRNAs were identified. The sets of known piRNAs and miRNAs identified were assessed for their involvement in neoplastic processes of ovarian cancer subtypes by performing target analysis and GO enrichment studies.Results: Using an in-house prediction pipeline, we mapped about 10-15 million sequence reads per sample to the human genome (hg19) and detected 256, 234 and 219 annotated piRNAs in ENOCa, SOCa, and normal ovary respectively; whereas the average number of known miRNAs present in each sample was estimated to be 480. The annotated piRNAs obtained from each sample exhibited varied length distribution between 26-32 nts.Conclusions: For the first time, our study reported the presence of piRNAs in ENOCa, SOCa and normal ovarian tissue from the next-gen sequencing of small RNAs of 16-40 nts length. The extensive catalogue of human EOCa small RNAs (both piRNAs and miRNAs) detected in this study provides a useful resource to dissect complex neoplastic events that are possibly mediated by these ncRNAs, especially by piRNAs. Moreover, these piRNAs could be used as probable small RNA biomarkers for the EOCa. Small RNA profile of human epithelial ovarian cancer and normal epithelial ovarian tissue was generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Next-Seq 500.",

Similarly, Zika virus (ZIKV) was also highly sensitive to IFN-k-mediated suppression. With an IAV infected mouse model, we found that IFN-k was the earliest responding type I interferon among all known members in mice after H9N2 infection, a low-pathogenic Avian Influenza, whereas this early induction did not occur upon highly pathogenic H7N9 infection. IFN-k can efficiently contain both low- and high-pathogenic influenza replication in cultured human lung cells, and CHD6 was the major effector responsive molecule for IFN-k, but not for IFN-a/b. Furthermore, we discovered that both IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 subunits of type I interferon receptor and their downstream axis of p38-cFos are engaged in IFN-k signaling cascade to acti vate CHD6, which didn't require STAT1 activity. In addition, we showed that the pre-treatment with IFN-k before IAV challenge protected mice from high mortality. Altogether, our study identified an IFN-k-specific pathway that suppressed influenza A virus in vitro and in vivo. Thus, IFN-k may have potential as a new prevention and treatment agents against emerging viruses.

Dicer is a deeply conserved endoribonuclease with key functions in small RNA biogenesis. Here we employed PAR-CLIP/iPAR-CLIP to identify direct Dicer binding sites in the transcriptomes of human cells and human. We found hundreds of novel miRNAs and non-canonical Dicer substrates with high sensitivity. Small RNA production depended on structure of the binding site and is globally biased towards the 5' arm of hairpins. Unexpectedly, in both species Dicer bound numerous hairpins inside mRNAs without observable small RNA production. Our data revealed ~100 mRNAs of protein coding genes to be targeted in both human and worm. These mRNAs significantly overlapped with the RNAi pathway. We also, unexpectedly, found that mitochondrial transcripts are Dicer targets in both species. We demonstrate functional consequences of Dicer binding by perturbation analysis. Taken together,we provide the first genome-wide catalog of direct Dicer targets. Our results suggest widespread function outside of miRNA biogenesis.

The PAF complex (Paf1C) has been shown to regulate chromatin modifications, gene transcription, and PolII elongation. Here, we provide the first genome-wide analysis of chromatin occupancy by the entire PAF complex in mammalian cells. We show that Paf1C is recruited not only to promoters and gene bodies, but also to regions downstream of cleavage/polyadenylation (pA) sites at 3' ends, a profile that sharply contrasted with the yeast complex. Remarkably, our studies identified novel, subunit-specific links between Paf1C and regulation of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) and upstream antisense transcription. Moreover, we found that depletion of Paf1C subunits also resulted in the accumulation of RNA polymerase II (PolII) over gene bodies, which coincided with APA. Depletion of specific Paf1C subunits leads to global loss of histone H2B ubiquitylation, but surprisingly, there is little impact of Paf1C depletion on other histone modifications, including the tri-methylation of histone H3 on lysines 4 and 36 (H3K4me3 and H3K36me3), previously associated with this complex. Our results provide surprising differences with yeast, while unifying observations that link Paf1C with PolII elongation and RNA processing, and suggest that Paf1C could play a role in protecting transcripts from premature cleavage by preventing PolII accumulation at TSS-proximal pA sites.

Proteinuria is the most important predictor of outcome in glomerulonephritis and experimental data suggest that the tubular cell response to proteinuria is an important determinant of progressive fibrosis in the kidney. However, it is unclear whether proteinuria is a marker of disease severity or has a direct effect on tubular cells in the kidneys of patients with glomerulonephritis. Accordingly we studied an in vitro model of proteinuria, and identified 231 albumin-regulated genes differentially expressed by primary human kidney tubular epithelial cells exposed to albumin. We translated these findings to human disease by studying mRNA levels of these genes in the tubulo-interstitial compartment of kidney biopsies from patients with IgA nephropathy using microarrays. Biopsies from patients with IgAN (n=25) could be distinguished from those of control subjects (n=6) based solely upon the expression of these 231 albumin-regulated genes. The expression of an 11-transcript subset related to the degree of proteinuria, and this 11-mRNA subset was also sufficient to distinguish biopsies of subjects with IgAN from control biopsies. We tested if these findings could be extrapolated to other proteinuric diseases beyond IgAN and found that the all forms of primary glomerulonephritis (n=33) can be distinguished from controls (n=21) based solely on the expression levels of these 11 genes derived from our in vitro proteinuria model. Pathway analysis suggests common regulatory elements shared by these 11 transcripts. In conclusion, we have identified an albumin-regulated 11-gene signature shared between all forms of primary glomerulonephritis.

UCP3 is expressed at low levels in skin and our lab has demonstrated that overexpression of UCP3 in epidermis (K5-UCP3 mice) provides marked resistance to two-stage chemical carcinogenesis protocols in skin. To further understand the mechanisms by which UCP3 promotes this cancer resistant phenotype, we performed a microarray analysis of dorsal skin biopsies from wild type FVB/N and K5-UCP3 mice. The results of this array indicate that UCP3 overexpression in skin enhances keratinocytes differentiation and fatty acid oxidation in skin, and taken together with other data we have provided a mechanistic link between fatty acid oxidation and Akt inhibition in UCP3-mediated cancer resistance.

Importantly, metabolic intermediates including mitochondrial metabolites are central substrates for post-translational modifications at the core of cellular signalling and epigenetics. However, the molecular means that coordinate the use of mitochondrial metabolites for anabolism and nuclear protein modification are poorly understood. Here, we unexpectedly found that genetic and pharmacological inactivation of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase A1 (PDHA1), a subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) that regulates mitochondrial metabolism16 inhibits prostate cancer development in different mouse and human xenograft tumour models. Intriguingly, we found that lipid biosynthesis was strongly affected in prostate tumours upon PDC inactivation.

In line with the oncogenic function of PDC in prostate cancer, we find that PDHA1 and the PDC activator, Pyruvate dehydrogenase phospatase 1 (PDP1), are frequently amplified and overexpressed at both gene and protein level in these tumours.

The functions of key oncogenic transcription factors independent of context have not been fully delineated despite our richer understanding of the genetic alterations in human cancers. The MYC oncogene, which produces the Myc transcription factor, is frequently altered in human cancer and is a major regulatory hub for many cancers. In this regard, we sought to unravel the primordial signature of Myc function by using high-throughput genomic approaches to identify the cell-type independent core Myc target gene signature. Using a model of human B lymphoma cells bearing inducible MYC, we identified a stringent set of direct Myc target genes via chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), global nuclear run-on assay, and changes in mRNA levels. We also identified direct Myc targets in human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We further document that a Myc core signature (MCS) set of target genes is shared in mouse and human ESCs as well as in four other human cancer cell types. Remarkably, the expression of the MCS correlates with MYC expression in a cell-type independent manner across 8,129 microarray samples, which include 312 cell and tissue types. Furthermore, the expression of the MCS is elevated in vivo in Em-Myc transgenic murine lymphoma cells as compared with premalignant or normal B lymphocytes.

    "text": "The Stability of the Transcriptome during the Estrous Cycle in Four Regions of the Mouse Brain. We analyzed the transcriptome of the C57BL/6J mouse hypothalamus, hippocampus, neocortex, and cerebellum to determine estrous cycle-specific changes in these four brain regions. We found almost 16,000 genes are present in one or more of the brain areas but only 210 genes, ~1.3%, are significantly changed as a result of the estrous cycle. The hippocampus has the largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (82), followed by the neocortex (76), hypothalamus (63), and cerebellum (26). Most of these DEGs (186/210) are differentially expressed in only one of the four brain regions. A key finding is the unique expression pattern of growth hormone (Gh) and prolactin (Prl). Gh and Prl are the only DEGs to be expressed during only one stage of the estrous cycle (metestrus). To gain insight into the function of the DEGs, we examined gene ontology and phenotype enrichment and found significant enrichment for genes associated with myelination, hormone stimulus, and abnormal hormone levels. Additionally, 61 of the 210 DEGs are known to change in response to estrogen in the brain. 50 genes differentially expressed as a result of the estrous cycle are related to myelin and oligodendrocytes and 12 of the 63 DEGs in the hypothalamus are oligodendrocyte- and myelin-specific genes. This transcriptomic analysis reveals that gene expression in the female mouse brain is remarkably stable during the estrous cycle and demonstrates that the genes that do fluctuate are functionally related. Hypothalamus, hippocampus, neocortex, and cerebellum mRNA from adult female C57BL/6J (B6) mice were analyzed by RNA sequencing of 3 biological replicates for each of the 4 stages of the estrous cycle using an Illumina HiSeq 2500.",

Unsupervised cluster analysis using genes involved in apoptosis (N=246) resulted in 3 separate DLBCL groups partly overlapping with GCB versus ABC like phenotype. One group with poor clinical outcome was characterized by high expression levels of pro-and anti-apoptotic genes involved in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.

Of 11 genes considered to be neuroendocrine cell-specific, only ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1(UCHL1), a member of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, was consistently upregulated in smokers compared to nonsmokers. Up-regulation of UCHL1 at the protein level was observed with immunohistochemistry of bronchial biopsies of smokers compared to nonsmokers. Interestingly, however, while UCHL1 expression was present only in neuroendocrine cells of the airway epithelium in nonsmokers, UCHL1 expression was also expressed in ciliated epithelial cells in smokers, an intriguing observation in light of recent observations that ciliated cells can are capable of transdifferentiating to other airway epithelium. In the context that UCHL1 is involved in the degradation of unwanted, misfolded or damaged proteins within the cell and is overexpressed in >50% of lung cancers, its overexpression in chronic smokers may represent an early event in the complex transformation from normal epithelium to overt malignancy.Keywords: smokers vs non-smokers. comparison of gene expression in airway epithelial cells of the large airways of phenotypic normal smokers vs normal non-smokers.",

As these regions harbor glioma stem cells (GSCs), we investigated the epigenetic regulation of these two niches. Proneural, perivascular GSCs activated EZH2, whereas Mesenchymal GSCs in hypoxic regions expressed BMI1 protein, which promoted cellular survival under stress. Using both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition, we found that Proneural GSCs are selectively sensitive to EZH2 disruption, whereas Mesenchymal GSCs are sensitive to BMI1 inhibition. Given that glioblastomas contain both Proneural and Mesenchymal GSCs, combined EZH2 and BMI1 targeting proved more effective than either agent alone both in culture and in vivo, suggesting that strategies that simultaneously target multiple epigenetic regulators within glioblastomas may be necessary to overcome resistance to therapies caused by intratumoral heterogeneity.

We have previously shown that this model results in phenotypes relevant to FASD. Since ethanol is known to directly affect the expression of genes in the developing brain leading to abnormal cell death, changes to cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, and potential changes to epigenetic patterning, we hypothesize that there will be gene expression changes immediately following acute ethanol exposure in the fetal brain.We used a microarray experiment and focused on the genes identified to evaluate the genome-wide alterations to the fetal brain transcriptome caused by prenatal ethanol exposure. To generate samples, female C57BL/6J mice were given ethanol injections (2.5g/kg of ethanol in saline) twice on gestational days 14 and 16 to produce acute ethanol exposure effects.

We find that mRNAs are recruited into P granules by condensation with the intrinsically-disordered protein MEG-3. MEG-3 binds ~500 mRNAs in C. elegans embryos in a sequence-independent manner that favors mRNAs with low ribosome coverage. Translational stress causes additional mRNAs to localize to P granules and translational activation correlates with P granule exit for two mRNAs coding for germ cell fate regulators. MEG-3/RNA condensates assembled in vitro are gel-like and trap mRNAs in a non-dynamic state. Our observations reveal similarities between P granules and stress granules and identify gelation with intrinsically-disordered proteins as a sequence-independent mechanism to enrich low-translation mRNAs in RNA granules.

The aims of this study were to examine mRNA transcript levels of regulators of GGR and to investigate the downstream effect on global transcript expression in melanoma cell lines after cisplatin treatment and in melanoma tumours. One melanocyte, three primary melanoma (MM200, IgR3, Me4405) and two metastatic melanoma (Mel-RM and Sk-mel-28) cell lines were treated with cispltain and gene expression profile data collected at 0, 6 and 24 hours.

However, long-term analysis of human iPSC-derived DA neurons in primate PD models has never been performed.

Magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography were useful to monitor the survival and function of the DA neurons. Score-based and video-recording analyses revealed an increase in spontaneous movement of the monkeys after transplantation. Histological studies showed that the mature DA neurons extended dense neurites into the host striatum. In addition, we never observed tumor formation for two years. Thus, this preclinical study using primate models indicates that human iPSC-derived DA progenitors are clinically applicable to treat PD patients. 8 human iPSC-derived dopaminergic neuron progenitors, 2 undifferentiated human iPSCs, human fetal ventral mesencephalon, dorsal mesencephalon, adult whole brain and adult substantia nigra were subjected to RNA extraction and hybrdization on Affymetrix microarrays.",

Obesity-associated lipid overload triggers non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD), which in part may be driven by alterations of regulatory transcription networks and hepatocyte-selective epigenomes. Here we demonstrate that G protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2), a subunit of the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCOR)/ histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) complex, is a central component of such networks and accelerates the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In hepatocyte-specific Gps2 knockout mice, loss of GPS2 alleviated the development of diet-induced steatosis and fibrosis and caused activation of lipid catabolic genes. By determining differential cistromes, epigenomes and transcriptomes in wild-type, single and double knockout mice, we identified the lipid-sensing nuclear receptor PPARa as a direct target of GPS2. We also provide evidence that in hepatocytes, unlike in macrophages, GPS2 acts in concert with the NCOR subunit of the corepressor complex. By analyzing the liver transcriptomes of human patients, we found that GPS2 expression positively correlated with the expression of NASH/fibrosis signature genes. Collectively, our data suggest that the GPS2-PPARa partnership in hepatocytes may influence the development of NASH/fibrosis in mice and in humans. Transcriptome signatures of GPS2-regulated genes between WT and LKO livers was assessed through RNA-seq analysis. Epigenomic status of Gps2, Ncor and Smrt LKO vs WT livers was analyzed using histone markers H3K4me3 and/or H3K27ac ChIP-seq.

Relevant data from previous studies indicate that the number of genes regulated by glucocorticoid receptor exceeds 4000 in cells and that 358 different genes are regulated in the liver of adrenalectomized males rats treated with a chronic infusion of methylprednisolone for up to 1 week . However, differences in gene expression between males and females in response to glucocorticoid treatment in isolated hepatocytes are not known. Livers were isolated from adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats and digested with the collagenase perfusion method developed by Berry and Friend (J Cell Biol 43, 506-520;1969).

Estrogens and progesterone control mammary gland development and breast carcinogenesis via their cognate receptors expressed in a subset of cells of the luminal layer of the mammary epithelium. The extracellular matrix (ECM) including the basement membrane (BM) is important in breast physiology and tumorigenesis but how epithelial hormone receptor signaling and ECM are linked mechanistically is unclear. We identify the secreted protease Adamts18 as critical intermediary. Luminal estrogen and progesterone receptor signaling via upregulation of Wnt4 expression and ensuing canonical Wnt signaling activation in basal cells control Adamts18 expression there. The protease has an epithelial-intrinsic role in stem cell activation. We identify multiple binding partners in the interstitial ECM and BM and show that ADAMTS18 cleaves fibronectin in vitro. Its deletion results in increased fibronectin, collagen I and IV, and laminin deposition in pubertal glands. Adamts18 interacts genetically with Col18a1, which encodes a proteoglycan that is BM-specific, in stem cell regulation. Adamts18 inactivation impairs Hippo signaling and reduces Fgfr2 expression and signaling, which are vital for stem cell function. Our findings link epithelial hormone signaling to BM remodeling by Adamts18, and define the BM as an essential stem cell niche component.

Toward this goal, a judiciously chosen acute progesterone treatment regimen together with microarray methods was applied to the mammary gland of the normal mouse to uncover new effectors that operate immediately downstream of the progesterone mammary signal. Examination of the resultant progesterone-responsive transcriptome disclosed \"inhibitor of differentiation or DNA binding 4\" (Id4) as a molecular target acutely induced by progesterone in the murine mammary epithelium.Keywords: time course.

As many pathways linked to Alzheimer's disease are also linked to cholesterol metabolism, we also treated the Tg2576 mice with LXR agonist TO901317, to determine the effects of LXR agonists on the hippocampal transcriptome of Tg2576 mice.We used microarrays to identify gene expression modulated in hippocampus of transgenic TG2576 mice that express human APP containing the Swedish mutation and the transcriptional responses to treatment with an LXR agonist. 50 mg/kg of TO901317 was administered once per day for 7 days to 20 weeks old Tg2576 mice or non-transgenic littermates by oral gavage in 2% Tween 80 and 0.5% sodium carboxymethylcellulose. Control animals were dosed with vehicle. One hour after the final dose, the animals were sacrificed, saline perfused and the brains extracted. Each brain was hemisected and the hippocampus dissected. The right hippocampus were processed for RNA extraction and hybridized to the MOE430 2.0 array.",

Metals have been used for coronary artery stent materials in order to prevent stenosis caused by atherosclerosis. Degradable metallic materials (DMMs) are considered to be useful to avoid in-stent restenosis and late thrombosis. A new DMM, Fe-35Mn alloy, was fabricated through powder metallurgy in order to satisfy the ideal criteria of cardiovascular stent made of DMM. Since in-stent restenosis is mediated by the extracellular matrix production, which is mostly regulated by fibroblasts, the gene expression profile of 3T3 fibroblasts in the presence of Fe-35Mn alloy was then investigated. The mechanism of cellular responses in the presence of DMM is then expected to be clearly described through the gene profiling experiment. 3T3 fibroblast cells derived from mouse (Mus musculus) embryo (BALB/3T3 clone A31, ATTC) were put in the culture and treated with iron, manganese, and Fe-35Mn alloy for 24 hour in parallel and followed by the RNA extraction.

Progressive failure of insulin-producing beta cells is the central event leading to diabetes, yet the signalling networks controlling beta cell fate remain poorly understood. Here we show that SRp55, a splicing factor regulated by the diabetes susceptibility gene GLIS3, has a major role in maintaining function and survival of human beta cells. RNA-seq analysis revealed that SRp55 regulates the splicing of genes involved in cell survival and death, insulin secretion and JNK signalling. Specifically, SRp55-mediated splicing changes modulate the function of the pro-apoptotic proteins BIM and BAX, JNK signalling and endoplasmic reticulum stress, explaining why SRp55 depletion triggers beta cell apoptosis. Furthermore, SRp55 depletion inhibits beta cell mitochondrial function, explaining the observed decrease in insulin release. These data unveil a novel layer of regulation of human beta cell function and survival, namely alternative splicing modulated by key splicing regulators such as SRp55 that may crosstalk with candidate genes for diabetes.

Fourteen (30%) of the 46 genes also were differentially expressed in laser-capture micro-dissected corresponding primary tumor stroma compared to the matched normal lung.

To test if inhibition of CTGF would alter the course of cardiac remodeling and preserve cardiac function in the protein kinase Ce (PKCe) mouse model of DCM.

Purpose: There is substantial heterogeneity within the human papillomavirus (HPV) positive head and neck cancer (HNC) tumors that predispose them to different outcomes, however this subgroup is poorly characterized due to various historical reasons. Experimental Design: we perform unsupervised gene expression clustering on well-annotated HPV(+) HNC samples from two cohorts ( 84 total primary tumors), as well as 18 HPV(-) HNCs, to discover subtypes, and begin to characterize the differences between the subtypes in terms of their HPV characteristics, pathway activity, whole-genome somatic copy number variations and mutation frequencies. Results: We identified two distinctive HPV(+) subtypes by unsupervised clustering. Membership in the HPV(+) subtypes correlates with genic viral integration status, E2/E4/E5 expression levels and the ratio of spliced to full length HPV oncogene E6. The subtypes also show differences in copy number alterations, in particular the loss of chr16q and gain of chr3q, PIK3CA mutation, and in the expression of genes involved in several biological processes related to cancer, including immune response, oxidation-reduction process, and keratinocyte and mesenchymal differentiation. Conclusion: Our characterization of two subtypes of HPV(+) tumors provides valuable molecular level information in relation to the alternative paths to tumor development and to that of HPV(-) HNCs. Together, these results will shed light on stratifications of the HPV(+) HNCs and will help to guide personalized care for HPV(+) HNC patients. 36 head and neck primary tumors (18 HPV+ and 18 HPV-) and their matched blood samples were collected and genotyped by Illumina OmniExpress SNP array.

Natural killer (NK) cells can be divided into phenotypic subsets based on the expression of receptors that bind self-MHC-I molecules with differing affinities; a concept termed licensing or education. Here we show that NK cell subsets exhibit markedly different migratory, effector, and immunoregulatory functions on dendritic cells and antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses during influenza and murine cytomegalovirus infections. Shortly after infection, unlicensed NK cells preferentially trafficked to draining lymph nodes and produced GM-CSF, which promoted the expansion and activation of dendritic cells, and ultimately resulted in sustained antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. In contrast, licensed NK cells preferentially migrated to infected parenchymal tissues and produced greater levels of interferon-g (IFN-g). Importantly, human NK cell subsets exhibited similar phenotypic characteristics and patterns of cytokine production. Collectively, our studies demonstrate a critical demarcation between the functions of licensed and unlicensed NK cell subsets, with the former functioning as the classical effector subset in inflamed tissues and the latter as modulators of adaptive immunity helping to prime immune responses in draining lymph nodes. Gene expression profiling of isolated pools of unlicensed (Ly49-negative, Ly49G2/A+) and licensed (Ly49C/I+) NK cells was performed in order to confirm the unique phenotypic and functional characteristics of these subsets.

    "text": "Comparative tissue gene expression profiling and alternative splicing by exon-sensitive microarrays in non-syndromic craniosynostosis. Craniosynostosis (CS) is the congenital premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures and represents the more prevalent craniofacial malformation in humans, with an overall incidence of 1 out of 2000-3000 live births. Non-syndromic craniosynostoses (NSC) are believed to be multifactorial disorders, with a strong genetic component, due to possible gene-gene or gene-environment interactions that remain to be clearly identified. In this study we delved into the molecular signaling acting in calvarial tissue and cells from patients affected by nonsynodromic midline craniosynostosis, using a comparative analysis between fused and unfused sutures of each affected individuals. Using comparative microarray tissue gene expression profiling we have identified a subset of genes involved in the structure and function of the primary cilium, including the Bardet-Biedl syndrome 9 (BBS9) gene, which was recently associated to sagittal synostosis in a GWAS study. We therefore characterized BBS9 expression and cilium-related signaling in cells isolated from patients' calvarial bone. 5 patients affected by nonsynodromic sagittal synostosis or nonsyndromic metopic synostosis were enrolled in this study. Tissue specimens were collected, from each patients, both from patent and fused calvarial sutures and cryopreservated in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from snap-frozen calvarial tissue specimens using pestel and TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), and subsequently purified using silica membrane spin columns from RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). The yield, quality and integrity of RNA were determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). The resulting total RNA was then used to created the biotin-labeled library to be hybridized on GeneChip(r) Exon 1.0 ST human microarrays following the procedure described by the manufacturer (Affymetrix). The CEL files resulting from the hybridization were analyzed using oneChannelGUI 1.6.5 (Sanges et al. Bioinformatics 2007, 23, 3406-3408). Exon and gene-level probeset summarization was done by mean of RMA and sketch quantile normalization. Gene-level differential expression: to assess differential expression at gene-level, we used an empirical Bayes method together with a false discovery rate (FDR) correction of the p-value Thus, the list of differentially expressed genes was generated using an FDR <= 0.05 together with an absolute log2(fold-change) threshold of 1. Exon-level analysis: an intensity filter was subsequently applied at gene-level to remove not expressed and low expressed genes, i.e. genes were retained for exon-level analysis if in all biological replication gene-level signal was greater than 5. Subsequently, only genes characterized to have at least two RNA isoforms annotated in Ensembl database were retained for further analysis. The Splicing Index value was calculated by taking the log2 ratio of the normalized exon intensity (NI) in Sample 1 and the NI in Sample 2. The normalized exon intensity (NI) is the ratio of the probe set intensity to the gene intensity. Alternative splicing events (ASEs) were detected as described in (Della Beffa et al.

Purpose: To gain insight into genomic and trancriptomic subtypes of ductal carcinomas in situ of the breast (DCIS).Results: Thirty-two DCIS exhibited a luminal phenotype; 21were ERBB2 positive, and 4 were ERBB2/estrogen receptor (ER) negativewith1harboring a bona fide basal-like phenotype.Based on a CGHanalysis, genomic types were identified in this series of DCISwith the 1q gain/16q loss combination observed in 3 luminal DCIS, themixed amplifier pattern including all ERBB2,12 luminal and 1ERBB2/ER- DCIS, and the complex copy number alteration profile encompassing 14 luminal and 1ERBB2/ER- DCIS. Eight cases (8 of 57; 14%) presented aTP53 mutation, all being amplifiers. Unsupervised analysis of gene expression profiles of 26 of the 57 DCIS showed that luminal and ERBB2-amplified, ER-negative cases clustered separately.We further investigated the effect of high and low copy number changes on gene expression. Strikingly, amplicons but also low copy number changes especially on 1q, 8q, and 16q in DCIS regulated the expression of a subset of genes in a very similar way to that recently described in invasive ductal carcinomas.Conclusions: These combined approaches show that the molecular heterogeneity of breast ductal carcinomas exists already in in situ lesions and further indicate that DCIS and invasive ductal carcinomas share genomic alterations with a similar effect on gene expression profile. Experimental Design: We did a combined phenotypic and genomic analysis of a series of 57 DCIS integrated with gene expression profile analysis for 26 of the 57 cases.vince-00013Assay Type: Gene ExpressionProvider: AffymetrixArray Designs: HG-U133AOrganism: Homo sapiens (ncbitax)Tissue Sites: Breast, BreastMaterial Types: cDNA, genomic_DNA, total_RNACell Types: Ductal carcinoma in situDisease States: Breast Carcinoma.",

The survival of isolated metastatic cells and expansion into macroscopic tumour has been recognized as a limiting step for metastasis formation in several cancer types yet the determinants of this process remain largely uncharacterized. In colorectal cancer (CRC), we identify a transcriptional programme in tumour-associated stromal cells, which is intimately linked to a high risk of developing recurrent disease after therapy. A large proportion of CRCs display mutational inactivation of the TGF-beta pathway but paradoxically they are characterized by high TGF-beta production. In these tumours, TGF-beta instructs a transcriptional programme in stromal cells, which confers a high risk of developing metastatic disease.We purified by FACS CD31(+), CD45(+), FAP(+) and Epcam(+) populations from fresh CRC samples and assessed their gene expression profiles. Freshly obtained tumours from 6 CRC patients treated at Hospital del Mar or Hospital Clinic (Barcelona, Spain) were minced and incubated with Collagenase IV (100 U mL-1). Enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding 10% FBS, single cells were collected by sequential filtering and resuspended in ammonium chloride (0.15M) to lyse erythrocytes.

Studies using low-resolution methods to assess gene expression during preimplantation mouse development indicate that changes in gene expression either precede or occur concomitantly with the major morphological transitions, that is, conversion of the oocyte to totipotent 2-cell blastomeres, compaction, and blastocyst formation. Using microarrays, we characterized global changes in gene expression and used Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE) to identify biological and molecular processes that accompany and likely underlie these transitions. The analysis confirmed previously described processes or events, but more important, EASE revealed new insights. Response to DNA damage and DNA repair genes are overrepresented in the oocyte compared to 1-cell through blastocyst stages and may reflect the oocyte's response to selective pressures to insure genomic integrity; fertilization results in changes in the transcript profile in the 1-cell embryo that are far greater than previously recognized; and genome activation during 2-cell stage may not be as global and promiscuous as previously proposed, but rather far more selective, with genes involved in transcription and RNA processing being preferentially expressed.

During male development, the testes move from a high intraabdominal position and descend into the scrotum. The gubernaculum, an inguinoscrotal ligament connecting the testis to the lower abdomen, is believed to play a critical role in this process. The first stage of testicular descent is controlled by INSL3, insulin like3 hormone, produced in testicular Leydig cells. Deletion of Insl3 or its receptor, Rxfp2, in mice causes cryptorchidism. We produced Cre/loxP regulated shRNA transgenic mice targeting RXFP2 expression. We have shown that the transgene was able to reduce Rxfp2 gene expression and thus behaved as a hypomorphic allele of Rxfp2. Variable degrees of uni-and bilateral cryptorchidism was detected in males with the activated shRNA transgene on an Rxfp2+/- background. Conditional suppression of Rxfp2 in the gubernaculum led to cryptorchidism. Gene expression analysis of a mutant cremasteric sac using Illumina microarrays indicated abnormal expression of a significant number of genes in Wnt/b-catenin and Notch pathways. We have demonstrated profound changes in the expression pattern of b-catenin, Notch1, desmin, and androgen receptor (AR) in Rxfp2-/- male embryos, indicating the role of INSL3 in proliferation, differentiation, and survival of specific cellular components of the gubernaculum. We have shown that INSL3/RXFP2 signaling is essential for myogenic differentiation and maintenance of AR-positive cells in the gubernaculum. Males with the deletion of b-catenin or Notch1 in the gubernacular ligament demonstrated abnormal development. Our data indicates that b-catenin and Notch pathways are potential targets of INSL3 signaling during gubernacular development.

Resistance towards anti-angiogenic therapy (AAT) still represents a substantial clinical challenge. We report here that tumor-infiltrating mast cells (MC) are powerful mediators decreasing efficacy of AAT in mice and cancer patients. They act in a cell-extrinsic manner by secreting granzyme B, which liberates pro-angiogenic mediators from the extracellular matrix. In addition, MC also diminish efficacy of anti-angiogenic agents in a cell-autonomous way, which can be blocked by the mast cell degranulation inhibitor cromolyn. Our findings are relevant in humans because patients harboring higher numbers of MC in their tumors have an inferior outcome after anti-angiogenic treatment in the Gepar Quinto randomized Phase 3 clinical trial. Thus, MC-targeting might represent a novel promising approach to increase efficacy of AAT. Panc02 cells were injected subcutanously into the flanks of C57BL/6J mice.

The main aim of this study was the establishment of an in vitro model of the non-keratinized mucous membrane that can be used as a standardized tool to evaluate biological and therapeutic effects of pharmaceuticals for mucosal wound healing. Performing histological and immunofluorescence analyses with known differentiation markers we proved that our model mimics the two distinctive layers of the mucous membrane - the stratified squamous epithelium and the lamina propria. In our study we used our model to investigate molecular effects of a dexpanthenol-containing ointment that is widely used in the wound treatment of the oral mucosa. For that purpose our model exhibits a unique feature in that dexpanthenol and proliferation enhancing additives that may interfere with our studies are not required for the maintenance of the model culture. After setting standardized lesions with a CO2 laser, topical treatment with the dexpanthenol-containing ointment enhanced wound closure in our non-keratinized mucous membrane model compared to placebo and untreated controls. Furthermore, microarray analysis revealed that the treatment of our laser wounded model with the dexpanthenol-containing ointment evoked an upregulated expression of various genes related to accelerated wound healing. Overall, we verified that our mucous membrane model can be utilized in future to monitor ex vivo effects of various topical therapies on mucosa morphology, physiology, and gene expression. Our findings confirm the potential of the non-keratinized mucous membrane model as an in vitro tool for the replacement of pharmacological in vivo studies regarding mucosal wound healing. Two samples were analyzed: Comparison between 3D mucous membrane model after laser injury and treatment with the dexpanthenol-containing vs. the placebo treated control.",

Background: Intrinsic glioma subtypes (IGS) are molecularly similar tumors that can be identified based on unsupervised gene-expression analysis. Here, we have evaluated the clinical relevance of these subtypes within EORTC26951, a randomized phase III clinical trial investigating adjuvant procarbazine, CCNU (lomustine) and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy in anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors. Our study is the first to include gene-expression profiles of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) clinical trial samples. Methods: Gene-expression profiling was performed in 140 samples: 47 fresh frozen and 93 FFPE, on HU133_Plus_2.0 and HuEx_1.0_st arrays (Affymetrix), respectively. Results: All previously identified six intrinsic glioma subtypes are present in EORTC26951. This confirms that different molecular subtypes are present within a well-defined histological subtype. Intrinsic subtypes are highly prognostic for overall- (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). They are prognostic for PFS independent of clinical (age, performance, tumor location), molecular (1p19qLOH, IDH1 mutation, MGMT methylation) and histological parameters. Combining known molecular (1p19LOH, IDH1) prognostic parameters with intrinsic subtypes improves outcome prediction (Proportion of Explained Variation 30% v 23%). Specific genetic changes (IDH1, 1p19qLOH and EGFR amplification) segregate into different subtypes. We identified one subtype, IGS-9 (characterized by a high percentage of 1p19qLOH and IDH1 mutations), that especially benefits from PCV chemotherapy. Median OS in this subtype was 5.5 years after radiotherapy (RT) alone v 12.8 years after RT/PCV; P=0.0349; HR 2.18, 95% CI [1.06, 4.50]. Conclusion: Intrinsic subtypes are highly prognostic in EORTC26951 and improve outcome prediction when combined with other prognostic factors. Tumors assigned to IGS-9 benefit from adjuvant PCV. A total of 140 samples were included in this study, profiles of 95 were FFPE derived samples run on exon arrays. 12 samples (part 2) can also be found in GSE16011 (PMID 19920198 and 16357140), and 6 from Oncomine (part 3).",

Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide with increasing incidence, the presence of metastasis is one of the major causes for poor outcome. BEX2 has been reported to be involved in tumor development in several types of cancer, but is poorly understood in metastatic colorectal cancer. Here we demonstrated that knockout of BEX2 resulted in the enhancement of the migratory and metastatic potential of colorectal cancer cells in vivo and in vitro, re-expression of BEX2 in knockout cells could reverse the migratory enhancement. Expression profile chip indicated that hedgehog signaling pathway was activated after knockout of BEX2, and hedgehog Signaling inhibitor GANT61 and GDC-0449 could somehow reverse the migratory enhancement of BEX2-/- colorectal cancer cells. We also demonstrated that it is the nucleus translocation of Zic2 after BEX2 silenced, that activated hedgehog signaling pathway, while knockdown Zic2 could also abrogated migratory enhancement of BEX2-/- cells. In summary, our findings suggest that BEX2 is a negative modulator of hedgehog signaling pathway by retaining Zic2 in the cytoplasm of colorectal cancer cells, thus to inhibit colorectal cancer cell migration and metastasis. mRNA profiles of colorectal cancer cell DLD1 (WT) and BEX2 knocked out DLD1 cells (DLD1 KO1 and DLD1 KO2) were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina Hiseq 3000.",

The transcriptome of 55 patient derived xenografts show that 30% of them share an exacerbated expression profile of MYC transcriptional targets (MYC-high). This cohort is characterized by a high level of Ki67 staining, a lower differentiation state and a shorter survival time compared to the MYC-low subgroup. To define classifier expression signature, we selected a group of 10 MYC targets transcripts which expression is increased in the MYC-high group and 6 transcripts increased in the MYC-low group. We validated the ability of these markers panel to identify MYC-high patient-derived xenografts from both: discovery and validation cohorts as well as primary cells cultures from the same patients. We then showed that cells from MYC-high patients are more sensitive to JQ1 treatment compared to MYC-low cells, in both monolayer and 3D cultured spheroids, due to cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis. Therefore, these results provide new markers and potentially novel therapeutic modalities for distinct subgroups of pancreatic tumors and may find application to the future management of these patients within the setting of individualized medicine clinics. 30 primary Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors obtained from surgery and 25 biopsy samples taken by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) were implanted subcutaneously into mice and preserved as Patient Derived Xenografts (PDX).

The epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a visceral adipose tissue in close contact with coronary vessels whose increase is associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). Our goal was to identify candidate molecule(s) characterizing EAT which could intervene in the pathogenesis of CAD. An approach combining microarrays and bioinformatic sequence analysis tools for predicting secreted proteins (TargetP) was applied to paired biopsies of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and EAT, obtained from patients with or without CAD (NCAD). Results were validated in 3 independent groups of subjects by RT-qPCR, western blot, immuno histochemistry and explants secretion. sPLA2-IIA ranked first among genes coding for potentially secreted proteins with the highest overexpression in EAT in both CAD and NCAD. RT-qPCR confirmed its increased expression in EAT ( p<0.01) and in EAT from CAD as compared to NCAD (49.3 +-13 vs. 17.4 +- 9.7 p<0.01). sPLA2-IIA protein level was higher in EAT than in SAT. EAT explants demonstrated also significantly higher sPLA2-IIA secretion levels than SAT ones (4.37+-2.7 vs 0.67+- 0.28 ng.ml-1/g tissue/24h,p<0.03). sPLA2-IIA labeling was evidenced in EAT in the stroma vascular fraction between adipocytes and in connective capsules, with no immunostaining of the adipocytes. SAT was weakly labeled following the same pattern.Conclusion: We evidenced for the first time an increased expression of sPLA2-IIA in EAT from patients with CAD, a phospholipase that was shown to be an independent risk factor for CAD. These findings suggest a potentially pathophysiological role of EAT in CAD. We studied three independent groups of subjects. Group 1 and 2 were composed of 30 subjects who underwent cardiac surgery for coronary artery disease (CAD) or for valve replacement, or myxoma resection (NCAD). Patients from the NCAD group had no clinical or angiographic sign of CAD, and had a left ventricular ejection fraction > 50%. Group 3 was composed of 15 non diabetic patients with CAD. EAT and SAT samples were obtained within 20 min after the start of surgery respectively near the proximal tract of the right coronary artery and the site of chest incision. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 degC. In groups 1 and 2, total RNA obtained from SAT and EAT samples of 7 subjects (4 CAD and 3 NCAD) was prepared using the RNeasy total RNA Mini kit (Qiagen). RNA concentration and integrity were assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Massy, France). For microarray experiments, 1 ug of total RNA from each total RNA sample preparation was amplified by MessageAmp RNA Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) and 3 ug of amplified RNA was labeled with cyanin dyes (Cy) using the CyScribe First-Strand cDNA labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Orsay, France). (available at http://cmgm.stanford.edu/pbrown/protocols/index). Using pangenomic Agilent(r) cDNA microarrays, we compared the expression profiles of EAT and SAT from CAD and NCAD subjects. To this purpose we used a common reference pool that was generated by mixing equal amounts of total RNA extracted from adipose tissue samples of patients undergoing plastic surgery. Amplified RNA (aRNA) from the reference pool was labeled with Cy3, and aRNA from the 7 subjects (either EAT or SAT) was labeled with Cy5. A total of 13 pangenomic microarray hybridizations were performed for this differential comparison.

Purpose: The goal of this study is to examine gene expression regulation at the transcriptional and translational levels in response to various forms of nutrient deprivation, and whether there are differences between isogenic transformed and non-transformed cells.Mehods: We apply high-throughput sequencing of ribosome footprints (ribosome profiling) and poly(A) RNA (RNA sequencing) in an isogenic pair of transformed (tamoxifen-treated) and non-transformed (ethanol control) MCF10A-ER-Src cells subjected to the metabolic stresses that differentially affect global protein synthesis (Figure 1): deprivation of glutamine (for 30min and 4 hours), glucose (4hours), cysteine/cystine (4hours) or leucine/isoleucine/valine (brach-chain aminoacids - BCAA) (4hours). The same experiments were also performed in transformed ER-Src MCF10A treated with torin1 (500nM) for 4 hours.Results: Genome-wide translational profiling of glutamine deprived ER-Src MCF10A cells (for 30 minutes) shows increased translation of uORFs-containing mRNAs and down-regulation of ribosomal protein mRNAs, which is followed by increased translation and transcription of cytokine and inflammatory mRNAs (after 4 hours of glutamine deprivation). The transcription and translation of inflammatory and cytokine mRNAs is also stimulated in response to 4 hours deprivation of glucose, cysteine/cystine and BCAA, with the extent of stimulation correlating with the i) decrease in global protein synthesis and ii) down-regulation of all translationally-repressed mRNAs or ribosomal protein mRNAs.Conclusions: Pro-inflammatory gene expression is associated with translational repression in response to short-term nutrient deprivation. Ribosome occupancy and mRNAs levels in transformed and non-transformed cells cultured for i) 30 minutes under complete (Ctrl) or glutamine-free (NoQ) DMEM medium, and ii) 4 hours under complete (Ctrl), glucose-free (NoG), glutamine-free (NoQ), cysteine/cystine-free (NoCys) or leucine, isoleucine, valine (NoBCAA)-free DMEM medium. The translation efficiency (TE) was calculated as the log2 ratio of RPKM measured by ribosome profiling over RPKM measured by RNA-seq. Differences in ribosome occupancy (RO) and TE between the metabolic stress condition and the reference sample (either TAM or EtOH cells grown in complete DMEM) were used to examine the transcriptional and translational changes, respectively. The ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing experiments were performed in duplicate with the exception of RNA-seq at 30 minutes (single experiments), ribosome profiling in cysteine/cystine-deprived EtOH cells (triplicate experiments), and the Torin1 ribosome profiling and RNA-seq (single experiment).

Post-translational regulation of the MYC Transcription Factor (TF), including its phosphorylation and ubiquitination, plays an important role in determining cell proliferation and apoptosis and has been implicated in tumorigenesis. Using a computational systems biology approach, followed by biochemical and functional validation, we have characterized the role of the STK38 kinase, an NDR family serine-threonine kinase, as a key modulator of MYC transcriptional activity in human B cells, affecting MYC protein stability in a signal-dependent fashion. Specifically, we show that in human B lymphoma ST486 cells STK38 is a key mediator of BCR pathway signaling, affecting MYC protein turnover and its phosphorylation at Ser62 in kinase-activity-dependent manner. STK38 inactivation abrogates apoptosis following BCR activation while its silencing mediates MYC protein degradation via canonical proteolytic pathways. This suggests that STK38 could provide an effective therapeutic target in MYC-dependent malignancies. ST486 human Burkitt's lymphoma cells were transduced with STK38 shRNA lentiviral vectors.",

Chronic neuropathic pain is a major morbidity of neural injury, yet its mechanisms are incompletely understood. Hypersensitivity to previously non-noxious stimuli (allodynia) is a common symptom. Here, we demonstrate that the onset of cold hypersensitivity precedes tactile allodynia and this temporal divergence was associated with major differences in global gene expression in dorsal root ganglia. Transcripts whose expression correlate with the onset of cold allodynia were nociceptor-related whereas those correlating with tactile hypersensitivity were enriched for immune cell activity. Selective ablation of TrpV1 lineage nociceptors resulted in mice that did not acquire cold allodynia but developed normal tactile hypersensitivity. Whereas depletion of macrophages or T cells reduced neuropathic tactile allodynia but not cold hypersensitivity. We conclude that neuropathic pain is contributed to by reactive processes of sensory neurons and immune cells, each leading to distinct forms of pain hypersensitivity, potentially allowing effective drug development targeted to each pain modality. High temporal analysis of global gene expression in the DRG following spared nerve injury (SNI) correlated with behavior taken at the same time points.

    "text": "R-spondin 3 regulates stem cell plasticity and recovery of damaged colon epithelium. The gastrointestinal epithelial crypts are clonal units with a high cell turnover, driven by a small population of long-lived, Lgr5-expressing stem cells located in the crypt base. Despite this, depletion of Lgr5+ cells does not lead to severe pathology. Instead, other cell populations, such as secretory and enterocyte precursors are able to de-differentiate, replace Lgr5+ cells, and regenerate the crypt. However, the signals that regulate this epithelial plasticity are not well understood. Here we illuminate the hierarchical organization and regulation of stem cell plasticity in the colonic crypt. Using in vivo lineage tracing, we find that the classic Wnt target gene Axin2 is expressed in colonic Lgr5+ cells and adjacent Lgr5-negative cells that give rise to entire crypts upon Lgr5+ cell depletion. The identity of Lgr5+ cells is controlled by by R-spondin 3 (Rspo3) produced by myofibroblasts and the recovery of Lgr5+ cells upon depletion required functional Rspo3 signaling. In contrast, expression of Axin2 and the reserve stem cell function of Axin2+ cells is not dependent on Rspo3. Accordingly, upon knockout of Rspo3, Lgr5-negative Axin2+ cells are able to compensate the loss of the Lgr5+ cell compartment and maintain epithelial integrity. In contrast, Rspo3 is essential for maintaining epithelial integrity in the context of injury of the entire Axin2+ cell pool, as observed in the context of DSS colitis. We demonstrate that DSS induces a progressive loss of the Lgr5+ stem cells as well as Axin2+ Lgr5-negative reserve stem cell compartment. While Rspo3 deficient animals are unable to withstand this injury, in Rspo3 competent animals, crypt homeostasis and regeneration are fueled by the remaining Axin2-negative, differentiated cells. These cells can be reprogrammed by Rspo3 to proliferate and act as stem cells. Thus, we identity Rspo3 as a major regulator of the Lgr5 stem cell signature. While loss of this signature can be compensated by Rspo3-independent reserve stem cells under healthy conditions, it is essential for re-establishment of epithelial integrity upon crypt injury. Tamoxifen (Sigma) was injected intraperitoneally into mice either as single dose or on three consecutive days (4 mg/25 g bodyweight, diluted in 200 ul corn oil) at the indicated time points to deplete Rspo3 expression.C57BL/6 Axin2CreErt2/Rosa26-tdTomato cells were sorted using the BD FACSAria II.

Our aim was to find an effective treatment for the dysfunction in energy regulation and hypothalamic integrity occurring in many Huntington's disease (HD) patients and mouse models. HD is a neurodegenerative disease caused by an expanded CAG repeat and is characterized by mutant huntingtin aggregates, cell death, progressive motor impairment, and cognitive alterations. Changes in neuroendocrine function, body weight, energy metabolism, euglycemia, appetite function, sleep, and gut function can also occur. It is likely that the locus of these alterations is the hypothalamus. Male B6C3-Tg(HD82Gln)81Dbo/J (N171-82Q) mice and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice were used. Transgenic mice were identified by PCR analysis of tail DNA. N171-82Q mice express 82 polyglutamine repeats and display multiple Huntington's disease-like symptoms. Either Ex-4 (n=10, 300 uL of 0.1 umol/L solution, Bachem, Torrance, CA), the GLP-1-transferrin hybrid molecule (n=10, GLP-1Tf, 1mg/kg), insulin (n=10, 5Units, Lantus) or a saline vehicle treatment (n=10, phosphate buffered saline, PBS; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was administered by a once-daily subcutaneous injection. Injections were started when animals were pre-symptomatic (2 months of age) and continued for 5 weeks. 3 Mice from each treatment qroup were used for the microarray analysis. RNA was extracted from frozen hypothalamus tissue using 1.0mm glass beads (BioSpec Products, Inc.) in a Precellys 24 Tissue Homogenizer (Bertin Technologies) and Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kits according to manufacturer's specifications. Quality and quantity of the total RNA was checked with the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer using RNA 6000 Nano chips. The standard Illumina protocol using Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion; Austin, TX, cat # IL1791) was used to biotin label the aRNA generated and then hybridized to Illumina's Sentrix MouseRef-8 v2 Expression BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA).

Biologically and clinically meaningful tumor classification schemes have long been sought. Some malignant epithelial neoplasms, such as those in the thyroid and endometrium, exhibit more than one pattern of differentiation, each associated with distinctive clinical features and treatments. In other tissues, all carcinomas, regardless of morphological type, are treated as though they represent a single disease. To better understand the biological and clinical features seen in the four major histological types of ovarian carcinoma (OvCa), we analyzed gene expression in 113 ovarian epithelial tumors using oligonucleotide microarrays. Global views of the variation in gene expression were obtained using PCA. These analyses show that mucinous and clear cell OvCas can be readily distinguished from serous OvCas based on their gene expression profiles, regardless of tumor stage and grade. In contrast, endometrioid adenocarcinomas show significant overlap with other histological types. Although high-stage/grade tumors are generally separable from low-stage/grade tumors, clear cell OvCa has a molecular signature that distinguishes it from other poor-prognosis OvCas. Indeed, 73 genes, expressed 2- to 29-fold higher in clear cell OvCas compared with each of the other OvCa types, were identified. Collectively, the data indicate that gene expression patterns in ovarian adenocarcinomas reflect both morphological features and biological behavior. Moreover, these studies provide a foundation for the development of new type-specific diagnostic strategies and treatments for ovarian cancer. cho-00156Assay Type: Gene ExpressionProvider: AffymetrixArray Designs: Hu6800Organism: Homo sapiens (ncbitax)Material Types: synthetic_RNA, organism_part, whole_organism, total_RNADisease States: Ovary cancer.",

Given the positive results of quercetin in in vitro genotoxicity studies, it is of interest to test the in vivo genotoxicity of this important dietary flavonoid, especially considering possible high intake by widely available supplements. In the present study quercetin was tested in a transcriptomic analysis for genotoxicity in liver and small intestine of mice. Quercetin (0.33%) supplemented to a high-fat diet was administered to mice during 12 weeks and compared with high-fat diet feeding. Serum ALT and AST levels revealed no indications for hepatotoxicity. General microarray pathway analysis of liver and small intestinal tissue samples showed no regulation of genotoxicity related pathways. In addition, analysis of DNA damage pathways in these samples, also did not point at genotoxicity. Furthermore, comparison with a published classifier set of transcripts for identifying genotoxic compounds did not reveal any similarities with the regulation of these classifier set of transcripts by quercetin, except for two of the transcripts which were regulated in opposite direction. Available microarray datasets of known genotoxic compounds, 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in mice were taken along as positive controls for comparison, and indeed showed genotoxic properties (regulation of genotoxic related genes) in the analyses. This transcriptomic study showed that supplementation with quercetin at ~350 mg/kg bw/day for 12 weeks in mice gave no indications of quercetin-induced genotoxicity in liver and small intestine.

Tuberculosis (TB) remains the world's top infectious killer. Understanding how immune mediators determine the outcome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection could facilitate the design of better therapies against this devastating disease. GM-CSF mediates protective immunity against TB but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. To determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective role of GM-CSF during M. tuberculosis infection we performed RNA-sequencing analyses of whole blood and lung samples obtained from C57Bl/6 mice infected with HN878 and treated with anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibody or isotype control. Uninfected mice were also treated and used as uninfected controls. Three weeks post-infection, whole blood and lungs were harvested from each individual mouse and processed for RNA-sequencing. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that during M. tuberculosis infection GM-CSF regulates the expression of genes associated with neutrophil recruitment and activation and type I IFN-inducible genes, which have been previously associated with TB pathogenesis. Further mechanistical studies showed that disease exacerbation driven by GM-CSF blockade during M. tuberculosis infection was type I IFN and neutrophil-dependent and that over-activation of neutrophils by type I IFN induced NET formation at the site of infection. NETs were also found in necrotic lung lesions from patients with pulmonary TB and type I IFN-driven NET formation correlated with increased disease susceptibility in different mouse models of TB. Our findings reveal an important immune network that may play a central role in determining TB outcome. C57Bl/6 female mice were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain HN878 and treated with anti-GM-CSF monoconal antibody (aGM-CSF) or isotype control (iso) the day prior to infection and then twice a week during the course of the experiment. Uninfected mice were also treated and used as uninfected controls. Three weeks post-infection, whole blood and lungs from each individual mouse were harvested and processed for RNA-sequencing. A total of 39 blood and 39 lung samples were analysed.

Curiously, these conditions tend to involve specific areas of the central and peripheral nervous system, at least initially. For example, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis preferentially targets spinal motor neurons and spares oculomotor neurons. This suggests that aging has divergent effects on brain stem and spinal cord, a factor that may explain differential susceptibility to certain neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, for this study we asked whether aging induces a change in the evolution of the transcriptome of oculomotor nucleus (OMN) throughout the lifespan which would be different than that of the spinal cord aging. Age induced a transcriptome shift to a pattern consistent with inflammation/immune response in both OMN and spinal cord. However, the response was more dramatic in the spinal cord. On the other hand, age repressed genes coding ion channels and transporters in OMN and cytoskeletal proteins in the spinal cord. The results indicate that OMN and spinal cord transcriptomes change differently with age. The results give an initial glimpse of how tissue-specific gene expression patterns may underlie the differential susceptibility to age-related neuromuscular dysfunction.Keywords: time course, aging. Total RNA was obtained with TRIzol (Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturers recommended protocol.

Only genes with consistent absent/present calls in all four independent replicates per group were considered for further analysis. Comparisons used the 6-mo transcriptome as the baseline and the one-sided Wilcoxon's signed rank test to estimate \"increase/no change/ decrease\" difference calls for each pair-wise comparison. Only difference calls consistent in all pair-wise comparisons and with average changes > 1.70 were considered significant, resulting in a conservative list of genes with changed expression levels.

A major challenge of lineage conversion is to generate specific subtypes of cells, closely related cells with distinct properties.

We previously reported that a combination of three transcription factors, Ngn3, Mafa, and Pdx1, directly reprogram pancreatic acinar cells to b-cells. We now show that acinar cells can be converted to d-like and a-like cells by Ngn3 and Ngn3+Mafa respectively. Thus, three major islet endocrine subtypes can be derived by acinar reprogramming. Ngn3 promotes establishment of a generic endocrine state in acinar cells at the onset of reprogramming in addition to promoting d-specification. Mafa and Pdx1 suppress d-specification in a- and b-cell formation. These studies identify a set of defined factors whose combinatorial actions reprogram acinar cells to distinct islet endocrine subtypes in vivo. induced beta cells samples at day 10 collected for the microarray.",

In the present study, we evaluated the role of NT-PGC-1a in brown adipocyte energy metabolism by genome-wide profiling of NT-PGC-1a-responsive genes. Canonical pathway analysis revealed that a number of genes upregulated by NT-PGC-1a are highly enriched in mitochondrial pathways including fatty acid transport and b-oxidation, TCA cycle and electron transport system, thus reinforcing the crucial role of NT-PGC-1a in the enhancement of mitochondrial function. Moreover, gene expression profiling of NT-PGC-1a revealed activation of distinct metabolic pathways such as glucose, lipid and nucleotide metabolism and of signaling pathways such as RAR and PPAR-g/RXRa activation in brown adipocytes. Together, our data strengthen our previous findings that NT-PGC-1a is a key regulator of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and thermogenesis in brown adipocytes and further suggest that NT-PGC-1a influences a broader spectrum of thermogenic processes to meet cellular needs for adaptive thermogenesis.

To examine the reason for the frequent presence of multiple zinc fingers, we generated mice lacking finger 1 or finger 4 of the 4-finger DNA-binding domain of Ikaros, a critical regulator of lymphopoiesis and leukemogenesis.

The pervasive expression of circular RNA from protein coding loci is a recently discovered feature of many eukaryotic gene expression programs. Computational methods to discover and quantify circular RNA are essential to the study of the mechanisms of circular RNA biogenesis and potential functional roles they may play. In this paper, we present a new statistical algorithm that increases the sensitivity and specificity of circular RNA detection.by discovering and quantifying circular and linear RNA splicing events at both annotated exon boundaries and in un-annotated regions of the genome Unlike previous approaches which rely on heuristics like read count and homology between exons predicted to be circularized to determine confidence in prediction of circular RNA expression, our algorithm is a statistical approach. We have used this algorithm to discover general induction of circular RNAs in many tissues during human fetal development. We find that some regions of the brain show marked enrichment for genes where circular RNA is the dominant isoform. Beyond this global trend, specific circular RNAs are tissue specifically induced during fetal development, including a circular isoform of NCX1 in the developing fetal heart that, by 20 weeks, is more highly expressed than the linear isoform as well as beta-actin. In addition, while the vast majority of circular RNA production occurs at canonical U2 (major spliceosome) splice sites, we find the first examples of developmentally induced circular RNAs processed by the U12 (minor) spliceosome, and an enriched propensity of U12 donors to splice into circular RNA at un-annotated, rather than annotated, exons. Together, our algorithm and its results suggest a potentially significant role for circular RNA in human development. 35 human fetal samples from 6 tissues (3 - 7 replicates per tissue) collected between 10 and 20 weeks gestational time were sequenced using Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Gold sample prep kit.",

Side population (SP) cells are found in many types of cancer and are usually enriched in therapy-resistant as well as tumorigenic cells. Here, we identified a Hoechst dye-effluxing SP in a large series of human melanoma samples representing different progression phases. The SP size did not change with disease stage but was correlated with the prognostic \"Breslow's depth\" in the primary (cutaneous) tumors. When injected into immunodeficient mice, the SP generated larger tumors than the bulk \"main population\" (MP) melanoma cells in two consecutive generations, and showed tumorigenic capacity at lower cell numbers than the MP. In addition, the SP reconstituted the heterogeneous composition of the human A375 melanoma cell line, and its clonogenic activity was 2.5-fold higher than that of the MP. Gene-expression analysis revealed upregulated expression in the melanoma SP (versus the MP) of genes associated with chemoresistance and anti-apoptosis. Consistent with these molecular characteristics, the SP increased in proportion when A375 cells were exposed to the melanoma standard chemotherapeutic agent dacarbazine, and to the aggravating condition of hypoxia. In addition, the SP showed enhanced expression of genes related to cell invasion and migration, as well as to putative (melanoma) cancer stem cells (CSC) including ABCB1 and JARID1B. ABCB1 immunoreactivity was detected in a number of tumor cells in human melanomas, and in particular in clusters at the invasive front of the primary tumors. Together, our findings support that the human melanoma SP is enriched in tumorigenic and chemoresistant capacity, considered key characteristics of CSC. The melanoma SP may therefore represent an interesting therapeutic target. Four primary melanomas (subtype SSMM) were dissociated into single cells. From each of these single cell suspensions, side population (SP) and bulk \\main population\\ (MP) cells were isolated based on their Hoechst-effluxing capability using fluorescence-activated cell sorting.

In response to elevated glucocorticoid levels, erythroid progenitors rapidly expand to produce large numbers of young erythrocytes. Previous work demonstrates hematopoietic changes in rodents exposed to various physical and psychological stressors, however, the effects of chronic psychological stress on erythropoiesis has not be delineated. We employed laboratory, clinical and genomic analyses of a murine model of chronic restraint stress (RST) to examine the influence of psychological stress on erythropoiesis. Mice exposed to RST demonstrated markers of early erythroid expansion involving the glucocorticoid receptor. In addition, these RST-exposed mice had increased numbers of circulating reticulocytes and increased erythropoiesis in primary and secondary erythroid tissues. Mice also showed increases in erythroid progenitor populations and elevated expression of the erythroid transcription factor KLF1 in these cells. Together this work describes some of the first evidence of psychological stress affecting erythroid homeostasis through glucocorticoid stimulation and begins to define the transcription factor pathway involved.

Trafficking of leukocytes (dendritic cells, memory T cells, neutrophils) and tumor cells through the lymphatic network is a key process in inflammation and immunity and an important mechanism in metastatic spread of human cancers (1-3). Such trafficking involves both communication with and passage across lymphatic endothelium, the distinct endothelium that lines lymphatic vessels within the peripheral tissues and forms the lymphatic sinuses within lymph nodes. However, in comparison with blood vascular endothelium, there is only a rudimentary understanding of the molecular phenotype of lymphatic endothelium, and only a basic knowledge of the glycoconjugates that regulate leukocyte-endothelial and tumor cell-endothelial interactions in the lymphatic compartment. We would anticipate that changes in glycosylation of LEC cell surface proteins following activation might affect important functions associated withy LEC including eg. interactions with leukocytes and/or sequestration of GAG-binding chemokines. We already have shown that ligand binding to the lymphatic endothelial hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1 is reversibly masked by terminal sialation in LEC and that functional regulation of LYVE-1 is likely to be important in inflammation.

Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) have an extensive potential for clinical applications in cell therapy. However, very little is known of the specific molecular regulatory mechanisms that control the therapeutical properties of these cells. We aimed to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that could be involved in controlling the transition between the self-renewing (undifferentiated) and the reparative (differentiated) phenotypes of hMSCs. MicroRNA microarrays were used to identify miRNAs that are upregulated in undifferentiated hMSCs. For that, we compared the miRNA expression profiles of undifferentiated bone marrow-derived hMSCs with the same primary cell lines after 9 days of in vitro adipogenic or osteogenic induction. We also compared the miRNA expression profiles of undifferentiated hMSCs with skin fibroblasts (a mesenchymal cell lineage with a more restricted differentiation potential). These experiments allowed us to identify miR-335 as the only miRNA downregulated upon MSC differentiation as well as in MSCs in comparison with skin fibroblasts. Gene expression microarrays were used to identify genes that are downregulated in hMSCs overexpressing miR-335. We compared the miRNA expression profiles of hMSCs transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding miR-335 with MSCs transduced with a control lentiviral vector.

Acquired resistance to cancer drug therapies almost always occurs in advanced-stage patients even following a significant response to treatment. In addition to mutational mechanisms, various non-mutational resistance mechanisms have now been recognized. We previously described a chromatin-mediated subpopulation of reversibly drug-tolerant persisters (DTPs) that is dynamically maintained within a wide variety of tumor cell populations. Here, we explored a potential role for microRNAs in such transient drug tolerance. Functional screening of 879 human microRNAs revealed miR-371-3p as a potent suppressor of drug tolerance. PRDX6 (peroxiredoxin 6) was identified as a key target of miR-371-3p in establishing drug tolerance by regulating PLA2/PKCa activity and reactive oxygen species. PRDX6 expression is associated with poor prognosis in cancers of multiple tissue origins. These findings implicate miR-371-3p as a suppressor of PRDX6 and suggest that co-targeting of PRDX6 or modulating miR-371-3p expression together with targeted cancer therapies may delay or prevent acquired drug resistance. PC9 stable cell lines expressing GFP vector or miR-371-3p were generated to study the effect of miR-371-3p in response to erlotinib treatment for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

Monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1) and acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac) are correlated with transcriptionally engaged enhancer elements, but the functional impact of these modifications on enhancer activity is not well understood. Here we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to separate catalytic activity-dependent and independent functions of Mll3 (Kmt2c) and Mll4 (Kmt2d, Mll2), the major enhancer H3K4 monomethyltransferases. Loss of Mll3/4 catalytic activity and H3K4me1 from enhancers causes partial depletion of H3K27ac, but surprisingly minor effects on enhancer Pol II binding, enhancer RNA (eRNA) transcription and gene expression. In contrast, loss of Mll3/4 proteins results in dramatic reduction of eRNA production, concomitant with impaired transcriptional elongation at adjacent promoters. Altogether our results suggest the major coactivator function of Mll3/4 is largely independent of H3K4me1 and instead linked to enhancer Pol II occupancy, eRNA transcription and long-range influence on elongation at target promoters.

In this study, we first explored the differentially expressed genes between MLL-PTD and tMLL using gene expression profiling of our cohort (15 MLL-PTD and 10 tMLL) and one published data set. The top 250 probes were chosen from each set, resulting in 29 common probes (21 unique genes) to both sets. The selected genes include four HOXB genes, HOXB2, B3, B5, and B6. The expression values of these HOXB genes significantly differ between MLL-PTD and tMLL cases. Clustering and classification analyses were thoroughly conducted to support our gene selection results. Second, as MLL-PTD, FLT3-ITD, and NPM1 mutations are identified in AML with normal karyotypes, we briefly studied their impact on the HOXB genes.

Notch inhibition with g-secretase inhibitors demonstrated Notch activation is essential for BC differentiation into secre-tory cells and ciliated cells, but more so for the secretory lineage. Sustained Notch activation via lentivirus expression of the intracellular domain of each Notch receptor (NICD1-4) demonstrated that the Notch 2 and 4 pathways have little effect on BC differentiation, while activation of the Notch1 or 3 pathways has a major influence, with persistent expression of NICD1 or 3 resulting in a skewing toward secretory cell differentiation with a parallel decrease in ciliated cell differentiation.

Piecemeal identification of many axonogenesis-related genes has been done, but coordinated regulation is unknown. Through unbiased transcriptome profiling of immature primary cortical neurons during early axon formation, we discovered an association between axonogenesis and neuron-specific alternative splicing. Known axonogenesis genes exhibit little expression alternation but widespread splicing changes. Axonogenesis-associated splicing is governed by RNA binding protein PTBP2, which is enriched in neurons and peaks around axonogenesis in the brain. Cortical depletion of PTBP2 prematurely induces axonogenesis-associated splicing, causes imbalanced expression of axonogenesis-associated isoforms, and specifically affects axon formation in vitro and in vivo. PTBP2-controlled axongeneisis-associated Shtn1 splicing determines SHTN1's capacity to regulate actin interaction, polymerization, and axon growth. Precocious Shtn1 isoform switch contributes to disorganized axon formation of Ptbp2-/- neurons. We conclude that PTBP2-orchestrated alternative splicing programming is required for robust generation of a single axon in mammals. Immature cortical neurons were cultured from embryonic day 14 mouse neocortices at the density of 1 million cells per 35 mm petri dish. At 1 day in vitro (1 DIV), these neurons extend multiple indistinguishable processes in a seemingly random manner, just like pre-axonogenesis neurons in vivo. Around 3 DIV, one of the neurites accelerates its growth to become the axon. We performed unbiased deep RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of wildytpe DIV 1, wildtype DIV 3, and Ptbp2-/- DIV1 neurons.

    "text": "Secreted bacterial effectors that inhibit host protein synthesis are critical for induction of the innate immune response to virulent Legionella pneumophila [exp2]. The intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila causes an inflammatory pneumonia called Legionnaires' Disease. For virulence, L. pneumophila requires a Dot/Icm type IV secretion system that translocates bacterial effectors to the host cytosol. L. pneumophila lacking the Dot/Icm system is recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), leading to a canonical NF-kB-dependent transcriptional response. In addition, L. pneumophila expressing a functional Dot/Icm system potently induces unique transcriptional targets, including proinflammatory genes such as Il23a and Csf2. Here we demonstrate that this Dot/Icm-dependent response, which we term the effector-triggered response (ETR), requires five translocated bacterial effectors that inhibit host protein synthesis. Upon infection of macrophages with virulent L. pneumophila, these five effectors caused a global decrease in host translation, thereby preventing synthesis of IkB, an inhibitor of the NF-kB transcription factor. Thus, macrophages infected with wildtype L. pneumophila exhibited prolonged activation of NF-kB, which was associated with transcription of ETR target genes such as Il23a and Csf2. L. pneumophila mutants lacking the five effectors still activated TLRs and NF-kB, but because the mutants permitted normal IkB synthesis, NF-kB activation was more transient and was not sufficient to fully induce the ETR. L. pneumophila mutants expressing enzymatically inactive effectors were also unable to fully induce the ETR, whereas multiple compounds or bacterial toxins that inhibit host protein synthesis via distinct mechanisms recapitulated the ETR when administered with TLR ligands. Previous studies have demonstrated that the host response to bacterial infection is induced primarily by specific microbial molecules that activate TLRs or cytosolic pattern recognition receptors. Our results add to this model by providing a striking illustration of how the host immune response to a virulent pathogen can also be shaped by pathogen-encoded activities, such as inhibition of host protein synthesis. Three-condition experiment: macrophages left uninfected (negative control), or infected with wildtype Legionella pneumophila, or the mutant D5, which lacks five bacterial effectors involved in inhibition of host protein synthesis (lgt1, lgt2, lgt3, sidI, sidL) (two experimental conditions).

Background: mRNA interactions with each other and other signaling molecules define different biological pathways and functions. Researchers have been investigating various tools to analyze these types of interactions. In particular, gene co-expression network methods have proved useful in finding and analyzing these molecular interactions. Many different analytical pipelines to identify these interactions networks have been proposed with the aim of identifying an optimal partition of the network where the individual modules are neither too small to make any general inference or too large to be biologically interpretable. Results: In this study, we propose a new pipeline to perform gene co-expression network analysis. The proposed pipeline uses WGCNA, a widely used software to perform different aspects of gene co-expression network analysis and modularity maximization algorithm to analyze novel RNA-Seq data to understand the effects of low-dose 56Fe ion irradiation on the formation of hepatocellular carcinoma in mice. The network results along with experimental validation show that using WGCNA combined with Modularity provide a more biologically interpretable network in our dataset. Our pipeline showed better performance than the existing clustering algorithm in WGCNA in finding modules and identified a module with mitochondrial subunits that are supported by mitochondrial complex assay. Conclusions: We present a pipeline that can reduce the problem of parameter selection with the existing algorithm in WGCNA for comparable RNA-Seq datasets which may assist in future research to discover novel mRNA interactions and their downstream molecular effects. C57BL16 males were placed into 2 treatment groups and received the following irradiation treatments at Brookhaven National Laboratories (Long Island, NY): 600 MeV/n 56Fe (0.2 Gy), and no irradiation. Left liver lobes were collected at 30, 60, 120, 270, and 360 days post-irradiation, flash frozen and stored at -80degC until they could be processed for RNA-Seq. Livers were sampled by taking two 40-micron thick slices using a cryotome at -20degC. This allowed multiple sampling of the tissue without the tissue going through multiple freeze/thaw cycles. Total RNA was isolated from the liver slices using RNAqueousTM Total RNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and rRNA was removed via Ribo-ZeroTM rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) prior to library preparation with the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library kit.

We have previously reported that the deficiency of p53 alone or in combination with Rb (Rb-/- p53-/-) in adipose-derived MSCs (ASCs) promotes leiomyosarcoma-like tumors in vivo. Here, we hypothesized that the source of MSCs and/or the cell differentiation stage could determine the phenotype of sarcoma development. To investigate whether there is a link between the source of MSCs and sarcoma phenotype, we generated p53-/- and Rb-/-p53-/- MSCs from bone marrow (BM-MSCs). Both genotypes of BM-MSCs initiated leiomyosarcoma formation similar to p53-/- and Rb-/-p53-/- ASCs. In addition, gene expression profiling revealed a link between p53- or Rb-p53-deficient BM-MSCs and ASCs and muscle-associated sarcomagenesis. These data suggest that the tissue source of MSC does not seem a crucial factor in the development of a particular sarcoma phenotype. To analyze whether the differentiation stage defines the sarcoma phenotype, BM-MSCs and ASCs were induced to differentiate towards the osteogenic lineage, and both p53 and Rb were excised using Cre-expressing adenovectors at different stages along osteogenic differentiation. Regardless of the level of osteogenic commitment, the inactivation of Rb and p53 in BM-MSC-derived, but not in ASC-derived, osteogenic progenitors gave rise to osteosarcoma-like tumors which could be serially transplanted. This indicates that the osteogenic differentiation stage of BM-MSCs imposes the phenotype of in vivo sarcoma development, and that BM-MSC-derived osteogenic progenitors rather than undifferentiated BM-MSCs, undifferentiated ASCs or ASC-derived osteogenic progenitors, represent the cell of origin for osteosarcoma development. BM-MSC and ASC cultures were established from 3 mouse strains: (a) WT, (b) p53loxP/loxP and (c) p53loxP/loxP RbloxP/loxP. The corresponding mutant cells were generated by excision of the LoxP-flanked sequences by infection of all MSC cultures with adenoviral vectors expressing the Cre-recombinase gene (Ad-CMV-Cre).

We have identified a replication-independent histone variant, Hist2h2be (referred to herein as H2be), which is expressed exclusively by olfactory chemosensory neurons. Levels of H2BE are heterogeneous among olfactory neurons, but stereotyped according to the identity of the co-expressed olfactory receptor (OR). Gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that changes in H2be expression affect olfactory function and OR representation in the adult olfactory epithelium. We show that H2BE expression is reduced by sensory activity and that it promotes neuronal cell death, such that inactive olfactory neurons display higher levels of the variant and shorter life spans. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of H2BE differ from those of the canonical H2B, consistent with a role for H2BE in altering transcription. We propose a physiological function for H2be in modulating olfactory neuron population dynamics to adapt the OR repertoire to the environment.The objective of generating this dataset was to analyze the effects of the ectopic over-expression of H2be (expressed from an Omp-promoter-driven transgene and tagged with a FLAG epitope) on gene expression in the main olfactory epithelium of 5-week old mice.

The microarray results revealed altered expression of mRNAs corresponding to factors involved in protein trafficking in uterine stroma of Hif2 alpha-ablated mice. These factors mediate crosstalk between uterine storma and epithelial cells to promote epithelial remodeling and implantation. Thus, Hif2 alpha regulates embryo implantation by controlled trafficking of secretory granules during early pregnancy.

In this study, we demonstrated that the arylsulfonamide derivative MPT0G013 has potent antiangiogenic activities in vitro and in vivo via inducing TIMP3 expression. Treatments with MPT0G013 significantly inhibited endothelial cell functions, such as cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation, as well as induced p21 and cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. Subsequent microarray analysis showed significant induction of TIMP3 gene expression by MPT0G013, and siRNA-mediated blockage of TIMP3 up-regulation abrogated the antiangiogenic activities of MPT0G013 and prevented inhibition of p-AKT and p-ERK proteins. Importantly, MPT0G013 exhibited antiangiogenic activities in in vivo Matrigel plug assays, inhibited tumor growth and up-regulated TIMP3 and p21 proteins in HCT116 mouse xenograft models.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, which is comprised of chronic bronchitis and emphysema, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Because tissue destruction is the prominent characteristic of emphysema, extracellular proteinases, particularly those with elastolytic ability, are often considered to be key drivers in this disease. Several human and mouse studies have implicated roles for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly macrophage-derived proteinases, in COPD pathogenesis. MMP28 is expressed by the pulmonary epithelium and macrophage, and we have found that it regulates macrophage recruitment and polarization. We hypothesized that MMP28 would have contributory roles in emphysema via alteration of macrophage numbers and activation. Because of the established association of emphysema pathogenesis to macrophage influx, we evaluated the inflammatory changes and lung histology of Mmp28-/- mice exposed to 3 and 6 months of cigarette smoke. At earlier time-points, we found altered macrophage polarization in the smoke-exposed Mmp28-/- lung consistent with other published findings that MMP28 regulates macrophage activation. At both 3 and 6 months, Mmp28-/- mice had blunted inflammatory responses more closely resembling non-smoked mice, with a reduction in neutrophil recruitment and CXCL1 chemokine expression. By 6 months, Mmp28-/- mice were protected from emphysema. These results highlight a previously unrecognized role for MMP28 in promoting chronic lung inflammation and tissue remodeling induced by cigarette smoke and highlight another potential target to modulate COPD. Total RNA from whole lungs homogenates of wildtype and knockout (Mmp28-/-) mice exposed to room air or 3 months of cigarette smoke was isolated and hybidized to Illumina Mouse Ref-8 v2 Expression BeadChips.",

Although the antiproliferative and prodifferentiation action of active vitamin D (1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 1,25(OH)2D3) on colon carcinoma cells is well documented, its potential effects on CRC stroma are unknown. Here, we show that high vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression in tumor stromal fibroblasts is associated with better overall and progression-free survival in a large cohort of CRC patients, irrespective of its expression in carcinoma cells. Consistently, 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits the activation of patient-derived normal and cancer-associated fibroblasts, and their pro-migratory effect on carcinoma cells. Importantly, we show by global transcriptomic analyses that 1,25(OH)2D3 regulates cancer-associated fibroblast gene expression and imposes a gene signature that is associated with longer overall and disease-free survival of CRC patients. Moreover, expression of two genes from the signature, CD82 and S100A4, correlates with stromal VDR expression and clinical outcome in CRC.

Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon resulting in parent-of-origin mono-allelic expression of a small subset of mammalian genes. Imprinted genes have been categorized into two groups: multi lineage (ML) imprinted genes that can show imprinted expression in both embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages, and genes that show extra-embryonic lineage (EXEL) specific imprinted expression restricted to tissues like the placenta and visceral yolk sac (VYS) endoderm. Many genes showing EXEL imprinted expression are silenced by lncRNAs that act over long distances. Thus the analysis of this form of gene silencing is likely to be pivotal for understanding new mechanisms of long range gene silencing by lncRNAs. It has been reported that ES cells differentiated into cystic embryoid bodies (cystic EBs) contain VYS endoderm and here we investigate if cystic EBs could serve as an in vitro model for the analysis of EXEL imprinted expression. Unexpectedly we found that cystic EBs lack EXEL imprinted expression, while retaining normal imprinted expression of ML genes. This shows that cystic EBs do not model VYS imprinted expression and also argues against previous claims that cystic EBs contain VYS endoderm. We further characterized cystic EBs by performing RNA-seq and whole genome bisulphite sequencing. By comparison to various embryonic tissues we found that cystic EBs more resemble embryonic liver, which contains definitive endoderm, than the extra-embryonic endoderm of the VYS. Examination of gene and retrotranssposone expression and DNA methylation in extraembryonic, embryonic tissues and ES cell diferentiated as cystic EBs.",

Gene-expression profiles of liver tissue of cabon tetrachloride (CCl4)-treated mouse and the effect of erlotinibHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common solid tumor worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer-related death. Given the lack of successful treatment options, chemoprevention in high-risk patients has been proposed as an alternative strategy. Mounting evidence supports a role for epidermal growth factor (EGF) during chronic liver disease and hepatocellular transformation. We address the hypothesis that blocking the EGF-EGF receptor (EGFR) pathway may be an effective strategy for inhibiting fibrogenesis and hepatocarcinogenesis. A rat model of diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced cirrhosis was used to examine the effects of erlotinib on underlying chronic liver disease and HCC formation. The DEN-induced rat model closely resembles disease progression in humans both pathologically and molecularly. Erlotinib significantly prevented the development of HCC tumor nodules in a dose-dependent fashion. Further, erlotinib inhibited the activation of hepatic stellate cells and prevented fibrogenesis. Erlotinib also reduced hepatotoxicity and improved liver function. Finally, a gene expression signature predictive of poor survival in human cirrhosis patients was reversed in response to erlotinib. Our data demonstrate for the first time that EGFR inhibition prevents liver fibrogenesis. Further, our results suggest that erlotinib is a potentially effective HCC chemoprevention strategy through inhibition of cirrhosis progression which can be monitored at the molecular level.

Investigation the RNA profiling in Huh7 cells upon knock-out lncRNA HAND2-AS1 or knock-down INO80 via gene expression microarray analysisHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent liver cancer, characterized by a high rate of recurrence and heterogeneity. Liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) may well contribute to both of these pathological properties, but the mechanism underlying their self-renewal and maintenance are poorly understood. Here we identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) termed HAND2-AS1 that is highly expressed in liver CSCs. Human HAND2-AS1 is highly conserved to its mouse ortholog lncHand2. HAND2-AS1 is required for the self-renewal maintenance of liver CSCs to initiate HCC development. Mechanically, HAND2-AS1 recruits the INO80 complex onto BMPR1A promoter to trigger its expression, leading to the activation of BMP signaling. Importantly, targeting HAND2-AS1 by antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and BMPR1A by siRNAs have synergistic anti-tumor effects on humanized HCC models. Moreover, knockout of lncHand2 or Bmpr1a in mouse hepatocytes impairs BMP signaling and suppresses the initiation of liver cancer. Our findings reveal that HAND2-AS1 promotes the self-renewal of liver CSCs and drives liver oncogenesis, which may be a potential target for HCC therapy.

Transgenic mice with cardiac-restricted overexpression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) have substantially increased tolerance towards ischemia/reperfusion injury.

The purpose of this study was to determine gene expression in cardiac myocytes stimulated with purified, recombinant CTGF, comparing unstimulated and stimulated samples. The cytoprotective actions of CTGF was recflected in the transcriptome of CTGF-stimulated cardiac myocytes. Gene ontology analysis revealed that genes included under the terms anti-apoptosis, response to wounding, and response to stress were significantly overrepresented in cardiac myocytes exposed to CTGF.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are tightly regulated in the immune system, as aberrant expression of miRNAs often results in hematopoietic malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Previously, elevated levels of miR-27 in T cells isolated from multiple sclerosis patients has been suggested to facilitate disease progression through inhibiting Th2 immunity and promoting pathogenic Th1 responses. Here we demonstrate that while mice with T cell-specific overexpression of miR-27 harbor dysregulated Th1 responses and develop autoimmune pathology, these disease phenotypes are not driven by miR-27 in effector T cells in a cell-autonomous manner but rather resulted from a perturbed regulatory T (Treg) cell compartment. Excessive miR-27 expression in T cells severely impairs Treg cell differentiation. Moreover, Treg cells with exaggerated miR-27-mediated gene regulation exhibit diminished homeostasis and suppressor function in vivo. Mechanistically, miR-27 represses several known as well as previously uncharacterized targets that play critical roles in controlling multiple aspects of Treg cell biology. Collectively, our data show miR-27 functions as a key regulator in Treg cell development and function and suggest that proper regulation of miR-27 is pivotal to safeguard Treg cell-mediated immunological tolerance.

We found that HDAC4 interacts with huntingtin in a polyglutamine-length dependent manner and co-localises with cytoplasmic inclusions. We show that HDAC4 reduction delayed cytoplasmic aggregate formation, restored Bdnf transcript levels and rescued neuronal and cortico-striatal synaptic function in HD mouse models. This was accompanied by an improvement in motor co-ordination, neurological phenotypes and increased lifespan. Surprisingly, HDAC4 reduction had no effect on global transcriptional dysfunction and did not modulate nuclear huntingtin aggregation. Our results define a crucial role for cytoplasmic aggregation in the molecular pathology of HD.

Objective: The cancer stem cell (CSC) paradigm hypothesizes that successful clinical eradication of CSCs may lead to durable remission for patients with ovarian cancer. Despite mounting evidence in support of ovarian CSCs, their phenotype and clinical relevance remain unclear. We and others have found high aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDHhigh) expression in a variety of normal and malignant stem cells, and sought to better characterize ALDHhigh cells in ovarian cancer.Methods: We compared ALDHhigh to ALDHlow cells in two ovarian cancer models representing distinct subtypes: FNAR-C1 cells, derived from a spontaneous rat endometrioid carcinoma, and the human SKOV3 cell line (described as both serous and clear cell subtypes). We assessed these populations for stem cell features then analyzed expression by microarray and qPCR.Results: ALDHhigh cells displayed CSC properties, including: smaller size, quiescence, regenerating the phenotypic diversity of the cell lines in vitro, lack of contact inhibition, nonadherent growth, multi-drug resistance, and in vivo tumorigenicity. Microarray and qPCR analysis of the expression of markers reported by others to enrich for ovarian CSCs revealed that ALDHhigh cells of both models showed downregulation of CD24, but inconsistent expression of CD44, KIT and CD133. However, the following drugable targets were consistently expressed in the ALDHhigh cells from both models: mTOR signaling, her-2/neu, CD47 and FGF18 / FGFR3.Conclusions: Based on functional characterization, ALDHhigh ovarian cancer cells represent an ovarian CSC population. Differential gene expression identified drugable targets that have the potential for therapeutic efficacy against ovarian CSCs from multiple subtypes. FNAR-C1 rat ovarian cancer cells were sorted into Aldefluor high and Aldefluor low populations. Analysis was performed in triplicate. Aldefluor low cells served as the reference cells for fold-change analysis.",

However, mechanisms that propagate regional identity from VZ progenitors to cortical plate (CP) neurons are unknown. Here we show that the VZ, subventricular zone (SVZ), and CP contain distinct molecular maps of regional identity, reflecting different gene expression gradients in radial glia progenitors, intermediate progenitors, and projection neurons, respectively. The intermediate map in SVZ is modulated by Eomes (also known as Tbr2), a T-box TF. Eomes inactivation caused rostrocaudal shifts in SVZ and CP gene expression, with loss of corticospinal axons and gain of corticotectal projections.

In order to investigate the role of IRAK-4 kinase function in vivo, 'knock-in' mice were generated by replacing the wild type IRAK-4 gene with a mutant gene encoding kinase deficient IRAK-4 protein (IRAK-4 KD). Analysis of bone marrow macrophages obtained from WT and IRAK-4 KD mice with a number of experimental techniques demonstrated that the IRAK-4 KD cells greatly lack responsiveness to stimulation with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist LPS. One of the techniques used, microarray analysis, identified IRAK-4 kinase-dependent LPS response genes and revealed that the induction of LPS-responsive mRNAs was largely ablated in IRAK-4 KD cells. In summary, our results suggest that IRAK-4 kinase activity plays a critical role in TLR4-mediated induction of inflammatory responses.Keywords: genetic modification, strain comparison, cell stimulation, time course, anti-bacterial response, innate immune response, inflammatory response.

Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an essential evolutionarily conserved molecular chaperone in eukaryotes. Cancer cells rely on Hsp90 to chaperone activated oncoproteins, and its involvement in numerous signaling pathways makes it an attractive target for drug development. Surprisingly, however, the impact of Hsp90 inhibitors on cancer cells is most commonly cytostatic, and efforts to enhance the anti-tumor activity of Hsp90 inhibitors in the clinic remain a significant challenge. In this study, we show that dual inhibition of Wee1 tyrosine kinase and Hsp90 causes prostate cancer cells to undergo apoptosis. Gene-expression profiling revealed that induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by this drug combination coincided with transcriptional down-regulation of Survivin and Wee1, an outcome not seen in cells treated separately with either agent. At the translational level, expression of these two proteins as well as activated Akt was completely abrogated. Similar results were obtained in prostate cancer xenografts. These data establish a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of Hsp90 inhibitors in prostate cancer, and they provide a mechanistic rationale for stimulating the pro-apoptotic activity of Hsp90 inhibitors.In order to explore the mechanism underlying the enhanced cell death caused by Wee1 inhibitorII and 17-AAG combination, we performed microarray analysis using PC3 cells treated with Wee1 inhibitorII alone, 17-AAG alone, or the two drugs in combination.

He had no exostosis or bony deformity. He had difficulty in getting up from squatting position and needed a stick to help with walking. The hip joint movements were painful and restricted.. The rest of the examination including abdomen was other wise normal or non-contributory. His laboratory evaluation was as follows: hemoglobin 13.2gm/dl, total WBC 7200/mm3 and erythrocyte sedimentation rate12 mm for 1st hour. Mean +- SD (3 values) serum calcium (Ca) adjusted for albumin was 9.5 +- 1.3 mg/dl (reference range: 8.5 - 11mg/dl). Serum phosphate (PO4) was 3.5 +- 0.3 mg/dl (reference range 3.5-5.0 mg/dl), serum magnesium 1.6mg/dl (reference range 1.58-2.55 mg/dl), total alkaline phosphatase (AP) 39.6 +- 2.6 KA Units (reference range: 3 - 13 KA Units), serum creatinine (Cr) was 1.1 mg/dl. Liver function tests were normal. Twenty four hour mean urine Ca, and phosphorus was 65.3 and 563 mg/d, respectively. The renal tubular handling of phosphate was normal (TmP/GFR 4.2 mg/dl - normal 2.4-4.2). The serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level by immunochemilunometry was 19 pg/ml (reference range: 10-69 pg/ml).Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was 59.9( reference range 9 - 37 ng/ml). Serum 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D level was 76.6 ng/ml (reference range - 3 ng/ml). Arterial blood gases and urine pH were within normal range. Thyroid function tests were normal. Serum tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG) titre was negative. Urine for Bence Jones protein was negative and serum electrophoresis was normal. Radiographs of the skull and hands were normal. The lumbar spine showed \"rugger -jersey\" spine with osteopenia . Views of the pelvis showed bilateral coxa vera and bilateral femur neck fracture with \"fishnet appearance\". The chest radiograph showed multiple Looser zones with fractures of several ribs. The lower end of tibia showed \"fishnet appearance\", tendon calcification and new bone formation. Ultrasonography of the neck did not reveal any abnormality in the thyroid or parathyroid glands. Ultrasonography of the abdomen and KUB region was normal. A 99mTc sestamibi scan was normal. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the hip with a T-score of -2.2 SD. Magnetic resonance imaging of pelvis showed fracture of bilateral neck and hypointense marrow on T1W and T2W sequences . A 99mTc MDP bone scan showed increased radiotracer uptake bilaterally in the shoulders, elbows, wrists, small joints of hands, multiple sites at bilateral ribs, the entire vertebral column, and lower end of tibia but not the skull (beheaed scan). Transiliac bone biopsy showed thickened bony trabeculae with obliteration of marrow spaces and at places, focal areas of exaggerated osteoclastic activity. There was prominent osteoblastic proliferation as well as osteoid like areas were also seen. At places it showed sclerosis, eaten up edges of bone and foci of new calcification (bone formation). With the above mentioned clinical and investigation proile a diagnosis of FIO was considered most likelyFIO may easily be misdiagnosed because of its superficial similarity to axial osteomalacia osteoporosis, and other metabolic bone disorders with pathological fractures. Bone pain or pathological fractures in a previously healthy adult should lead to radiological and biochemical investigation. Generalized increase in radiological bone density may indicate myelofibrosis or fluorosis but an increased level of alkaline phosphatase favours Paget's disease or osteomalacia. Bone biopsy suggests gross osteomalacia until the nostic process is rarely logical, but it would not be so delayed if bone sections were always examined under polarized light. There are many unsolved problems in this crippling condition. Apart from complete ignorance of the cause, yet it is not known, what is replacing the mature collagen of bone, why other collagen-containing tissues are apparently unaffected. Why patients commonly have circulating paraprotein and whether there is any effective treatment. Till date, there is no literature has been reported exploring the genes involved in the pathogenesis of FIO. Hence, aim of present study is identification of various genes involved in the regulation of various signaling pathways involved in pathogenesis of FIO. Total RNA was isolated from Trans-Iliac Bone biopsy (Control Individual (n=1) & Patient (n=1)) using TRIZOL method and global microarray was performed on Affymetrix Genechip HumanPrimview platform. The array was performed on duplicate.",

Human multipotent stromal cells readily form single-cell-derived colonies when plated at clonal densities. However, the colonies are heterogeneous because cells from a colony form new colonies that vary in size and differentiation potential when replated at clonal densities. The experiments here tested the hypothesis that cells in the inner regions of colonies are partially differentiated, but the differentiation is reversible. Cells were separately isolated from the dense inner (IN) regions and less-dense outer regions (OUT) of single-cell-derived colonies. Cells were then compared by assays of their transcriptomes and proteins, and for clonogenicity and differentiation. IN cells expressed fewer cell-cycle genes and higher levels of genes for extracellular matrix than the OUT cells. When transferred to differentiation medium, differentiation of the colonies occurred primarily in the IN regions. However, the IN cells were indistinguishable from OUT cells when replated at clonal densities and assayed for rates of propagation and clonogenicity. Also, colonies formed by IN cells were similar to colonies formed by OUT cells because they had distinct IN and OUT regions. Cultures of IN and OUT cells remained indistinguishable through multiple passages (30-75 population doublings), and both cells formed colonies that were looser and less dense as they were expanded. The results demonstrated that cells in the IN region of single-cell-derived colonies are partially differentiated, but the differentiation can be reversed by replating the cells at clonal densities. In this study heterogeneity of human multipotent stromal cells in single-cell-derived colonies was examined. Cells were grown as colonies on slides for 12 days and cells from inside (IN) and outside (OUT) of colonies were isolated with laser capture microdissection. Cells from two colonies were pooled for each sample. This study consists of 3 biological replicates for each colony region (3 for IN and 3 for OUT). All 6 samples were run on Affymetrix microarrays after amplification and labeling using Nugen Ovation technology.",

Despite large efforts there is still uncertainty concerning the molecular pathogenesis of these deaths. With genetic technology in constant development the possibility of an alternative approach into this research field have become available, like mRNA expression studies. Methods: In this study we investigated mRNA gene expression in 14 cases that died suddenly and unexpectedly from infection without a history of severe illness prior to death. The control group included eight accidents, two cases of natural death, one undetermined, one case of medical malpractice and two homicides. The study included tissue from liver, heart and brain. The mRNA expression was determined using Illumina whole genome gene expression DASL HT assay. Results: From the array, 19 genes showed altered expression in the infectious deaths compared to controls. The heart was the organ were most genes showed altered expression: 15 genes showed different mRNA expression compared to the control group. Conclusion: Down-regulation of KCNE5 in heart tissue from cases of infectious death was of particular interest. Variants of KCNE5 are associated with Brugada syndrome KCNE5 gene is known to give increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death, and could be responsible for the fatal outcome in the group of infectious death. The purpose of this study was to investigate gene expression in infection cases and controls, in order to uncover genes that are differentially expressed in the two groups. Tissue from brain, heart and liver from 10 infection cases and 10 controls were included in this study, and mRNA expression was determined using the Illumina whole genome gene expression DASL HT assay.

    "text": "Effect of monocyte- and osteoclast-derived extracellular vesicles on adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells. Intercellular communication is essential in bone remodelling to ensure that new bone is formed with only temporary bone loss. Monocytes and osteoclasts actively take part in controlling bone remodelling by providing signals that promote osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have attracted attention as regulators of bone remodelling. EVs facilitate intercellular communication by transferring a complex cargo of biologically active molecules to target cells. In the present study, we evaluated the potency of EVs from monocytes and osteoclasts to induce a lineage-specific response in MSCs. We analysed gene expression and protein secretion by both adipose tissue-derived MSCs and bone marrow-derived MSCs after stimulation with EVs from lipopolysaccharide-activated primary human monocytes and (mineral-resorbing) osteoclasts. Isolated EVs were enriched in exosomes (EVs of endosomal origin) and were free of cell debris. Monocyte- and osteoclast-derived EVs were taken up by adipose tissue-derived MSCs. EVs from activated monocytespromoted the secretion of cytokines by MSCs, which may represent an immunomodulatory mechanism. Monocyte-derived EVs also upregulated the expression of genes encoding for matrix metalloproteinases. Therefore, we hypothesize that monocytes facilitate tissue remodelling through EV-mediated signalling. We did not observe a significant effect of osteoclast-derived EVs on gene expression or protein secretion in MSCs. EV-mediated signalling might represent an additional mode of cell-cell signalling during the transition from injury and inflammation to bone regeneration and play an important role in the coupling between bone resorption and bone formation.

    "text": "Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is instructed by promoter sequence and refined by developmental progression [expression]. A large body of literature suggests that local features of chromatin are crucial in determining functional properties of underlying DNA. The extent to which DNA sequence plays an active role in the establishment and maintenance of patterns of histone and DNA modification at promoters in cells and tissues in an adult animal remains poorly understood. Likewise, whether passage through development is required for refinement of transcriptional states and chromatin marks characteristic of fully differentiated adult cells remains unclear. Here we undertook analysis of gene expression along with the genomic distribution of DNA methylation and a set of histone marks in primary tissues derived from different primordial germ layers in adult mice. We find that promoter CpG content correlated strongly with specific repressive mechanisms. Likewise, RNA polymerase II occupancy and active histone marks were omnipresent on CpG rich promoters regardless of transcriptional output and of cell type. However, these same chromatin features cleanly demarcate transcriptional activity on promoters with low CpG content. While these observations imply an instructive role for DNA sequence in establishment and maintenance of epigenetic states, experimental evidence presented here also suggests an additional role for development in refining these features at individual promoters.

Objective: to compare changes in gene expression by microarray from subcutaneous adipose tissue from HIV treatment naive patients treated with efavirenz based regimens containing abacavir (ABC), tenofavir (TDF) or zidovidine (AZT). There were significant divergence between ABC and the other two groups 6 months after treatment in genes controlling cell adhesion and environmental information processin, with some convergence at 18 months. Compared to HIV negative controls the ABC group, but not AZT or TDF, showed enrichment of genes controlling adherence junction at six months and 184 months (adjusted p <0.05), and cell matrix adhesion (adjusted p<3.4E-0.5) at 6 months. Tight junction (p=0.03), gap junction (p<0.05) and leukocyte transendothelial migration (p=0.03) were over-expressed in ABC compared to TDF at 6 m. Enrichment pathways and individual genes controlling cell adhesion and environmental information processing were specifically dysregulated in the ABC group compared with the other treatments, There was little difference between AZT and TDF.Conclusion: After initiating treatment, there is divergence in the expression of genes controlling cell adhesion and environmental information processing between ABC and both TDF and AZT in subcutaneous adipose tissue. If similar changes are taking place in other tissues including the coronary vasculature, they may contribute to the observed increased risk of cardiovascular events reported in patients recently started on abacavir-containing regimens. 31 HIV treatment naive patients were randomised to receive either zidovidine (AZT)/lamivudine or tenofavir (TDF)/emtricitabine in fixed dose preparations. Both groups also received efavirenz. Patients were tested before treatment (AZT n=15, TDF n=16) and at 6 (AZT n=9, TDF n=12) and 18-24 (AZT n= 8, TDF n=9) months after starting therapy. Tests included extensive biochemical tests, tests of body fat distribution and subcutaneous fat biopsies. 15 HIV negative patients were similarly tested. Patients and controls were matched for age, ethnicity, gender, weight, BMI, pretreatment CD4 count, viral load, and family history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. In a second part of the study patients on their initial antiretroviral regimen containihg abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine plus efavirenz for 6 months (n=9) and 184 months (n=10) were similarly tested. the ABC-treated group were matched in all the listed characteristice with the other two groups. None of the patients had ever experienced an AIDS-defining disease or developed lipodystrophy over the study period. Fat biopsies were snap frozen until assayed. Microarray methods: RNA was extracted for microarray and array data generated using a Qiagen RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit. Total RNA was converted into labeled cDNA using the WT-Ovation Pico RNA Amplification System and samples were hybridized to an Agilent Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K (AMADID 014850, Agilent Technologies). The Agilent arrays were scanned with the Agilent Technologies DNA Microarray Scanner G2505C with default settings. Scanned images were extracted and initial quality control performed in Agilent Feature Extraction (AFE) software version 10.7.3.1. Additional quality assessment was performed using the R arrayQualityMetrics package. As no major experimental problems could be detected, all microarrays were included in subsequent analysis steps. The dataset was read into R and processed using the Agi4x44PreProcess package with options to use the AFE Processed Signal as foreground signal and BG Used signal as background adjusted signal. The data were then normalized by the quantile method using the limma function normalize Between Arrays. Probeset filtering was performed using the Agi4x44PreProcess filter method using AFE provided flags to identify features with quantification errors of the signal, reducing the 45,015 features on the Agilent Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K array by 38%, or 17,264 features. Residual technical batch effects were corrected using the ComBat method implemented in the SVA R package.Since patients were not randomised to the ABC treatment all samples were treated as unrelated. Gene expression differences between treatment arms were assessed using the linear modeling features implemented in the limma package in R. Multiple testing across contrasts was performed using the limma global method with Benjamini-Hochberg approach for control of false discovery rate (FDR).

We sought to identify signaling pathways that play protective or pathogenic roles in experimental Schistosoma-induced pulmonary vascular disease by whole-lung transcriptome analysis. Methods: Wildtype mice were experimentally exposed to S. mansoni ova by intraperitoneal sensitization followed by tail vein augmentation, and the phenotype assessed by right ventricular catheterization and tissue histology, RNA and protein analysis. Whole-lung transcriptome analysis by microarray and RNA sequencing was performed, the latter analyzed using 2 bioinformatic methods. Functional testing of the candidate IL-6 pathway was determined using IL6-knockout mice and the STAT3 inhibitor STI-201. Results: Wild-type mice exposed to S. mansoni had increased right ventricular systolic pressure and thickness of the pulmonary vascular media. Whole lung transcriptome analysis identified the IL6-STAT3-NFATc2 pathway as being upregulated, which was confirmed by PCR and immunostaining of lung tissue from S. mansoni-exposed mice and patients who died of the disease. Mice lacking IL6 or treated with STI-201 developed pulmonary hypertension associated with significant intima remodeling after exposure to S. mansoni.

Many ciliopathy manifestations can be linked to deficient cilia function, yet it is unclear how a cilium defect results in nephronophthisis (NPHP), the most prevalent renal manifestation in children, characterized by inflammation, interstitial fibrosis, and renal cysts3. Here, we report that deletion of the serine threonine kinase Lkb1 in the mouse kidney results in cardinal features of nephronophthisis.

Lkb1 genetically interacts with Nphp1 in zebrafish. Unbiased transcriptional analysis in-vitro and in-vivo revealed that the chemokine CCL2 is upregulated in Lkb1 deficiency and is accompanied by recruitment of CCR2 expressing mononuclear cells in the kidney. CCL2 regulation requires NPHP1, ANKS3 and NEK7. These findings link LKB1 and ciliopathy proteins to immune regulation and explain how mutations in NPHP proteins result in fibrosis of the kidney.

Although epithelial mesenchymal transition-inducing transcription factors (EMT-TF) are known to impart the CSCs properties to some of solid tumors, it has not been clearly reported in pancreatic cancer yet. Zinc finger protein SNAI2, a member of the Snail superfamily of EMT-TF, is frequently overexpressed in pancreatic cancer cells and the poor prognosis has been reported in cases with high SNAI2 expression. we found the suppression of SNAI2 expression using RNA interference decreased the tumorigenicity in vitro (sphere formation assay) as well as in vivo (xenograft assay) in the pancreatic cancer cell line KLM1. Furthermore, microarray analysis suggests that the mechanism is mediated by insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2). These results indicate that SNAI2 may be a critical factor for the CSCs properties and indispensable for the homeostasis of pancreatic CSCs.

However, the physiology of CD21-/lo B cells remains poorly characterized. We found that some rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients also display an increased frequency of CD21-/lo B cells in their blood. A majority of CD21-/lo B cells from RA and CVID patients expressed germline autoreactive antibodies, which recognized nuclear and cytoplasmic structures. In addition, these B cells were unable to induce calcium flux, become activated, or proliferate in response to B-cell receptor and/or CD40 triggering, suggesting that these autoreactive B cells may be anergic. Moreover, gene array analyses of CD21-/lo B cells revealed molecules specifically expressed in these B cells and that are likely to induce their unresponsive stage. Thus, CD21-/lo B cells contain mostly autoreactive unresponsive clones, which express a specific set of molecules that may represent new biomarkers to identify anergic B cells in humans. RNA was extracted from batch sorted CD19+CD21+CD10-CD27- and CD19+CD21-CD10-CD27- naive B cells isolated from donors using the Absolutely RNA microprep kit (Stratagene). 100-200 ng of RNA was obtained per sample, and the quality of the purified RNA was assessed by the Bioanalyzer from Agilent. Using the Ovation biotin system kit from Nugen, 30-50ng of RNA was amplified and labeled to produce cDNA. Labeled cDNA was hybridized on chips containing the whole human genome (Human Genome U133 2.0 from Affymetrix). Data from CD21+ and CD21- B cell populations were compared in order to determine the gene signature of the newly described CD21- B cells.",

The bisecting GlcNAc on N-glycans inhibits ricin binding and enhances E-PHA binding. It is expected that mammalian CBP's, including galectins, may have their binding affected positively or negatively by the presence of the bisecting GlcNAc. In fact unpublished experiments have identified reduced binding of at least one galectin to LEC10 CHO cells that express GlcNAc-TIII compared to CHO cells that do not. We have shown that the Mgat3 gene that encodes GlcNAc-TIII, the glycosyltransferase that adds the bisecting GlcNAc, is barely expressed in E9.5 mouse embryos and robustly expressed in E10.5 embryos (J.

Methods:Genome-wide gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines was determined using microarrays derived from five discordant and four concordant MZ twin pairs with idiopathic absence epilepsies and five unaffected MZ twin pairs. Gene expression was analysed using three strategies: discordant MZ twins were compared as matched pairs, MZ twins concordant for epilepsy were compared to control MZ twins, and a singleton design of affected versus unaffected MZ twin individuals was used irrespective of twin pairing. An overlapping gene list was generated from these analyses. Dysregulation of genes recognised from the microarray experiment were validated using quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) in the twin sample and in an independent sample of 18 sporadic absence cases and 24 healthy controls.Results:Sixty-five probe sets were identified from the microarray analysis strategies. Sixteen genes were chosen for validation and nine of these genes confirmed by qRT-PCR in the twin sample. Differential expression of the immediate early gene EGR1 and RCN2, coding for the calcium-binding protein Reticulocalbin 2, was re-confirmed by qRT-PCR in the independent sample.Interpretation:Using a unique sample of discordant MZ twins, our study identified genes with altered expression, which suggest novel mechanisms in idiopathic absence epilepsy.

Transcriptional profiling revealed that multiple stem cell maintenance factors are perturbed in Pbx1-deficient LT-HSCs, which prematurely express a large subset of genes, including cell cycle regulators, normally expressed in non-self-renewing multipotent progenitors. A significant proportion of Pbx1-dependent genes are associated with the Tgf-b pathway, which serves a major role in maintaining HSC quiescence.

The hepatic endoplasmic reticulum contains a series of enzymes that oxidize and conjugate lipid and steroids. Together, these enzymes form a molecular machine that plays key roles in the metabolism of both endogenous and xenobiotic compounds. To characterize this molecular machine, we used quantitative proteomics to assess the frequency of occurrence of detected peptides within each primary sequence, leading to the assessment of the relative abundances of 137 of these proteins. These 137 proteins include over 38 different cytochrome P450s, 11 glucuronosyltransferases, and 9 carboxylesterases. Our sensitive approach was able to detect P450 allelic isoforms which differ by only a single amino acid and clearly resolved 4 splice variants of the glucuronosyltransferases. We identified a cytosolically-exposed DID motif for 3 cytochrome P450s that were located with high abundance in the Golgi apparatus as well the lack of a C-terminal HXEL motif for the sole carboxylesterase highly abundant in the Golgi.

Muscle stem cells, also known as satellite cells, are largely non-proliferative in uninjured skeletal muscle but transition at sites of injury into rapidly dividing progenitors that mediate muscle repair. As early events in satellite cell activation are rate-limiting for recovery from muscle damage, there is substantial interest in discovering their molecular driver(s). Using a comparative transcriptomic approach, we identified a prominent Fos signature in recently activated muscle satellite cells, which was rapidly and transiently induced by muscle damage. Functional interrogation using complementary genetic mouse models revealed that FOS is required for efficiently initiating key stem cell functions, including cell cycle entry, stem/progenitor cell expansion, and regeneration of muscle after injury. Transcriptional profiling further revealed that FOS activates critical gene circuits that stimulate cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation while simultaneously repressing quiescence-promoting gene signatures. Pharmacological and genetic disruption of one of these FOS-activated target genes, mono-ADP Ribosyl-Transferase 1 (Art1), in freshly isolated satellite cells substantially diminished cell cycle entry and expansion of the pool of regenerative stem cells. Together, these data implicate FOS as a crucial inducer of early-acting, pro-regenerative gene targets and highlight new transcriptional and post-translational modification events necessary for optimal injury-activated muscle stem cell regenerative responses.

Absence of genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with GKD indicate the involvement of modifier genes, including other network partners. To understand the molecular pathogenesis of GKD, we performed microarray analysis on liver mRNA from neonatal glycerol kinase (Gyk) knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) mice. Unsupervised learning revealed the overall gene expression profile of the KO mice was different from that of WT. Real time PCR confirmed differences for selected genes. Functional gene enrichment analysis was used to find 56 increased and 37 decreased gene functional categories. Pathway Assist analysis identified changes in gene expression levels of genes involved in organic acid metabolism indicating that GK was part of the same metabolic network which correlates well with the patients with GKD having metabolic acidemia during their episodic crises. Network component analysis (NCA) showed that transcription factors SREBP-1c, ChREBP, HNF-4alpha, and PPAR-alpha, had increased activity in the Gyk KO mice compared with WT mice; while SREBP-2 was less active in the Gyk KO mice.

Here we describe the accumulation of prions and associated pathology in the rat and describe the transcriptional impact throughout prion disease. Comparative transcriptional profiling between laboratory mice and rats suggests that similar molecular processes are unfolding in response to prion infection. At the level of individual transcripts, however, variability exists between mice and rats and many genes deregulated in mouse scrapie are not affected in rats. Notwithstanding these differences, many transcriptome responses are conserved between mice and rats infected with scrapie.

Based on CX3CR1 and CD62L expression levels four distinct memory T cell populations can be distinguished based on their functional properties.

Hyperassembly mediated by these prion-like domains causes several neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report a subset of the mammalian prion protein (PrP), also prone to self-assembly, propagation and to cause devastating diseases, is a component of naturally occurring messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) in adult mouse brains. Biomolecules co-purified with PrP revealed a multitude of diverse RNA granule associated proteins and mRNAs encoding members of the translation machinery, indicating a role in a specialized translation process. Importantly, PrP mutations linked to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) or fatal familial insomnia (FFI) severely impaired recovery of mRNPs from preclinical mice, possibly representing a very early pathological process. Thus, mutant PrP may cause dysfunction in RNA regulation, thereby joining the constantly expanding ranks of disease associated RNP granule proteins.The file Enrichment_analysis.xlsx contains mRNAs (FDR < 0.01) co-purified with PrP in both WT sample pools as identified by DESeq2 and the respective gene counts and log2 fold changes for CJD and FFI PrP:IP sample pools.

Several studies indicate that adult stem cells may improve the recovery from acute tissue injury. It has been suggested that they may contribute to tissue regeneration by the release of paracrine factors promoting proliferation of tissue resident cells. However, the factors involved remain unknown. In the present study we found that microvesicles (MV) derived from human liver stem cells (HLSC) were able to stimulate in vitro proliferation and apoptosis resistance of human and rat hepatocytes. These effects required internalization of MV in the hepatocytes by an alpha4 integrin-dependent mechanism. However, when treated with RNase, MV despites their internalization were unable to induce hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis resistance, suggesting an RNA dependent effect. Microarray analysis and quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that MV were shuttling a specific subset of cellular mRNA, such as mRNA associated in the control of transcription, translation, proliferation and apoptosis. When administered in vivo, MV were found to accelerate the morphological and functional recovery of liver in a model of 70% hepatectomy in rats by inducing an hepatocytes proliferation that was abolished by RNase treatment. Using human AGO2 gene, which is shuttled by MV, as a reporter gene, we found the expression of human AGO2 mRNA and protein in the liver of hepatectomized rats treated with MV. This suggest a translation of the MV shuttled mRNA within hepatocytes of treated rats. Conclusion: these results suggest that MV derived from HLSC may activate a proliferative program in remnant hepatocytes after hepatectomy by a horizontal transfer of specific mRNA subsets. MV contained mRNA was submitted to microarray analysis not to define the amount of mRNA but only to define which transcripts were present. Total RNA was prepared from two independent preparation of vesicles. 250, 500 and 1000 ngs from each preparation were transformed in biotin-labeled cRNA.

The perinatal period is a critical window for the distribution of innate tissue-resident immune cells to developing organs. Despite epidemiologic evidence implicating early life environment in risk for allergy, temporally controlled lineage-tracing of ILC2s during this period has not been done. Using complementary fate-mapping approaches and fluorescent reporters of ILC2 activation, we demonstrate that ILC2s appear in multiple organs during late gestation similar to tissue macrophages, but unlike the latter, a majority of peripheral ILC2 pools are generated de novo during a postnatal window. This period was accompanied by systemic ILC2 priming and acquisition of tissue-specific expression profiles. Although perinatal ILC2s are variably replaced with age, the dramatic increases in tissue ILC2s following helminth infection are mediated through local expansion independent of de novo generation by BM hematopoiesis. We provide the first comprehensive temporally controlled fate-mapping of an innate lymphocyte subset with notable nuances as compared to tissue macrophage ontogeny. single-cell mRNA profiles of ILC2s sorted from neonatal (14-day-old) mouse lung and skin tissues.",

Low Birth Weight (LBW) newborns (with weight less than 2500g) suffer a higher frequency and severity of microbial infection than normal birth weight (NBW) newborns. Morbidity and mortality of LBW infants due to infectious diseases are known to be high and it has been associated with compromised immune functions, however, the complete understanding of the cause is lacking. We, therefore, conducted a gene expression study to identify all the defective pathways and functions in the LBW newborns using DNA microarray. RNA were isolated from the umbilical cord blood of the NBW and LBW newborns and processed for chip hybridisation. Our results suggest down-regulation of genes participating in several canonical pathways vital in the defense response against microbes and perpetuation of immune responses. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and Interferon signaling appear to be most significantly impacted pathways. The information generated from this study may help in depth understanding of the cause of higher frequency of infections in LBW and thus, in turn help devise better therapeutic interventions.

Objectives and goals: The causes and molecular pathology of ovarian cancer are essentially unknown. However, it is generally understood that serous ovarian borderline tumors (SBOT) and well differentiated (WD) serous ovarian carcinomas (SC) have a similar tumorigenetic pathway, distinct from moderately (MD) and poorly differentiated (PD) SC. The aim of this study was to identify mRNAs differentially expressed between MD/PD SC, SBOT and superficial scrapings from normal ovaries (SNO),and to correlate these mRNAs with clinical parameters.Results: From the global gene expression analyses, thirty mRNAs differentially expressed between MD/PD SC, SBOT and SNO were selected and validated by RT-qPCR, verifying 21 mRNAs to be significantly differentially expressed (p<0.01). Of these, 13 mRNAs were differentially expressed in MD/PD SC compared with SNO (p<0.01) and were correlated with clinical parameters. VEGFA was significantly upregulated (FC=6.1, p=6.0x10-6), and correlated with progression-free survival (p=0.037). ZNF385B was significantly downregulated (FC=-130.5, p=1.2x10-7), and correlated with overall survival (p=0.03). An increased TPX2 (p=0.03) and FOXM1 (p=0.044) expression correlated with optimal normalization of serum CA125 after treatment. Furthermore, we present a common molecular pathway for MD/PD SC, including VEGFA, FOXM1, TPX2, BIRC5 and TOP2A, all significantly upregulated and interacting with TP53.Conclusions: We have identified 21 mRNAs differentially expressed (p<0.01) between MD/PD SC, SBOT and SNO. Thirteen were differentially expressed in MD/PD SC, including VEGFA and ZNF385B, correlating with survival, and FOXM1 and TPX2, correlating with normalization of serum CA125. By the use of oligonucleotid microarrays (Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays) differences in mRNA expression between eleven MD/PD SC, eight SBOT and four SNO samples were analyzed. Differentially expressed mRNAs were selected for validation by RT-qPCR in additional samples totaling 21 MD/PD SC, 13 SBOT and seven samples of SNO. Each mRNA was run in quadruple.

Currently, the molecular determinants predicting recurrence and malignant transformation are lacking. We performed global genetic and genomic analysis of 85 meningioma samples of various grades.Copy number alterations were assessed by 100K SNP arrays and correlated with gene expression, proliferation indices, and clinical outcome. In addition to chromosome 22q loss, which was detected in the majority of clinical samples, chromosome 18q and 6q loss significantly predicted recurrence and was associated with anaplastic histology. Five classes of meningiomas were detected by gene expression analysis that correlated with copy number alterations, recurrence risk, and malignant histology. These classes more accurately predicted tumor recurrence than Ki-67 index, the gold standard for determining risk of recurrence, and highlight substantial expression heterogeneity between meningiomas.

The colon-26 mouse model of cancer cachexia mimics recent late stage clinical failures of anabolic anti-cachexia therapy, and was unresponsive to anabolic doses of diverse androgens, including the selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) GTx-024. The histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) AR-42 exhibited anti-cachectic activity in this model. We explored combined SARM/AR-42 therapy as an improved anti-cachectic treatment paradigm. A reduced dose of AR-42 provided limited anti-cachectic benefits, but, in combination with GTx-024, significantly improved body weight, hind limb muscle mass, and grip strength versus controls. AR-42 suppressed the IL-6/GP130/STAT3 signaling axis in muscle without impacting circulating cytokines. GTx-024-mediated b-catenin target gene regulation was apparent in cachectic mice only when combined with AR-42. Our data suggest cachectic signaling in this model involves catabolic signaling insensitive to anabolic GTx-024 therapy and a blockade of GTx-024-mediated anabolic signaling. AR-42 mitigates catabolic gene activation and restores anabolic responsiveness to GTx-024. Combining GTx-024, a clinically established anabolic therapy, with AR-42, a clinically evaluated HDACi, represents a promising approach to improve anabolic response in cachectic patients. 31 Samples.",

Obesity is a chronic organismal stress that disrupts multiple systemic and tissue-specific functions. Here, we describe the effects of established obesity on the activity of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment. We show that obesity promotes the selection of a quiescent HSC subset primed for activation, leading to aberrant hematopoietic stress responses. We establish that the transcription factor Gfi1 is a key regulator of the HSC fate in obesity as its increased expression in obesity induces their abnormal activity. We demonstrate that these dysregulations are initially triggered by the chronic oxidative stress associated with obesity. Once acquired, we show that the impact of obesity on HSCs is long lasting and cannot be reversed by weight loss or transplantation. These results demonstrated that obesity promotes irreversible changes on the long-term fitness of the HSC compartment, a phenomenon that is likely to contribute to the hematopoietic dysregulations observed in obese patients.

Data suggests that intrauterine exposure of fetuses (exposure of the mother to air pollution during pregnancy) in fact exerts a negative impact on lung development. However, the means by which exposure during pregnancy affects lung development, have not been studied in depth yet. In this study, we investigated alterations of the transcriptome of the developing lung in a mouse model of gestational and early-life postnatal exposure to urban PM2.5 (from Sao Paulo, Brazil). Pregnant BALB/c mouse dams were randomly assigned to two study groups: one group exposed to a PM2.5 dose equivalent to 600ug/m3 for 1h daily (exposed group), the other group kept in filtered air during the whole study period (control group).

TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions that are frequently identified in prostate cancer can be generated either through chromosomal translocation or via interstitial deletion. The latter mechanism deletes an interstitial region of ~3Mb and it remains largely unanswered whether genes deleted within this region contribute to prostate cancer. By characterizing two knockin mouse models recapitulating TMPRSS2-ERG fusions with or without the interstitial deletion, we found that only those with deletion developed poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, when under a Pten-null background. We identified several interstitial genes, including ETS2 and BACE2, whose reduced expression correlates with worse disease-free survival and lethal disease. By using an Ets2 conditional knockout allele, we demonstrated that loss of one copy of Ets2 was sufficient for prostate cancer progression when under a Pten-null background. Collectively, our data suggest that ETS2 is a prostate tumor suppressor and haploinsufficiency of one or more interstitial genes contributes to prostate cancer progression.

Inactivating mutations in the MEN1 gene predisposing to the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome can also cause sporadic pancreatic endocrine tumors. MEN1 encodes menin, a subunit of MLL1/MLL2-containing histone methyltransferase complexes that trimethylate histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3). The importance of menin-dependent H3K4me3 in normal and transformed pancreatic endocrine cells is unclear. To study the role of menin-dependent H3K4me3, we performed in vitro differentiation of wild-type as well as menin-null mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) into pancreatic islet-like endocrine cells (PILECs). Gene expression analysis and genome-wide H3K4me3 ChIP-Seq profiling in wild-type and menin-null mESCs and PILECs revealed menin-dependent H3K4me3 at the imprinted Dlk1-Meg3 locus in mESCs, and all four Hox loci in differentiated PILECs. Specific and significant loss of H3K4me3 and gene expression was observed for genes within the imprinted Dlk1-Meg3 locus in menin-null mESCs and the Hox loci in menin-null PILECs. Given that the reduced expression of genes within the DLK1-MEG3 locus and the HOX loci is associated with MEN1-like sporadic tumors, our data suggests a possible role for menin-dependent H3K4me3 at these genes in the initiation and progression of sporadic pancreatic endocrine tumors.

Nucleosomal incorporation of specialized histone variants is an important mechanism to generate different functional chromatin states. Here we report the identification and characterization of two novel primate-specific histone H3 variants, H3.X and H3.Y. Their mRNAs are found in certain human cell lines, in addition to several normal and malignant human tissues. In keeping with their primate-specificity, H3.X and H3.Y are detected in different brain regions. Transgenic H3.X and H3.Y proteins are stably incorporated into chromatin in a similar fashion to the known H3 variants. Importantly, we demonstrate biochemically and by mass spectrometry that endogenous posttranslationally modified H3.Y protein exists in vivo, and that stress-stimuli, such as starvation and cellular density, increase the abundance of H3.Y-expressing cells.

    "text": "Detained introns are novel, widespread class of posttranscriptionally-spliced introns. Removal of introns by pre-mRNA splicing is a critical and in some cases rate-limiting step in mammalian gene expression. Deep sequencing of mouse embryonic stem cell RNA revealed many specific internal introns that are significantly more abundant than the other introns within poly(A) selected transcripts; we classify these as \"detained\" introns (DIs). We identified thousands of DIs flanking both constitutive and alternatively spliced exons in human and mouse cell lines. Drug inhibition of Clk SR-protein kinase activity triggered rapid splicing changes in a specific set of DIs, about half of which showed increased splicing and half increased intron detention, altering the transcript pool of over 300 genes. These data suggest a widespread mechanism by which a nuclear detained pool of mostly processed pre-mRNAs can be rapidly mobilized in response to stress or homeostatic autoregulation. v6.5 mouse embryonic stem cells were untreated, treated with the Clk kinase inhibitor KH-CB19, or treated with DMSO as a negative control. Untreated cells were harvested and a single replicate was sequenced using a custom, ligation-based, stranded library preparation protocol. Treated cells were harvested at time 0 and at 2 hours post-treatment, and poly(A)-selected RNA-seq libraries were made from biological duplicates for each treatment/time, barcoded, and sequenced by strand-specific, paired-end sequencing using the Illumina TruSeq kit.",

Human blood platelets have important, regulatory functions in diverse hemostatic and pathological disorders, including vascular remodeling, inflammation, and wound repair. Microarray analysis was used to study the molecular basis of essential thrombocythemia, a myeloproliferative disorder with quantitative and qualitative platelet defects associated with cardiovascular and thrombohemorrhagic symptoms, not infrequently neurological. A platelet-expressed gene (HSD17B3) encoding type 3 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (previously characterized as a testis-specific enzyme catalyzing the final step in gonadal synthesis of testosterone) was selectively down-regulated in ET platelets, with reciprocal induction of the type 12 enzyme (HSD17B12). Functional 17beta-HSD3 activity corresponding to approximately 10% of that found in murine testis was demonstrated in normal platelets. The induction of HSD17B12 in ET platelets was unassociated with a concomitant increase in androgen biosynthesis, suggesting distinct functions and/or substrate specificities of the types 3 and 12 enzymes. Application of a molecular assay distinguished ET from normal platelets in 20 consecutive patients (p < 0.0001). These data provide the first evidence that distinct subtypes of steroidogenic 17beta-HSDs are functionally present in human blood platelets, and that the expression patterns of HSD17B3 and HSD17B12 are associated with an uncommon platelet disorder manifest by quantitative and qualitative platelet defects.Keywords: other.",

Previous studies from our lab implicate 15-LOX2 as a functional tumor suppressor. To better understand the biological role of 15-LOX2 in vivo, we established prostate-specific 15-LOX2 transgenic mice using the ARR2PB promoter. Unexpectedly, 15-LOX2 expression resulted in age-dependent prostatic hyperplasia. Interestingly, transgenic expression of 15-LOX2sv-b, a splice variant that lacks the arachidonic acid metabolizing activity, also induced hyperplasia and enlargement of the prostate. Prostatic hyperplasia induced by both 15-LOX2 and 15-LOX2sv-b was associated with an increase in proliferative (i..e., Ki67+) and luminal cells but 15-LOX2-induced hyperplasia was also accompanied by a prominent increase in basal cells. Microarray analysis revealed distinct gene expression profiles that could help explain the prostate phenotypes. Strikingly, 15-LOX2 (but not 15-LOX2sv-b) transgenic prostate showed up-regulation of several well-known stem/progenitor cell molecules including Sca-1, Trop2, p63 and Psca. Prostatic hyperplasia caused by both 15-LOX2 and 15-LOX2sv-b did not progress to PCa over >5 years of observations. Mechanistically, hyperplastic prostate lobes (especially those of the 15-LOX2 mice) showed a dramatic increase in senescent cells revealed by increased SA-ssgal, HP1, and p27Kip1 staining. Collectively, our results suggest that 15-LOX2 expression in mouse prostate leads to hyperplasia that activates the senescence checkpoint, which may in turn function as a barrier to tumor development. RNA was isolated from combined prostatic lobes of 6 mice (to reduce inter-animal variation) from ~2.5 month old (young; y) 15-LOX2 (line fl26), 15-LOX2sv-b (line svb9), wild type (wt) and ~15 month old (old; o) wt mice and hybridized onto Agilent's whole mouse genome oligoarrays arrays (G4122A) in fl26y(vs)wty, svb9y(vs)wty and wto(vs)wty combinations.

In the germline stem cell lineage, proliferating gonial cells switch from mitotic proliferation to meiotic prophase, marked by the onset of a cell-type-specific transcription program and a specialized cell cycle required to generate haploid gametes. The Drosophila gene benign gonial cell neoplasm (bgcn) encodes an RNA binding translational repressor required in fly testes for spermatogonia to stop dividing and transition to the spermatocyte state and meiosis. Here we show that the mammalian bgcn ortholog, YTHDC2, plays a key role in allowing a clean transition from mitosis to meiosis in both male and female germ cells in mouse, pointing towards a conserved role of post-transcriptional control of RNA translation and/or stability in this critical cell fate transition. Ythdc2-/- male germ cells undergo mitotic divisions but fail to properly execute meiotic prophase, instead attempting a mitotic-like division then undergoing cell death. Many meiotic markers were only weakly expressed in Ythdc2-/- testes compared to wild-type controls. Strikingly, the mitotic cyclin Cyclin A2, which is down-regulated prior to entry into meiotic prophase in wild-type, remained high in Ythdc2-/- germ cells that also expressed the meiotic marker SYCP3, suggesting that the mutant germ cells attempting to enter meiotic prophase have a mixed identity. YTHDC2 binds RNAs involved in both the mitotic cell cycle, including the mRNA Ccna2 that encodes Cyclin A2, as well as specific piRNA precursor RNAs and transcripts required for later stages of germ cell differentiation. YTHDC2-bound RNAs in testes were enriched for the m6A modification, suggesting that YTHDC2 may selectively regulate multiple target RNAs marked with m6A, to promote a clean transition from mitosis to meiosis and terminal differentiation. mRNA profiles for wild-type and YTHDC2/BGCN testis at P12 and P14 were generated by RNA sequencing. m6A modified transcripts were identified by immunopreciitation with an anti-m6A specific antibody followed by sequencing for P12 testes.",

EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors cause dramatic responses in EGFR-mutant lung cancer, but resistance universally develops. The involvement of b-catenin in EGFR TKI resistance has been previously reported however the precise mechanism by which b-catenin activation contributes to EGFR TKI resistance is not clear. Here, we show that EGFR inhibition results in the activation of b-catenin signaling in a Notch3-dependent manner, which facilitates the survival of a subset of cells that we call \"adaptive persisters\". We previously reported that EGFR-TKI treatment rapidly activates Notch3, and here describe the physical association of Notch3 with b-catenin, leading to increased stability and activation of b-catenin. We demonstrate that the combination of EGFR-TKI and a b-catenin inhibitor inhibits the development of these adaptive persisters, decreases tumor burden, improves recurrence free survival, and overall survival in xenograft models. These results supports combined EGFR-TKI and b-catenin inhibition in patients with EGFR mutant lung cancer. HCC4006 cells were transfected with NTC, Notch1 or Notch3 siRNAs.

Translation is a fundamental biological process and ribosomes are essential in all cells, but defects in ribosome biogenesis (ribosomopathies) disproportionately cause hematopoietic dysfunction of red blood cells and platelets. Here, we analyze translation in primary human reticulocytes and platelets by ribosome profiling and uncover dramatic accumulation of post-termination, unrecycled ribosomes in the 3'UTRs of mRNAs. We then demonstrate that these ribosomes accumulate as a result of the natural loss of the ribosome recycling factor ABCE1 during terminal differentiation. We find that induction of ribosome rescue factors PELO and HBS1L is required to maintain translational homeostasis when ABCE1 levels fall. This activation of ribosome rescue mitigates the effects of ribosome shortage on translational output, including on hemoglobin production. Our observations suggest that this distinctive loss of ABCE1 in anucleate blood lineages sensitizes them to defects in ribosome homeostasis and that activation of a ribosome rescue pathway plays a lineage-specific role in maintaining ribosome homeostasis during blood cell development.

Hence, there is a need to overcome this limitation by development of a model system that allows us to mimic each stage of EMT and accurately assess the plastic changes associated with it.Methods: We have derived a cancer cell line from the PyMT-MMTV model of breast cancer, named PyMT-1099 cells, and undertaken a detailed characterization of the morpho-genetic changes it undergoes during a TGFbeta-induced EMT. Further, we have also performed high throughput transcriptomics on PyMT-1099 cells undergoing EMT in a high resolution kinetic of TGFbeta treatment.Results: We show that PyMT-1099 cells undergo an EMT comparable to the classically used immortalized NMuMG cells as assessed by morphological, and marker expression changes on TGFbeta treatment. Further, PyMT-1099 cells can also migrate in vitro in response to TGFbeta treatment. These cells are also tumorigenic and lead to metastasis formation when transplanted into immunocompromised mice.Conclusion: In this study we report the development of PyMT-1099 cells as an excellent tool to model and study breast cancer-associated EMT both in vitro and in vivo and show that these cells overcome the limitations posed by other cellular systems currently being used to study EMT.

    "text": "Integrative Epigenetic and Gene Expression Analysis of Renal Tumor Progression to Metastasis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is among the ten most common malignancies. By far, the most common histology is clear cell (ccRCC). The Cancer Genome Atlas and other large scale sequencing studies of ccRCC have been integral to the current understanding of molecular events underlying RCC and its biology. However, these data sets have focused on primary RCC which often demonstrates indolent behavior. In contrast, metastatic disease is the major cause of mortality associated with ccRCC. However, data sets examining metastatic tumor are sparse. We therefore undertook an integrative analysis of gene expression and DNA methylome profiling of metastatic ccRCC in addition to primary RCC and normal kidney. Integrative analysis of the methylome and transcriptome identified over 30 RCC specific genes whose mRNA expression inversely correlated with promoter methylation including several known targets of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs). Notably, genes encoding several metabolism-related proteins were identified as differentially regulated via methylation. Collectively, our data provide novel insight into biology of aggressive RCC. Furthermore, they demonstrate a clear role for epigenetics in the promotion of HIF signaling and invasive phenotypes in renal cancer. Refer to individual Series.",

    "text": "Systematic Functional Dissection of Common Genetic Variation Affecting Red Blood Cell Traits [Microarray]. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of associations between common genetic variants and human disease phenotypes, but the majority of these variants are non-coding, often requiring genetic fine-mapping, extensive epigenomic profiling, and individual reporter assays to delineate potential causal variants. We employ a massively parallel reporter assay to simultaneous screen 2756 variants in strong linkage-disequilibrium with 75 sentinel variants associated with red blood cell traits. We show that this assay identifies elements with erythroid-specific endogenous regulatory activity. Across 23 variants, we conservatively identified 32 putative causal variants (PCVs). We demonstrate endogenous enhancer activity for three PCVs that predominantly affect the transcription of SMIM1, RBM38, and CD164 using targeted genome editing. Functional follow up of RBM38 delineates a key role for this gene in the dramatic alternative splicing program occurring during terminal erythropoiesis. Finally, we provide evidence for how common GWAS-nominated variants can disrupt cell-type specific transcriptional regulatory pathways. We infected K562 cells with a HMD-GATA1 lentiviral vector that overexpresses GATA1 as described previously and below (Ludwig et al., 2014). RNA was isolated 48 hours after infection and cDNA was synthesized as described below. Microarrays (GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST Arrays, Affymetrix) were performed on K562 for control (HMD) and GATA1 overexpression (HMD+GATA1). Raw files were processed and normalized using the RMA algorithm from the oligo package in R 3.2 (Carvalho and Irizarry, 2010). Differential expression analyses were conducted using limma (Ritchie et al., 2015). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed comparing GATA1 overexpression to control with gene set permutation (Subramanian et al., 2005). The erythroid differentiation signature gene set was derived by identifying the top 200 genes that were expressed significantly higher in intermediate erythroblasts (CD71+/ CD235a+) compared to colony forming unit erythroid cells (CD71+/ CD235a-) (Merryweather-Clarke et al., 2011).

Hematopoietic stem cells are both necessary and sufficient to sustain the complete blood system of vertebrates. Here we show that Nfix, a member of the nuclear factor I (Nfi) family of transcription factors, is highly expressed by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) of murine adult bone marrow. Although shRNA mediated knockdown of Nfix expression in Lineage-Sca-1+c-Kit+ HSPC had no effect on in vitro cell growth or viability, Nfix-depleted HSPC displayed a significant loss of colony forming potential, as well as short- and long-term in vivo hematopoietic repopulating activity. Analysis of recipient mice 4-20 days post-transplant revealed that Nfix-depleted HSPC establish in the bone marrow but fail to persist due to increased apoptotic cell death. Gene expression profiling of Nfix-depleted HSPC reveals that loss of Nfix expression in HSPC is concomitant with a decrease in the expression of multiple genes known to be important for HSPC survival, such as Erg, Mecom, Mpl and Prdm16. These data reveal that Nfix is a novel regulator of HSPC survival post-transplantation and establish, for the first time, a role for Nfi genes in the regulation of this cellular compartment. 3 NFIX depleted samples are compared to 3 wt samples.",

Mouse naive pluripotent stem cells (ESC) can contribute to all embryonic tissues and the germline, but rarely to the extra-embryonic tissues in chimeric embryos. Here we describe a novel advanced pluripotent stem cell (ASC) with higher potency, since a single ASC contributes very efficiently to the fetus, germline, yolk sac and the placental labyrinth in chimeras. ASCs were derived from blastocysts in two steps in a chemically defined medium with Activin A (ActA) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), followed by Wnt and BMP. Notably, ASCs exhibit a distinct transcriptome with the expression of both naive pluripotent genes, as well as mesodermal somatic genes; Eomes, Eras, Tdgf1, Evx1, hand1, Wnt5a, and distinct repetitive elements. Established ESCs can also be readily and directly to ASCs. Importantly, ASCs exhibit a stable hypermethylated epigenome unlike the hypomethylated epiblast in blastocysts and naive ESCs, indicating that ASCs might represent a state in between the naive and primed states of pluripotency.

    "text": "Identification of targets for rational pharmacological therapy in childhood craniopharyngioma. Introduction: Pediatric adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma (ACP) is a histologically benign but clinically aggressive brain tumor that arises from the sellar/suprasellar region. Despite a high survival rate with current surgical and radiation therapy (75-95% at 10 years), ACP is associated with debilitating visual, endocrine, neurocognitive and psychological morbidity, resulting in exceptionally poor quality of life for survivors. Identification of an effective pharmacological therapy would drastically decrease morbidity and improve long term outcomes for children with ACP.Results: Using microarray analysis of 15 ACP patient samples, we have found several pharmaceutical targets that are significantly and consistently overexpressed in our panel of ACP relative to other pediatric brain tumors, pituitary tumors, normal pituitary and normal brain tissue. Among the most highly expressed are several targets of the kinase inhibitor dasatinib -- LCK, EPHA2 and SRC; EGFR pathway targets -- AREG, EGFR and ERBB3; and other potentially actionable cancer targets -- SHH, MMP9 and MMP12. We confirm by Western blot that a subset of these targets is highly expressed in ACP primary tumor samples.Discussion: We report here the first microarray gene expression analysis for ACP and the identification of targets for rational therapy. Experimental drugs targeting each of these gene products are currently being tested clinically and pre-clinically for the treatment of other tumor types. This study provides a rationale for further pre-clinical and clinical studies of novel pharmacological treatments for ACP. Development of pre-clinical mouse and cell culture models for ACP will further enable the translation of these targets from the lab to the clinic. Gene expression profiles were generated from surgical tumor and normal brain samples (n=210) using Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 chips.Gene expression profiles of adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma (ACP) were compared to a cohort of other tumor samples and normal brain tissues, and analyzed via gene set enrichment (GSEA analysis) and hierarchical clustering analysis to identify high expression of potential drug targets.The sample metadata and processed data for the complete dataset, which includes reanalysis of 23 Samples from GSE26966, 33 Samples from GSE35493, and 42 Samples from GSE50385, are linked below as supplementary files.",

The host genotype has been proposed to contribute to individually composed bacterial communities in the gut. To provide deeper insight into interactions between gut bacteria and their host, we associated germ-free C3H and C57BL/10 mice with intestinal bacteria from a C57BL/10 donor mouse. Analysis of microbiota similarity between the experimental animals with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) 13 weeks after association revealed the development of a mouse strain specific microbiota. Gene expression in the colonic mucosa was analyzed with a microarray approach taking advantage of a modified Affymetrix mouse genome chip. We detected 202 genes whose expression differed significantly by a factor of < 2. Application of bioinformatics tools demonstrated that functional terms including signaling/secretion, lipid degradation/catabolism, guanine nucleotide/guanylate binding and immune response were significantly enriched in differentially expressed genes. We had a closer look at the 56 genes with expression differences of < 4 and observed a higher expression in C57BL/10 mice of the genes coding for toll-like receptor 1 (4-fold) and angiogenin 4 (33-fold) which are involved in the recognition and response to gut bacteria. In contrast, a 70-fold higher expression of the phospholipase A2, group IIA-encoding gene (Pla2g2a) was detected in C3H mice. In addition, a number of interferon-inducible genes were higher expressed in C3H than in C57BL/10 mice including Gbp1 (18-fold), Mal (7-fold), Oasl2 (7-fold), Ifi202b (7-fold), Rtp4 (6-fold), Ly6g6c (5-fold), Ifi27l2a (5-fold), Usp18 (5-fold), Ifit1 (5-fold), Ifi44 (4-fold), and Ly6g (4-fold) indicating that these cytokines play an essential role in microbiota regulation. However, genes coding for interferons, their receptors or factors involved in interferon signaling pathways were not differentially expressed between the two mouse strains. Taken together, our study confirms that the host genotype is involved in the establishment of host-specific bacterial communities in the gut. Based on expression differences after colonization with the same bacterial inoculum, we propose that Pla2g2a and interferon-dependent genes may contribute to this phenomenon. Total RNA was extracted from the colonic mucosa and hybridization was performed using 12.5 - 20 ug of cDNA on a customized Affymetrix nugomm 1a520177 chip.",

BATF functions in both T cells and B cells to control the host response to antigen and promote the production of class switched immunoglobulins. In this study, we demonstrate that BATF expression is increased rapidly, and transiently, immediately following B cell stimulation and use an inducible model of BATF deletion to show that this induction is necessary, and sufficient, to trigger the program of immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR). We identify two genes (Nfil3 and miR155gh) that are positively regulated and one gene (Wnt10a) that is negatively regulated by BATF during CSR. All three of these BATF targets play an essential role in CSR and each impacts the expression and/or function of the others.

Mammalian motor circuits control voluntary movements by transmitting signals from the central nervous system (CNS) to muscle targets. To form these circuits, motor neurons (MNs) must extend their axons out of the CNS. Although motor axon exit from the CNS is an indispensable phase of motor axon pathfinding, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we present the first identification of a genetic pathway that regulates motor axon exit from the vertebrate spinal cord, utilizing spinal accessory motor neurons (SACMN) as a model system. SACMN are a homogeneous population of spinal MNs whose axons leave the CNS through a discrete lateral exit point (LEP) and can be visualized by the expression of the cell surface protein, BEN. We show that the homeodomain transcription factor, Nkx2.9, is selectively required for SACMN axon exit and identify the Robo2 guidance receptor as a likely downstream effector of Nkx2.9; loss of Nkx2.9 leads to a reduction in Robo2 mRNA and protein within SACMN and SACMN axons fail to exit the spinal cord in Robo2-deficient mice. Consistent with short-range interactions between Robo2 and Slit ligands regulating SACMN axon exit, Robo2-expressing SACMN axons normally navigate through LEP-associated Slits as they emerge from the spinal cord, and fail to exit in Slit-deficient mice. Our studies support the view that Nkx2.9 controls SACMN axon exit from the mammalian spinal cord by regulating Robo-Slit signaling. We utilized microarray technology to identify novel downstream effectors of the homeodomain transcription factor, Nkx2.9, that regulate spinal accessory motor neuron development.",

With aging, significant changes in circadian rhythms occur, including a shift in phase toward a \"morning\" chronotype and a loss of rhythmicity in circulating hormones. However, the effects of aging on molecular rhythms in the human brain have remained elusive. Here we employed a previously-described time-of-death analyses to identify transcripts throughout the genome that have a significant circadian rhythm in expression in the human prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's areas (BA) 11 and 47). Expression levels were determined by microarray analysis in 146 individuals. Rhythmicity in expression was found in ~10% of detected transcripts (p<0.05). Using a meta-analysis across the two brain areas, we identified a core set of 235 genes (q<0.05) with significant circadian rhythms of expression. These 235 genes showed 92% concordance in the phase of expression between the two areas. In addition to the canonical core circadian genes, a number of other genes were found to exhibit rhythmic expression in the brain. Notably, we identified more than one thousand genes (1186 in BA11; 1591 in BA47) that exhibited age-dependent rhythmicity or alterations in rhythmicity patterns with aging. Interestingly, a set of transcripts gained rhythmicity in older individuals, which may represent a compensatory mechanism due to a loss of canonical clock function. Thus, we confirm that rhythmic gene expression can be reliably measured in human brain and identified for the first time significant changes in molecular rhythms with aging that may contribute to altered cognition, sleep and mood in later life. Using the resources of the University of Pittsburgh's Brain Tissue Donation Program, 210 subjects were identified.

From small numbers of starting cells, we find a comprehensive collection of known ER, FoxA1 and E2F4 targets, plus a number of novel unexpected interactors. One of the most ER (and FoxA1) associated interactors is GREB1, an estrogen induced gene with almost no known function. We apply RIME, in parallel with ER ChIP-seq, to identify ER protein interactors and ER binding events from solid tumor xenografts, resulting in the validation of the ER-GREB1 interactions. Furthermore, we establish a method for identifying endogenous interacting proteins from solid primary breast cancer samples, whih we apply to validate ER interactions with GREB1 and additional co-factors. Mechanistically, we show that GREB1 is recruited with ER to the chromatin where it functions as an essential estrogen-mediated regulatory factor required for effective ER transcriptional activity. Our novel approach enables, for the first time, the ability for discovery and validation of protein-protein interactions in whole tissue and solid tumors, revealing significant insight into ER regulatory factors. Cells were transfected with siControl or siGREB1. The cells were treated with 10nM ICI 182780 for 24 hr to further deplete ER. 48 hr after transfection, the cells were treated with 100nM of Estrogen or vehicle for 6 hr and total RNA was collected from four biological replicates.",

The combination of fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing kidney. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene in FACS isolated components of the developing kidney.

Purpose: Nephron progenitor cells generate nephrons, the basic units of kidney. We developed methods to culture mouse and human NPCs in their self-renewal state in vitro with full nephrogenic potentials. The RNA-seq here is used to compare the global gene expression of long-term cultured mouse NPCs and their cognate freshly isolated primary NPCsMethods: mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing in duplicate from E11.5, E12.5, E13.5, E16.5 and P1 primary NPCs, and from long-term cultured NPCs derived from E11.5, E13.5, E16.5 and P1 (Passage 20 and Passage 80 for each cell line). To generate rpkm values from raw data, single-end 50bp reads were mapped to the UCSC mouse transcriptome (mm9) by STAR9, allowing for up to 10 mismatches (which is the default by STAR). Only the reads aligned uniquely to one genomic location were retained for subsequent analysis. And expression levels of all genes were estimated by Cufflink10 using only the reads with exact matches.Results: The gene expression levels of the \"NPC-signature genes\" were firstly transformed as logarithm scales. And then the program \"prcomp\", a built-in program for principal component analysis in R packages, was employed with default parameters. We evaluated the variance percentage of each principal component, and found the top 3 components accounted for 84.1% of the total variance, where PC1 accounted for 46.42%, PC2 23.87% and PC3 13.81%. Those three PCs are therefore selected as candidate principal components in the further analysis. Another program \"scatterplot3d\" in the R packages was used to plot the 3D view of PCA, and \"ggplot2\" was used in 2D view of PCA. The PCA results indicate that cultured NPCs cluster together in PCA analysis while primary NPCs segregate into early (E11.5 to E13.5) and later (E16.5, P1) NPC groups. Interestingly, cultured NPCs are close to early NPCs in both PC1 and PC2 axes, suggesting that cultured NPCs are maintained in state close to early NPCs. The close cluster of P20 and P80 NPCs show the robustness of our culture condition in maintaining stable self-renewal state of NPCs.Conclusions: Our study represents the first analysis comparing the long-term cultured NPC lines we geneated with primary NPCs, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. The optimized data analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles. Our results show that NGS offers a comprehensive and more accurate quantitative and qualitative evaluation of mRNA content within a cell or tissue. We conclude that RNA-seq based transcriptome characterization would expedite genetic network analyses and permit the dissection of complex biologic functions. mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing in duplicate from E11.5, E12.5, E13.5, E16.5 and P1 primary NPCs, and from long-term cultured NPCs derived from E11.5, E13.5, E16.5 and P1 (Passage 20 and Passage 80 for each cell line).",

Cerebral palsy is primarily an upper motor neuron disease that results in a spectrum of progressive movement disorders. Secondary to the neurological lesion, muscles from patients with cerebral palsy are often spastic and form debilitating contractures that limit range of motion and joint function. With no genetic component, the pathology of skeletal muscle in cerebral palsy is a response to aberrant neurological input in ways that are not fully understood. This study was designed to gain further understanding of the skeletal muscle response to cerebral palsy using microarrays and correlating the transcriptional data with functional measures. Hamstring biopsies from gracilis and semitendinosus muscles were obtained from a cohort of patients with cerebral palsy (n=10) and typically developing patients (n=10) undergoing surgery. Affymetrix HG-U133A 2.0 chips (n=40) were used and expression data was verified for 6 transcripts using quantitative real-time PCR, as well as for two genes not on the microarray. Chips were clustered based on their expression and those from patients with cerebral palsy clustered separately. Significant genes were determined conservatively based on the overlap of three summarization algorithms (n=1,398). Significantly altered genes were analyzed for over-representation among gene ontologies, transcription factors, pathways, microRNA and muscle specific networks. These results centered on an increase in extracellular matrix expression in cerebral palsy as well as a decrease in metabolism and ubiquitin ligase activity. The increase in extracellular matrix products was correlated with mechanical measures demonstrating the importance in disability. These data lay a framework for further studies and novel therapies. Skeletal muscle biopsies from both the gracilis and semitendinosus were obtained during surgery for 20 pediatric subjects for affymetrix microarray analysis. We obtained a group of 10 patients undergoing medial hamstring lengthening in the cerebral palsy group and 10 patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with hamstring autograft in the control group. This provided 40 microarrays in 4 groups to analyze the effect of cerebral palsy and also differences between muscles.",

Infant B-acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL) that harbor MLL-AF4 rearrangements are associated with a poor prognosis. One important obstacle to progress for this patient population is the lack of models that faithfully recapitulate the short latency and aggressiveness of this disease. While current mouse models of Mll-Af4 can generate acute leukemia, not all are lymphoid, and the long latency to disease does not reflect what is seen in patients. Recent whole genome sequencing of MLL-AF4 B-ALL samples revealed a high frequency of mutations in proto-oncogenes involved in signaling pathways. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of activating mutant N-RasG12D cooperates with Mll-Af4 to generate a highly aggressive, serially transplantable B-ALL in mice. We used our novel mouse model to test the sensitivity of Mll-Af4/N-RasG12D leukemia to small molecule inhibitors, and found that dual targeting of the downstream effectors of Ras and the DNA damage response pathway through ATR inhibition induced long-term durable responses in both mouse and patient derived xenografts with both mutations in vivo. Our studies suggest that this mouse model of Mll-Af4/N-Ras B-ALL is not only a powerful tool to explore the molecular and genetic pathogenesis of this disease subtype, but also is an important preclinical discovery platform for novel therapeutics that might be used to treat patients with this disease.

Collagen deposition is a key process during idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF); however, little is known about the dynamics of collagen formation during disease development. Tissue samples of early stages of human disease are not readily available and it is difficult to identify changes in collagen content, since standard collagen analysis does not distinguish between 'old' and 'new' collagen. Therefore, the current study aimed to (i) investigate the dynamics of new collagen formation in mice using bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in which newly synthesized collagen was labelled with deuterated water and (ii) use this information to identify genes and processes correlated to new collagen formation from gene expression analysis.Lung fibrosis was induced in female C57BL/6 mice by bleomycin instillation and sacrificed. Animals were sacrificed at 1 to 5 weeks after fibrosis induction. Collagen synthesized during the week before sacrifice was labelled with deuterium by providing mice with deuterated drinking water. After sacrifice, lung tissue was collected for microarray analysis, determination of new collagen formation, and histology. Deuterated water labelling showed a strong increase in new collagen formation already during the first week after fibrosis induction and a complete return to baseline at five weeks. Correlation of new collagen formation data with gene expression data revealed fibrosis specific processes, of which proliferation was an unexpected one. This was confirmed by measuring cell proliferation and collagen synthesis simultaneously using deuterated water incorporation. Furthermore, new collagen formation strongly correlated with gene expression of e.g. elastin, tenascin C, MMP-14, lysyl oxidase, and type V collagen. These data demonstrate, using a novel combination of technologies, that proliferation and extracellular matrix production are correlated to the core process of fibrosis, i.e. the formation of new collagen. In addition, it identified genes directly correlated to fibrosis, thus providing more insight into the aetiology of IPF. Total RNA was obtained from mouse lungs at timepoint 0 as a control (n = 7) or timepoints 1 (n = 7), 2 (n = 6), 3 (n = 6), 4 (n = 6) or 5 (n = 6) weeks after bleomycin-instillation to induce lung fibrosis.",

The goal of this project was to identify the downstream genes regulated by Adamts16 (the function of Adamts16 has yet to be fully delineated).

TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is normally a nuclear RNA-binding protein that exhibits a range of functions including regulation of alternative splicing, RNA trafficking and RNA stability. However, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP), TDP-43 is abnormally phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and cleaved, and is mislocalized to the cytoplasm where it forms distinctive aggregates. We previously developed a mouse model expressing human TDP-43 with a mutation in its nuclear localization signal (DNLS-hTDP-43) so that the protein preferentially localizes to the cytoplasm. These mice did not exhibit a significant number of cytoplasmic aggregates, but did display a loss of endogenous mouse nuclear TDP-43 as well as dramatic changes in gene expression as measured by microarray. Here, we analyze RNA-sequencing data from the NLS-hTDP-43 mouse model, together with published RNA-sequencing data obtained previously from TDP-43 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) knockdown mice and High Throughput Sequencing of RNA isolated by CrossLinking ImmunoPrecipitation (HITS-CLIP) data of TDP-43's RNA binding targets to further investigate the dysregulation of gene expression in the NLS model. This analysis reveals that the transcriptomic effects of the overexpression of the DNLS-hTDP-43 transgene are likely due to a gain of cytoplasmic function. Moreover, cytoplasmic TDP-43 expression alters transcripts that regulate chromatin assembly, the nucleolus, lysosomal function, and histone 3' untranslated region (UTR) processing. These transcriptomic alterations correlate with observed histologic abnormalities in heterochromatin structure and nuclear size in transgenic mouse and human brains.

However, there are currently no effective targeted therapies for this tumor type. The bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) family of proteins are transcriptional regulators that serve as scaffolds to facilitate gene transcription by binding to acetylated lysine residues in the N-terminal tail of histones. BET/BRD proteins have emerged as therapeutic targets in a broad range of tumors. We found that BET proteins are overexpressed in NRAS mutant melanoma, and that high levels of BET family member BRD4 are associated with poor patient survival, suggesting that BRD4 plays a key role in melanoma. Consequently, we hypothesized that these epigenetic regulators constitute potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited for melanoma treatment. We found that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of BET/BRD proteins decreases viability and inhibits proliferation of NRAS mutant melanoma cells, as well as BRAF/MEK-inhibitor resistant melanoma cells harboring concurrent BRAF/NRAS mutations. However, BET inhibitors when used as single agents were either cytostatic (in vitro) or ineffective (in vivo). We therefore evaluated combinations that could maximize the efficacy of BET inhibitors in NRAS mutant melanoma. Here we report that co-targeting BET and MEK synergistically restrained tumor growth and significantly prolonged the survival of NRAS-mutant tumor bearing mice. RNA-sequencing and RPPA analysis revealed that co-treatment with BETi/MEKi synergistically downregulated cell cycle regulators and activated caspase-7. This study demonstrates that combined BET and MEK inhibition elicits robust synergistic therapeutic effects and supports the clinical utility of this combination therapy for NRAS mutant melanoma patients.

Accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes alters regulation of a web of interconnected genes including miRNAs, which confer hallmark capabilities and characteristic cancer features. In this study, the miRNA and mRNA expression profiles of 126 non-small cell lung cancer specimens were analyzed, with special attention given to the diversity of lung adenocarcinomas. Of those, 76 adenocarcinomas were classified into two major subtypes, developing lung-like and adult lung-like, based on their distinctive miRNA expression profiles resembling those of either developing or adult lungs, respectively. A systems biology-based approach using a Bayesian network and nonparametric regression was employed to estimate the gene regulatory circuitry functioning in patient tumors in order to identify subnetworks enriched for genes with differential expression between the two major subtypes. miR-30d and miR-195, identified as hub genes in such subnetworks, had lower levels of expression in the developing lung-like subtype, while introduction of miR-30d or miR-195 into the lung cancer cell lines evoked shifts of mRNA expression profiles towards the adult lung-like subtype. Conversely, the influence of miR-30d and miR-195 was significantly different between the developing lung- and adult lung-like subtypes in our analysis of the patient dataset. In addition, RRM2, a child gene of the miR-30d-centered subnetwork, was found to be a direct target of miR-30d. Together, our findings reveal the existence of two miRNA expression profile-defined lung adenocarcinoma subtypes with distinctive clinicopathologic features and also suggest the usefulness of a systems biology-based approach to gain insight into the altered regulatory circuitry involved in cancer development. .

The poor clinical outcome in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has been attributed to intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy and a growth-permissive tumor microenvironment. Quiescent pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are neuroendocrine, nestin-positive, lipid-accumulating cells whose homologues in the liver are the principal repository of Vitamin A esters. Upon activation, lipid droplets are lost and via transdifferentiation they become the key cell type responsible for driving the severe desmoplasia that characterizes PDA. Despite their critical role in PDA progression and chemoresistance, therapeutic strategies targeting PSCs are lacking. Here we identified the vitamin D receptor (VDR) as a master genomic regulator of PSC activation and function. In vitro we demonstrate that VDR activation reduces expression in PSCs of genes implicated in activation, inflammation, and extracellular matrix production, as well as restoring lipid droplet integrity. In vivo, the VDR ligand calcipotriol enhances the anti-tumor effects of gemcitabine by increasing intratumoral concentration 5-fold, reducing tumor volume to near baseline and lowering metastases by more than 65%. These findings implicate VDR as a master regulator of PSC activation and identify a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. RNA-Seq analyses was used to characterize cancer-associated changes between pre-activated (3-day culture) and activated (7-day culture) primary mouse PSCs, as well as control and PDA human PSCs.

Here, we report the identification and characterization of a novel heterochromatinization factor in vertebrates, Bromo Adjacent Homology Domain-containing protein 1 (BAHD1). BAHD1 interacts with HP1, MBD1, HDAC5 and with several transcription factors. Through electron and immunofluorescence microscopy studies, we show that BAHD1 overexpression directs HP1 to specific nuclear sites and promotes formation of large heterochromatic domains, which lack acetyl histone H3 and are enriched in H3 trimethylated at lysine 27. Furthermore, ectopically expressed BAHD1 colocalizes with the heterochromatic X inactive chromosome. As highlighted by whole genome microarray analysis of BAHD1 knock down cells, BAHD1 represses several proliferation and survival genes and in particular, the insulin-like growth factor II gene (IGF2). BAHD1 specifically binds the CpG-rich P3 promoter of IGF2. This region contains DNA binding sequences for the transcription factor SP1, with which BAHD1 co-immunoprecipitates. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that BAHD1 acts as a silencer by recruiting proteins that coordinate heterochromatin assembly at specific sites in the genome.We used microarrays to identify BAHD1 gene targets. We compared the transcriptome profile of BAHD1 depleted cells with siRNA to that of cells treated with control siRNA.

Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is an incurable pediatric brain tumor, resulting in the death of 200-300 children each year in the United States. Recently it was discovered that approximately 25% of all DIPG cases harbor activating mutations in ACVR1, a gene that encodes Activin A receptor (ALK2), a receptor in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway, and that DIPGs with ALK2 mutations commonly harbor an H3.1K27M mutation. Herein, we used the RCAS/TVA retroviral system to study the effects of ACVR1 mutations and H3.1K27M on DIPG pathogenesis. In vitro expression of R206H ACVR1 with and without H3.1K27M in nestin-expressing brainstem progenitors resulted in upregulation of mesenchymal markers and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed Stat3 pathway activation. Neonatal expression of ACVR1 R206H or G328V in combination with H3.1K27M and p53 deletion in nestin-expressing brainstem progenitors induced glioma-like lesions expressing mesenchymal markers with Stat3 activation but was not sufficient for full gliomagenesis. In combination with platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGFA) signaling, ACVR1 R206H and H3.1K27M significantly decreased survival and increased tumor incidence. We demonstrate that targeting the BMP signaling pathway may be an effective therapeutic strategy to treat ACVR1 R206H mutant DIPGs. Exogenous Noggin expression at tumor initiation significantly increased tumor latency and treatment of ACVR1 R206H mutant murine DIPGs with LDN212854, an ACVR1 inhibitor, significantly prolonged their survival. We confirm relevance of our model to the human disease as human DIPG models with ACVR1 mutations were also sensitive to treatment with LDN212854 in vitro. Altogether, our studies demonstrate that ACVR1 R206H and H3.1K27M promote tumor initiation, accelerate gliomagenesis, promote a mesenchymal profile in part due to Stat3 activation, and identify LDN212854 as a promising compound to treat children with DIPG. We use RNAseq to study the transcriptomal effects of ACVR1 WT or R206H ACVR1 mutation alone and in combination with H3.1K27M mutation on murine nestin-expressing brainstem progenitors at P3-5 (using RCAS/TVA).

    "text": "Combined analysis of oligonucleotide microarray data from transgenic and knockout mice identifies direct SREBP target genes [MG_U74Av2]. The synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol is regulated by three membrane-bound transcription factors: sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP)-1a, -1c, and -2. Their function in liver has been characterized in transgenic mice that overexpress each SREBP isoform and in mice that lack all three nuclear SREBPs because of gene knockout of SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) required for nuclear localization of SREBPs. Here, we use oligonucleotide arrays hybridized with RNA from livers of three lines of mice (transgenic for SREBP-1a, transgenic for SREBP-2, and knockout for SCAP) to identify genes that are likely to be direct targets of SREBPs in liver. Application of stringent combinatorial criteria to the transgenic/knockout approach allows identification of genes whose activities are likely controlled directly by the SREBPs. Transgenic mice that overexpress transcriptionally active nuclear forms of human SREBP-1a (TgSREBP-1a) or SREBP-2 (TgSREBP-2) and mice that lack SCAP (Scap-/-) in liver were used. Studies included five 12- to 16-wk-old male TgSREBP-1a and TgSREBP-2 mice and five male littermate wild-type controls. Mice were fed a high protein/low carbohydrate diet for 2 weeks before liver removal to elicit high-level expression of the nSREBPs. Studies using liver-specific Scap-/- mice included five 10- to 12-wk-old male Scap-/-;MX1-Cre and corresponding wild-type mice that received four i.p. injections of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid to induce the Cre recombinase. Mice were fed Teklad chow and livers removed 14 days after the last injection. Liver RNA was prepared using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). Equal aliquots of total RNA from each of five mice per group were pooled (total, 20 mg) and used for biotin labeling as described in the Affymetrix technical bulletin. Hybridization, washing, scanning, and analysis of the Affymetrix GeneChip Murine Genome MU74A, -B, and -C version 2 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) were carried out. Duplicate hybridizations were performed with each RNA sample and data processed with MICROARRAY SUITE 5.0 (Affymetrix) software.",

Understanding the response of memory CD8 T cells to persistent antigen re-stimulation and the role of CD4 T cell help is critical to the design of successful vaccines for chronic diseases. However, studies comparing the protective abilities and qualities of memory and naive cells have been mostly performed in acute infections, and little is known about their roles during chronic infections. Herein, we show that memory cells dominate over naive cells and are protective when present in large enough numbers to quickly reduce infection. In contrast, when infection is not rapidly reduced, memory cells are quickly lost, unlike naive cells. This loss of memory cells is due to (i) an early block in cell proliferation, (ii) selective regulation by the inhibitory receptor 2B4, and (iii) increased reliance on CD4 T cell help. These findings have important implications towards the design of T cell vaccines against chronic infections and tumors. 16 samples are analyzed: 3 replicates of secondary effector CD8 P14 T cells at day 8 post-acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection; 4 replicates of secondary effector CD8 P14 T cells at day 8 post-chronic LCMV infection; 4 replicates of primary effector CD8 P14 T cells at day 8 post-acute LCMV infection; and 5 replicates of primary effector CD8 P14 T cells at day 8 post-chronic LCMV infection.",

    "text": "New anti-cancer chemicals Ertredin and its derivatives, regulate oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis and suppress sphere formation in vitro and tumor growth in EGFRvIII-transformed cells. Background: EGFRvIII is a mutant form of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) that lacks exons 2-7. The resulting protein does not bind to ligands and is constitutively activated. The expression of EGFRvIII is likely confined to various types of cancer, particularly glioblastomas. Although an anti-EGFRvIII vaccine is of great interest, low-molecular-weight substances are needed to obtain better therapeutic efficacy. Thus, the purpose of this study is to identify low molecular weight substances that can suppress EGFRvIII-dependent transformation.Methods: We constructed a new throughput screening system and searched for substances that decreased cell survival of NIH3T3/EGFRvIII spheres under 3-dimensional (3D)-culture conditions, but retained normal NIH3T3 cell growth under 2D-culture conditions. In vivo activity was examined using a mouse transplantation model, and derivatives were chemically synthesized. Functional characterization of the candidate molecules was investigated using an EGFR kinase assay, immunoprecipitation, western blotting, microarray analysis,quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, and measurement of lactate and ATP synthesis.Results: In the course of screening 30,000 substances, a reagent, \"Ertredin,\" was found to inhibit anchorage-independent 3D growth of sphere-forming cells transfected withEGFRvIII cDNA. Ertredin also inhibited sphere formation in cells expressing wild-type EGFR in the presence of EGF. However, it did not affect anchorage-dependent 2D growth of parental NIH3T3 cells. The 3D-growth-inhibitory activity of some derivatives, including those with new structures, was similar to Ertredin. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Ertredin suppressed tumor growth in an allograft transplantation mouse model injected with EGFRvIII- or wild-type EGFR-expressing cells; a clear toxicity to host animals was not observed. Functional characterization of Ertredin in cells expressing EGFRvIII indicated that it stimulated EGFRvIII ubiquitination, suppressed both oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis under 3D conditions, and promoted cell apoptosis.Conclusion: We developed a high throughput screening method based on anchorage-independent sphere formation induced by EGFRvIII-dependent transformation. In the course of screening, we identified Ertredin, which inhibited anchorage-independent 3D growth and tumor formation in nude mice. Functional analysis suggests that Ertredin suppresses both mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and cytosolic glycolysis in addition to promoting EGFRvIII degradation, and stimulates apoptosis in sphere-forming, EGFRvIII-overexpressing cells. Patterns of gene expression in cells treated with Ertredin (sample 2), rotenone (sample 3), and AG1478 (sample 4) were compared with vehicle-control cells (sample 1).",

The long-term goal of our study is to understand the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of breast cancer metastasis in human and to discover new possible genetic markers for use in clinical practice. We have used microarray technology (Human OneArray microarray, phylanxbiotech.com) to compare gene expression profiles of non-invasive MCF-7 and invasive MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to dioscin (DS), a steroidal saponin isolated from the roots of wild yam, (Dioscorea villosa). Initially the differential expression of genes (DEG) was identified that followed pathway enrichment analysis (PEA). Of the genes queried on OneArray, we identified 4641 DEG changed between MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (vehicle-treated) with cut-off log2 |fold change|>= 1. Among these genes, 2439 genes are upregulated and 2002 genes are downregulated. DS exposure (2.30 M, 72 h) to these cells identified 801 (MCF-7) and 96 (MDA-MB-231) DEG that showed significant difference compared to untreated cells (p<0.05). Within these gene sets, DS is able to upregulate 395 genes and downregulate 406 genes in MCF-7 and upregulate 36 and downregulate 60 genes in MDA-MB-231 cells. Further comparison of DEG between MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to DS identified 3626 DEG of which 1700 were upregulated and 1926 genes were down-regulated. From PEA, 12 canonical pathways were significantly altered between these two cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231). However, no alteration in any of these pathways was noticed in MCF-7 cell, while in MDA-MB-231 cells only MAPK pathway showed significant alteration. When PEA comparison was made on DS exposed cells, it was observed that only 2 pathways were significantly affected. Further, to identify shared DEG, which are targeted by DS and overlapped in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, we performed intersection analysis (Venn diagram). We found that only 7 DEG are overlapped of which six are reported in the database. This study highlights the diverse gene networks and pathways through which DS exhibits its effect on breast cancer cells. Two condition experiment.

To test the hypotheses that mutant huntingtin protein length and wild-type huntingtin dosage have important effects on disease-related transcriptional dysfunction, we compared the changes in mRNA in seven genetic mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD) and postmortem human HD caudate. Transgenic models expressing short N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin (R6/1 and R6/2 mice) exhibited the most rapid effects on gene expression, consistent with previous studies. Although changes in the brains of knock-in and full-length transgenic models of HD took longer to appear, 15- and 22-month CHL2(Q150/Q150), 18-month Hdh(Q92/Q92) and 2-year-old YAC128 animals also exhibited significant HD-like mRNA signatures. Whereas it was expected that the expression of full-length huntingtin transprotein might result in unique gene expression changes compared with those caused by the expression of an N-terminal huntingtin fragment, no discernable differences between full-length and fragment models were detected. In addition, very high correlations between the signatures of mice expressing normal levels of wild-type huntingtin and mice in which the wild-type protein is absent suggest a limited effect of the wild-type protein to change basal gene expression or to influence the qualitative disease-related effect of mutant huntingtin. The combined analysis of mouse and human HD transcriptomes provides important temporal and mechanistic insights into the process by which mutant huntingtin kills striatal neurons. In addition, the discovery that several available lines of HD mice faithfully recapitulate the gene expression signature of the human disorder provides a novel aspect of validation with respect to their use in preclinical therapeutic trials.Keywords: genetic modification.

Rationale: Despite the deleterious effects associated with elevated carbon dioxide (CO2), or hypercapnia, it has been hypothesized that CO2 can protect the lung from injury. However, the effects of chronic hypercapnia on the neonatal lung are unknown.Objectives: To determine whether chronic hypercapnia alters alveolar development and to identify genes that could potentially contribute to hypercapnia-mediated lung protection. Methods: Newborn mouse litters were exposed to 8% CO2, 12% CO2 or room air for 2 weeks. Lungs were excised and analyzed for morphometric alterations. Gene expression changes were assessed by microarray techniques and RT-PCR, and gene products by western blotting. Results: The alveolar walls of CO2-exposed mice appeared thinner than those of controls. In addition, genes from a variety of functional categories were differentially expressed with hypercapnia, including those involved with cell growth/maintenance, signal transduction, protein metabolism, ion transport, stress response and inflammation. In particular and of major interest, gene expression was increased for surfactant proteins (SP) A and D, epithelial Na+ channel, GATA binding protein 6 and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2. In addition, SP-A and SP-D protein expression was increased with hypercapnia. Conclusions: Our results lead us to conclude that: 1) There are potentially a number of gene families which may contribute to hypercapnia-mediated lung protection, and 2) up-regulation of SP-A and SP-D may play a role as anti-inflammatory or antioxidant agents. Based on our genomic results, the effects of CO2 depend on the level to which the lung is exposed.Keywords: stress response. Total 5 arrays including 2 dye-swaps were performed for the 8% CO2 treated animals. Five individual animals were analyzed.Total 4 arrays including 2 dye-swaps were performed for the 12% CO2 treated animals. Four individual animals were analyzed.",

Previous studies have suggested that the heart may be capable of limited repair and regeneration in response to a focal injury while other studies indicate that the mammalian heart has no regenerative capacity. To further explore this issue, we performed a series of superficial and transmural myocardial injuries in C57BL/6 and MRL/MpJ adult mice. At defined time intervals following the respective injury (Days 3, 14, 30 and 60) we examined cardiac function using echocardiography, morphology, FACS cell sorting for BrdU positive cells and molecular signature using microarray analysis. We observed complete restoration of myocardial function in the superficial MRL cryoinjured heart and significantly less scar formation as compared to the injured hearts of C57BL/6 mice. Following a severe transmural myocardial injury, the MRL mouse has increased survival and decreased ventricular remodeling compared to the C57BL/6 mouse but without evidence of significant regeneration. The cytoprotective program observed in the severely injured MRL heart is in part due to increased vasculogenesis and decreased apoptosis that limits the extension of the injury. We conclude that C57BL/6 and MRL injured hearts have evidence of limited myocardial regeneration, in response to superficial injury, but the improved function and survival observed in the MRL mouse heart following severe injury is not due to significant regenerative processes.Keywords: time course. Mouse hearts from C57BL/6 and MRL/MpJ strains were injured with LAD ligation and harvested at 3, 30 and 60 days after treatement.",

In order to make a significant impact on survival of patients with this malignancy, it is necessary to diagnose the disease early, when curative surgery is still possible. Detailed knowledge of the natural history of the disease and molecular events leading to its progression is therefore critical.Methods and Findings: We have analysed the precursor lesions, PanINs, from prophylactic pancreatectomy specimens of patients from four different kindreds with high risk of familial pancreatic cancer who were treated for histologically proven PanIN-2/3. Thus, the material was procured before pancreatic cancer has developed, rather than from PanINs in a tissue field that already contains cancer. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling using such unique specimens was performed. Bulk frozen sections displaying the most extensive but not microdissected PanIN-2/3 lesions were used in order to obtain the holistic view of both the precursor lesions and their microenvironment. A panel of 76 commonly dysregulated genes that underlie neoplastic progression from normal pancreas to PanINs and PDAC were identified. In addition to shared genes some differences between the PanINs of individual families as well as between the PanINs and PDACs were also seen. This was particularly pronounced in the stromal and immune responses.Conclusions: Our comprehensive analysis of precursor lesions without the invasive component provides the definitive molecular proof that PanIN lesions beget cancer from a molecular standpoint. We demonstrate the need for accumulation of transcriptomic changes during the progression of PanIN to PDAC, both in the epithelium and in the surrounding stroma. An identified 76-gene signature of PDAC progression presents a rich candidate pool for the development of early diagnostic and/or surveillance markers as well as potential novel preventive/therapeutic targets for both familial and sporadic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Gene expression of 13 PanIN samples was compared to profiling data of whole biopsies from normal donor pancreas (N1 to 4, two replicated samples) and sporadic PDAC (PDAC1 to 6).Ttwo PDAC samples (PDAC 3 and 4) and a replicate of one normal specimen (N4) were removed during the hybridisation quality assessment.",

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare genetic disease characterized by mTOR hyperfunction induced benign tumor growths in multiple organs and neurological symptoms. Because the molecular pathology is highly complex and the etiology poorly understood we employed a defined human neuronal model with a single mTOR activating mutation to dissect the disease-relevant molecular responses driving the neuropathology. TSC2 deficient neural stem cells showed severely reduced neuronal functional maturation and characteristics of astrogliosis instead. Accordingly, transcriptome analysis uncovered an inflammatory response and increased metabolic activity, while ribosome profiling revealed excessive translation of ribosomal transcripts and higher synthesis rates of angiogenic growth factors. Treatment with mTOR inhibitors corrected translational alterations but not transcriptional dysfunction. These results extend our understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of TSC brain lesions, and suggest phenotype-tailored pharmacological treatment strategies. Two TSC+/- cell lines and two TSC-/- cell lines were independently generated from wild-type human embryonic stem cells by genome editting with zinc finger nucleases. Two cell lines were handled in the same way but without any known human gene editted and they are used as negative controls.

We compared genome-wide expression profiles of undifferentiated E14.5 vs. abundantly ciliated E18.5 micro-dissected airway epithelia as well as Foxj1+ vs. Foxj1-deficient foetal (E16.5) lungs of the mouse using microarray hybridisation. 326 genes deregulated in both screens are candidates for FOXJ1-dependent, ciliogenesis-associated factors at the endogenous onset of motile ciliogenesis in the lung, including 123 genes that have not been linked to ciliogenesis before; 46% of these novel factors lack known homologues outside mammals. Microarray screening of Noto+ vs. Noto null early headfold embryos (E7.75) identified 59 of the lung candidates as NOTO/FOXJ1-dependent factors in the embryonic left-right organiser that carries a different subtype of motile cilia. For several uncharacterised factors from this small overlap - including 1700012B09Rik, 1700026L06Rik and Fam183b - we provide extended experimental evidence for a ciliary function. Microarray experiments were conducted in dual-colour mode using amplified, fluorescently labelled material from wildtype and mutant samples for co-hybridisation on one microarray. A second microarray hybridisation was performed as technical replicate with inverted dye allocation (dye-swap). In order to enable inspection of intensity values, dual-colour results were integrated into a single-color GEO matrix.",

Purpose: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone malignancy. OS consists of several subtypes including fibroblastic, osteoblastic and chondroblastic OS. We have developed genetically engineered mouse models of human OS that recapitulate two distinct subtypes, fibroblastic (Osx-CreLox p53-/- Rb-/-) and osteoblastic (Osx-Cre shRNA p53-/-) OS. The goal of this study was to identify transcriptional differences that distinguish the two subtypes.Methods: mRNA profiles of cell lines derived from tumours from Osx-Cre p53fl/fl Rbfl/fl (fibroblastic OS) and Osx-Cre shRNA TRE-p53.1224 pRbfl/fl (osteoblastic OS) mouse models were generated by RNA sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript level with TopHat followed by Cufflinks.Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 30 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build mm9) and identified 12,436 transcripts in the tumours of Osx-Cre p53fl/fl Rbfl/fl and 12,074 Osx-Cre shRNA TRE-p53.1224 pRbfl/fl with the TopHat workflow. RNA-seq data confirmed stable expression of 25 known housekeeping genes.Conclusions: Our study represents a detailed analysis of OS subtype transcriptomes generated by RNA-seq technology. mRNA profiles of cell lines derived from tumours from two genetically engineered mouse models of human osteosarcoma (Osx-Cre p53fl/fl Rbfl/fl and Osx-Cre shRNA TRE-p53.1224 pRbfl/fl) were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000.",

Gastric cancer (GC) is the second leading cause of global cancer mortality, with individual gastric tumors displaying significant heterogeneity in their deregulation of various oncogenic pathways. We aim to identify major oncogenic pathways in GC that robustly impact patient survival and treatment response. We used an in silico strategy based on gene expression signatures and connectivity analytics to map patterns of oncogenic pathway activation in 25 unique GC cell lines, and in 301 primary gastric cancers from three independent patient cohorts. Of 11 oncogenic pathways previously implicated in GC, we identified three predominant pathways (proliferation/stem cell, NF-kB, and Wnt/b-catenin) deregulated in the majority (>70%) of gastric tumors. Using a variety of proliferative, Wnt, and NF-kB-related assays, we experimentally validated the pathway predictions in multiple GC cell lines showing similar pathway activation patterns in vitro. Patients stratified at the level of individual pathways did not exhibit consistent differences in clinical outcome. However, patients grouped by oncogenic pathway combinations demonstrated robust and significant survival differences (e.g., high proliferation/high NF-kB vs. low proliferation/low NF-kB), suggesting that tumor behavior in GC is likely influenced by the combined effects of multiple oncogenic pathways. Our results demonstrate that GCs can be successfully taxonomized by oncogenic pathway activity into biologically and clinically relevant subgroups.Keywords: gastric cancer, primary tumor.

Therefore, it is expected that age-regulated changes in expression profiles could describe the process of aging. We have developed a robust and unbiased methodology to identify age-regulated expression trends in cross-sectional data sets from healthy donors. Our analysis in four different tissues reveals that in brain cortex and Vastus lateralis muscles, two major age-associated expression inclinations were found, one during midlife and one in elderly. In kidney medulla and cortex, however, transcriptional changes were found only in elderly. In concurrence with increased degeneration in aged tissue, the elderly-associated expression changes are predominantly downwards. Our results suggest that a non-linear trend describes the aging process, and can be the result of inclinations of gene expression at two distinct age-positions affecting different molecular and cellular processes.

Deletion of HIF1a impairs the propagation of CML through impairing cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis of LSCs. Deletion of HIF1a results in elevated expression of p16Ink4a and p19Arf in LSCs, and knockdown of p16Ink4a and p19Arf rescues the defective colony-forming ability of HIF1a-/- LSCs. To further identify the pathways in which Hif1a regulates function of LSCs, we performed a comparative DNA microarray analysis using total RNA isolated from BCR-ABL-expressing wild type LSCs and BCR-ABL-expressing Hif1a-/- LSCs.

Ketone bodies are essential alternative fuels that allow humans to survive periods of glucose scarcity induced by starvation and prolonged exercise. A widely used ketogenic diet (KD), that is extremely high in fat with very-low carbohydrates, drives the host into using b-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) for the production of ATP and lowers NLRP3-mediated inflammation. However, the extremely high fat composition of KD raises the question of how ketogenesis impacts adipose tissue to control inflammation and energy homeostasis. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of adipose tissue-resident immune cells, we identified that KD expands metabolically protective gd T cells that restrain inflammation. However, a long-term KD caused obesity, impaired metabolic health and depleted the adipose resident gd T cells. Moreover, mice lacking gd T cells have impaired glucose homeostasis. We conclude that gd T cells are mediators of protective immunometabolic responses that link fatty acid driven fuel utilization to reduced adipose tissue inflammation.

Genetic mutations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with critical roles have been well examined. The recent discovery of alterations in genes encoding histone modifiers suggests their possible roles in the complexity of cancer development. We previously reported loss of heterozygosity of the KDM6B gene, which encodes a histone demethylase for trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a repressive chromatin mark, in PDAC cells. In this study, we demonstrated that loss of KDM6B enhanced aggressiveness of PDAC cells. KDM6B has been regarded as a tumor suppressor that mediates oncogenic KRAS-induced senescence. Consistently, KDM6B was highly expressed in pancreatic precancerous lesions (pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms); then, the expression decreased as the malignant grade progressed. We found that knockdown of KDM6B in PDAC cells promoted tumor sphere formation and increased peritoneal dissemination and liver metastasis in vivo. Microarray and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis implicated CEBPA for aggressiveness induced by KDM6B knockdown. CEBPA knockdown recapitulated the phenotypic change of PDAC cells after KDM6B knockdown, which was reversed by forced expression of C/EBPa. Moreover, similar protein expression patterns of KDM6B and C/EBPa in human PDAC emphasized their functional correlation. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of the H3K27 methylase EZH2 in PDAC cells inhibited tumor sphere formation along with the upregulation of CEBPA expression, and this effect was impaired in KDM6B knockdown cells, highlighting the role for KDM6B in the activation of CEBPA. Together, our results propose a significant role for the KDM6B-C/EBPa axis in the PDAC phenotype. To identify genes regulated by JMJD3/KDM6B in pancreatic cancer, transcriptional profiling of BxPC3 cells transfected with either control vector or shKDM6B-expressing vector was performed using whole human genome microarrays.

Classically, macrophages are categorized into two different subsets named inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. We herein identified a unique pathogenic macrophage subpopulation, named M17, driven by IL-23 with a distinct gene expression profile including cytokines and membrane molecules. In contrast to M1 and M2-polarized macrophages, M17 macrophages express high levels of CXCR5 on the cell surface and produce large amounts of IL-17A, IL-22 and IFN-g. IL-23 induces IL-17A expression in macrophages through the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-retinoid related orphan receptor-g T (RORgT) pathway, while induces IFN-g through T-bet. Importantly, IL-23-induced M17 macrophage polarization promotes the pathogenesis of psoriasis in vivo. The characteristics and significances of M17 macrophage subpopulation in the physiological status and pathogenesis caused by infections, tumors and graft rejection needs to be explored. To further demonstrate whether M17 macrophage polarization represents a distinct polarization of macrophages, we detected gene expression profiles of M1, M2 and M17 polarized macrophages by microarray methods.",

Introduction: CHEK2 is a moderate penetrance breast cancer risk gene, whose truncating mutation 1100delC increases the risk about two fold. We pursued to investigate gene copy number aberrations and gene expression profiles that are typical for breast tumors of CHEK2 1100delC mutation carriers.Materials and methods: A total of 126 breast tumor tissue specimens including 32 samples from patients carrying CHEK2 1100delC were studied in array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and gene expression experiments (GEX). After dimensionality reduction with CGHregions R package, CHEK2 1100delC associated regions in the aCGH data were detected by Wilcoxon rank sum test. Linear model was fitted to GEX data with R package limma. Genes whose expression levels were associated with CHEK2 1100delC mutation were detected by Bayesian method.Results: We discovered four lost and three gained CHEK2 1100delC related loci. These include losses of 1p13.3-31.3, 8p21.1-2, 8p23.1-2 and 17p12-13.1 as well as gains of 12q13.11-3, 16p13.3 and 19p13.3. Twenty-eight genes located on these regions showed differential expression between CHEK2 1100delC and other tumors nominating them as candidates for CHEK2 1100delC associated tumor progression drivers. These included CLCA1 on 1p22 as well as CALCOCO1, SBEM and LRP1 on 12q13. Altogether 188 genes were differentially expressed between CHEK2 1100delC and other tumors. Of these, 144 had elevated and 44 lowered expression levels.Our results suggest WNT pathway as a driver of tumorigenesis in breast tumors of CHEK2 1100delC mutation carriers and a role for the olfactory receptor protein family in cancer progression. Differences in the expression of the 188 CHEK2 1100delC associated genes divided breast tumor samples from three independent datasets into two groups that differed in their relapse-free survival time.Conclusions: We have shown that copy number aberrations of certain genomic regions are associated with CHEK2 mutation 1100delC. On these regions we have identified potential drivers of CHEK2 1100delC associated tumorigenesis, whose role in cancer progression is worth investigating. Furthermore, poorer survival related to the CHEK2 1100delC gene expression signature highlights pathways that are likely to have a role in the development of metastatic disease in carriers of CHEK2 1100delC mutation. 78 samples from breast tumors: 13 tumors from CHEK2 1100delC mutation carriers, 65 other tumors.",

Kennedy's disease/Spinobulbar muscular atrophy (KD/SBMA) is a degenerative neuromuscular disease affecting males. This disease is caused by polyglutamine expansion mutations of the androgen receptor (AR) gene. Although KD/SBMA has been traditionally considered a motor neuron disease, emerging evidence points to a central etiological role of muscle. We previously reported a microarray study of genes regulated in muscle of three genetically unique mouse models of KD/SBMA but were unable to those which are androgen-dependent or are associated with onset of symptoms. Methodology/principal findings: In the current study we examined the time course and androgen-dependence of transcriptional changes in the HSA-AR transgenic (Tg) mouse model, in which females have a severe phenotype after acute testosterone treatment. Using microarray analysis we identified regulated genes at the onset and peak of muscle weakness in testosterone-treated Tg females. We found both transient and persistent groups of regulated genes and analysis of gene function indicated functional groups such as mitochondrion, ion and nucleotide binding, muscle development, and sarcomere maintenance. By comparing the current results with those from the three previously reported models we were able to identify KD/SBMA candidate genes that are androgen dependent, and occur early in the disease process, properties which are promising for targeted therapeutics. We used microarray (38.5K oligo mouse array, which contain 35,302 of 70mer oligonucleotide probes largely derived from constitutively expressed exons and 3,482 of controls) to analyze gene expression in limb muscles of transgenic mice. Five sample groups of 3 animals each were performed: Tg female 3 days testosterone treatment; Tg female 7d T treatment; WT untreated; WT 3d T treatment; and WT 7d T treatment. We additionally used microarray data from HSA-AR males to compare with HSA-AR females. A universal RNA reference sample made from WT (C57BL/6J) mice was utilized on each array. Triplicate arrays using RNA samples from the different experimental animals (i.e., 3 of Tg female with 3d T treatment, 3 of Tg female with 7d T treatment, 3 of untreated WT females, 3 of WT female with 3d T treatment, 3 of WT female with 7d T treatment) were performed. Log2 ratios of experimental samples (Cy5) versus reference RNA (Cy3) were obtained. The log2 ratios of Tg mice samples were then subtracted from log2 ratios of WT to find differentially regulated genes (3d T-treated Tg subtracted from 3d T-treated WT, 7d T-treated Tg subtracted from 7d T-treated WT). log2 ratios of T-treated WT were subtracted from log2 ratio of untreated WT.",

Blood, for example, contains many different cell-types, each with its own functional attributes and molecular signature. In humans, because of its accessibility and immune functionality, blood cells have been used as a source for RNA-based biomarkers for many diseases. Yet, the proportions of any given cell-type in the blood can vary markedly, even between normal individuals. This results in a significant loss of sensitivity in gene expression studies of blood cells and great difficulty in identifying the cellular source of any perturbations. Ideally, one would like to perform differential expression analysis between patient groups for each of the cell-types within a tissue but this is impractical and prohibitively expensive.To test the relationship between measured gene expression in mixed samples and the expression of genes in the isolated pure subsets, we begin with a situation in which all factors are known. Tissue samples from the brain, liver and lung of a single rat were analyzed using expression arrays (Affymetrix) in triplicate. Homogenates of those three tissues were then mixed together at the cRNA level. We then measured the gene expression pattern of each mixed sample.

Background and objective: The chromosome 13 deletion (del(13)) represents one of the most frequent chromosomal alterations in multiple myeloma (MM). del(13) is associated with an unfavorable prognosis, although there is an increasing agreement that its prognostic relevance has to be related to the ploidy status and the presence of different chromosomal translocations. This study is aimed at providing a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional features of del(13) in MM. Design and methods: Highly purified plasma cells from 80 newly diagnosed MM patients were characterized by means of FISH and high-density oligonucleotide microarray for gene expression profiling and chromosomal alterations. Results: We identified 67 differentially expressed genes in the del(13)+ and del(13)- groups, all of which downregulated in the del(13)+ cases: 44 mapped along the whole chromosome 13, seven on chromosome 11 and three on chromosome 19. Functional analyses of the selected genes indicated their involvement in protein biosynthesis, ubiquitination and transcriptional regulation. An integrative genomic approach based on regional analyses of the gene expression data identified distinct chromosomal regions whose global expression modulation could differentiate del(13)+, in particular the upregulation of 1q21-1q42 and the downregulation of 19p and almost the entire chromosome 11. FISH analyses confirmed the close relationship between del(13)+ and the presence of extracopies of 1q21-1q42 (P=6x10-4) or the absence of chromosome 11 and 19 trisomy (P=5x10-4). Interpretation and conclusions: Our results indicate that distinct types of chromosomal aberrations are closely related to the transcriptional profiles of del(13)+, suggesting that the contribution of del(13) on the malignancy should be considered together with associated abnormalities.Keywords: disease state analysis.

    "text": "Human pluripotent stem cells as a model of trophoblast differentiation in both normal development and disease. Trophoblast is the primary epithelial cell type in the placenta, a transient organ required for proper fetal growth and development. We have identified a CDX2+/p63+ cytotrophoblast (CTB) subpopulation in the early post-implantation human placenta, which is significantly reduced later in gestation. CTB differentiate into different trophoblast subtypes, which are responsible for gas/nutrient exchange (syncytiotrophoblast/STB) and invasion and maternal vascular remodeling (extravillous trophoblast/EVT). Study of early human placental development is severely hampered by lack of a representative trophoblast stem cell (TSC) model, with the capacity for self-renewal and the ability to differentiate into both STB and EVT. We describe a reproducible protocol, using defined media containing BMP4, by which human embryonic stem cells (hESC) can be differentiated into CDX2+/p63+ CTB-like cells. These cells can be replated to further differentiate into STB- and EVT-like cells, based on marker expression, hormone secretion and invasive ability. Differentiation of hPSC-derived CTB in hypoxia leads to reduced hCG secretion and STB-associated gene expression, instead inducing EVT differentiation in a hypoxia-inducible factor-dependent manner. Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) (WA09/H9) were maintained on Geltrex-coated plates (BD Biosciences ) in StemPro (Thermo Fisher) + bFGF (12 ng/ml). Undifferentiated hESC (D-2) were switched to minimal media (EMIM (Erb et al., 2011) containing KO DMEM/F12 (Gibco), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium Mix (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% NEAA (Gibco), 2mM L-Glutamine (Corning), 0.1mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibo), and 2% BSA (Gemini Bio Products)) for 2 days then treated with BMP4 (StemRD, 10ng/ml) for 3 days in minimal media+BMP4 (D3). At D3, cells were replated onto Geltrex in Feeder Conditioned Media +BMP4 and cultured in normoxia (20% O2) or hypoxia (2% O2) for 2 days (D3+2) to assess the effect of hypoxia. Cells were infected with lentiviral shRNA for shScramble (control) or shARNT, the beta subunit of the Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) complex to assess the effect of ARNT knockdown.

    "text": "Protease profiling of liver fibrosis reveals the ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 1 as a central activator of transforming growth factor beta. During chronic liver disease, tissue remodeling leads to dramatic changes and accumulation of matrix components. Matrix metalloproteases and their inhibitors have been involved in the regulation of matrix degradation. However, the role of other proteases remains incompletely defined. We undertook a gene-expression screen of human liver fibrosis samples using a dedicated gene array selected for relevance to protease activities, identifying the ADAMTS1 (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase [ADAM] with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 1) gene as an important node of the protease network. Up-regulation of ADAMTS1 in fibrosis was found to be associated with hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation. ADAMTS1 is synthesized as 110-kDa latent forms and is processed by HSCs to accumulate as 87-kDa mature forms in fibrotic tissues. Structural evidence has suggested that the thrombospondin motif-containing domain from ADAMTS1 may be involved in interactions with, and activation of, the major fibrogenic cytokine, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b). Indeed, we observed direct interactions between ADAMTS1 and latency-associated peptide-TGF-b (LAP-TGF-b). ADAMTS1 induces TGF-b activation through the interaction of the ADAMTS1 KTFR peptide with the LAP-TGF-b LKSL peptide. Down-regulation of ADAMTS1 in HSCs decreases the release of TGF-b competent for transcriptional activation, and KTFR competitor peptides directed against ADAMTS1 block the HSC-mediated release of active TGF-b. Using a mouse liver fibrosis model, we show that carbon tetrachloride treatment induces ADAMTS1 expression in parallel to that of type I collagen. Importantly, concurrent injection of the KTFR peptide prevents liver damage. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that up-regulation of ADAMTS1 in HSCs constitutes a new mechanism for control of TGF-b activation in chronic liver disease.

Background: Gene expression profiling has been used extensively within breast cancer research. Patient matched transcriptomic studies of tumour samples before and after treatment offer great potential and have been initiated, but tend not to include a control group. Here we examine gene expression changes between patient-matched core biopsies and surgical resection samples in the absence of treatment, to consider sampling methods and tumour heterogeneity. Patients and Methods: Illumina BeadArray technology was used to measure dynamic changes in gene expression from thirty-seven paired baseline and surgically excised breast tumour samples obtained from women receiving no treatment prior to surgery. Results: Patient-matched sample pairs had significantly higher correlations than samples between different individuals, demonstrating that tumour heterogeneity and intra-tumour differences are less prominent than inter-tumour/patient differences. Perhaps surprisingly, consistent changes in gene expression were identified during the diagnosis-surgery interval, despite a lack of treatment. 50 genes were significantly differentially expressed (48 up, 2 down; FDR 0.05) in a manner that appears independent of both subtype and the sampling-interval length. Gene set enrichment analysis using four independent treated datasets has implicated the tumour sampling method as the likely cause of these expression changes which include increases in early growth response genes such as EGR1, 2 and 3 along with DUSP1 and FOS. Our data does not support the idea that there is a significant wounding or immune response. Conclusion: This is the largest cohort of patient-matched transcriptome profiling of tumours from patients receiving no treatment between diagnosis and surgery to date. It has revealed that consistent changes in gene expression do exist between diagnostic core biopsy and the surgical excision sample. We have confirmed these findings in a number of published breast cancer datasets. Ultimately, researchers should be aware of the potential for the tumour sampling method to introduce a confounding factor in future neoadjuvant studies. 37 paired patient-matched whole-transcriptome profiled primary breast tumours from patients receiving no treatment between diagnosis and surgery.

The current study investigates the direct effects of in utero vinclozolin exposure on the developing rat testis transcriptome. Vinclozolin is a commonly used fungicide in agriculture and is an endocrine disruptor with anti-androgenic activity. Previous studies have demonstrated that exposure to vinclozolin during embryonic gonadal sex determination induces epigenetic modifications of the germ line and transgenerational adult onset disease states that include spermatogenic cell defects, prostate disease, kidney disease, and tumor development. An investigation of the molecular actions of vinclozolin was initiated through an analysis of direct actions on the F1 generation embryonic testis development. Microarray analyses were performed to compare control and vinclozolin treated testis transcriptomes at embryonic day 13, 14 and 16. A total of 576 differentially expressed genes were identified and the major cellular functions and pathways associated with these altered transcripts were examined. The sets of regulated genes at the different development periods were found to be transiently altered and distinct. Interestingly, genes previously shown to be regulated during normal male sex determination were not altered by vinclozolin treatment. Categorization by major known functions of all 576 genes altered by in utero vinclozolin exposure demonstrates transcription, signaling, cytoskeletal and extra cellular matrix associated transcripts are highly represented. Specific cellular process and pathway analyses suggest the involvement of Wnt and calcium signaling, vascular development and epigenetic mechanisms as potential mediators of the direct F1 generation actions of vinclozolin.For Samples 1-12: We used microarrays to determine genes expressed differentially between control and in utero Vinclozolin treated E13, E14, and E16 rat testis.For Samples 13-16: We used microarrays to determine genes expressed differentially between control and in vitro Vinclozolin treated E13 cultured rat testis.For Samples 17-20: We used microarrays to determine genes expressed differentially between control and in vitro Flutamide treated rat E13 cultured testis.

We have previously reported suppression of endometrial bleeding and alteration of spiral artery morphology in women exposed to asoprisnil, a progesterone receptor modulator (PRM). We now compare global endometrial gene expression in asoprisnil-treated versus control women and demonstrate a statistically significant reduction of genes in the IL-15 pathway, known to play a key role in uNK development and function. Suppression of IL-15 by asoprisnil was also observed at mRNA level (p<0.05), and immunostaining for NK cell marker CD56 revealed a striking reduction of uNK in asoprisnil-treated endometrium (p<0.001). IL-15 levels in normal endometrium are progesterone-responsive. Progesterone receptor (PR) positive stromal cells transcribe both IL-15 and IL-15RA. Thus, the response of stromal cells to progesterone will be to increase IL-15 trans-presentation to uNK, supporting their expansion and differentiation. In asoprisnil-treated endometrium, there is a marked down-regulation of stromal PR expression and virtual absence of uNK.

However, only half progress to invasive cancer in three years, while a third spontaneously regress. Whether modern molecular profiling techniques can identify those pre-invasive lesions that will subsequently progress and distinguish them from those that will regress is unknown. Methods: Progressive and regressive CIS lesions were laser-captured and their genome, epigenome and transcriptome interrogated. We analysed 83 progressive lesions, 41 regressive and 33 normal epithelial control samples. DNA methylation and gene expression profiles were further validated using publicly available lung cancer data. Results: Somatic mutation burden was higher in progressive lesions than regressive CIS lesions, across base substitutions, rearrangements, insertions and deletions. Driver mutations were present in both progressive and regressive CIS lesions, but were more numerous in progressive cases. Progressive and regressive CIS lesions had distinct epigenomic and transcriptional profiles, with a strong chromosomal instability signature. Gene expression, methylation and copy number profiles can all predict accurately which CIS lesions will progress to lung cancer. Conclusion: Pre-invasive CIS lesions that will subsequently progress to invasive lung cancer can be distinguished from those that will regress using molecular profiling. Progression is associated with a strong chromosomal instability signature. These findings inform the development of novel therapeutic targets.

Gene expression signatures are one potential method for identifying the tissue of origin. In the development of algorithms to identify tissue of origin, a collection of human tumor metastatic specimens with known primary sites or primary tumors with poor differentiation are very useful in identifying gene expressions signatures that can classify unknown specimens as to the tissue of origin. Here we describe a series of 276 such tumor specimens used for this purpose. The specimens are poorly differentiated, undifferentiated and metastatic specimens from tumors of the following types/tissues of origin: breast, liver, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-small cell lung cancer, ovary, testicular germ cell, thyroid, kidney, pancreas, colorectal cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, bladder, gastric cancer, prostate and melanoma. This data combined with other series (GSE2109) was used to validate a proprietary tumor classification algorithm of Pathwork Diagnostics. The results of this validation set (N = 545 CEL files) showed that the algorithm correctly identified the tissue of origin for 89.4% of the specimens.Guidelines for commercial use:http://pathworkdx.com/GSE12630_request.html. All tissue samples were fresh frozen in liquid nitrogen. The gene expression was profiled using Affymetrix GeneChip platform.Instructions for opening the Pathwork Pathchip CEL files are appended below.",

Dysregulation of the kynurenine (Kyn) pathway has been associated with the progression of Huntington's disease (HD). In particular, elevated levels of the kynurenine metabolites 3-hydroxy kynurenine (3-OH-Kyn) and quinolinic acid (Quin), have been reported in the brains of HD patients as well as in rodent models of HD. The production of these metabolites is controlled by the activity of kynurenine mono-oxygenase (KMO), a mitochondrial outer membrane enzyme which catalyzes the synthesis of 3-OH-Kyn from Kyn. Thus inhibiting KMO is expected to produce a beneficial effect in Huntington's Disease (HD) patients, hopefully reversing their phenotype to match healthy subjects. To test this effect, we acutely treated a mouse model of HD (R6/2, a transgenic mouse model of HD which contains a human HTT gene containing 90 CAG repeats) and wild type mice with a KMO inhibitor, and separately used a mock treatment on both the transgenic mice and wild type mice. The goal of this project is to analyze the RNA-seq data and find gene expression changes associated with the KMO inhibitor. 12 wk old R6/2 and WT mice were treated per os with a single dose of 10 mg/kg CHDI-00340246 or vehicle (10% (w/v) HP-b-CD in 50mM Citrate Buffer (pH 5.5)); striatum, cortex, cerebellum and liver tissues were collected 6 hrs following administration.

    "text": "Tox reinforces the phenotype and longevity of exhausted T-cells in chronic viral infection [day 8 acute vs chronic]. Chronic CD8 T-cell stimulation in persisting infections or tumors can induce a stable gene expression program, known as T-cell dysfunction or exhaustion, that limits the cell's effector functions and anti-viral and anti-tumor immunity. Thus far, the underlaying molecular mechanisms that induce and stabilize this phenotype are vaguely understood. We report here that establishing this program requires the thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group-box protein (Tox). Genetic disruption of Tox augments effector function, decreases the expression of PD-1, and significantly enhances immunopathology. These changes are linked to a failure in fixing the dysfunctional phenotype in the critical Tcf1+ progenitor population and to impaired epigenetic programing. Surprisingly, the gains in effector function co-incide with declining numbers of Tcf1+ cells and result ultimately in reduced total numbers of pathogen-specific T-cells. Thus, we establish Tox as a critical factor for the development of T-cell dysfunction and establish a clear link between CD8 T-cell intrinsic suppression of effector function and protection against immune-pathology.The terms acute and chronic samples refer to P14 T-cells that were initially activated in acute LCMV (Armstrong) or chronic LCMV (clone-13) infections. 4 weeks later, the P14 T cells were collected, transferred into naive mice, and both then re-expanded in acute LCMV (Armstrong) infection. 8 days later P14 T-cells were collected and analysed. 2*10^3 wt P14 T-cells were transferred into C57BL6 host, infected with 2x10^5 PFU LCMV Armstrong or 2x10^6 PFU LCMV-c13 and collected on day 28.

Background: In asthma, airway epithelium remodeling can already be detected during childhood, and epithelial cells are more susceptible to virus and oxidative stress. Their exact role in natural history and severity of children allergic respiratory disease remains however surprisingly unexplored.Aim: To analyze dysfunctions of epithelium in dust mite allergic respiratory disease (rhinitis +- asthma) in children.Methods: Expression profilings of nasal epithelial cells collected by brushing were performed on Affymetrix Hugene 1.0 ST arrays. All allergic patients were sensitized to dust mite. 19 patients had an isolated allergic rhinitis (AR). 14 patients had AR associated with asthma. Patients were compared to 12 controls, their severity and control being assessed according to NAEPP and ARIA criteria. Infections by respiratory viruses were excluded by real-time PCR measurements.Results: 61 probes were able to distinguish allergic rhinitis children from healthy controls. A majority of these probes was under the control of Th2 cytokines, as evidenced by parallel experiments performed on primary cultures of nasal epithelial cells. In uncontrolled asthmatic patients, we observed not only an enhanced expression of these Th2-responsive transcripts, but also a down-regulation of interferon-responsive genes.Conclusion: Our study identifies a Th2 driven epithelial phenotype common to all dust mite allergic children. Besides, it suggests that epithelium is involved in the severity of the disease. Expression profiles observed in uncontrolled asthmatic patients suggest that severity of asthma is linked at the same time to atopy and to impaired viral response.Differentiated HNECs gene expression profiling in context of Th2 and IFN cytokine stimulation.

Here, we transferred traceable yolk sac macrophages, fetal liver monocytes, adult bone marrow monocytes or adult alveolar macrophages as a control, into the empty alveolar macrophage niche of neonatal Csf2rb-/- mice. All precursors efficiently colonized the alveolar niche and generated alveolar macrophages that were transcriptionally almost identical, with only 22 genes that could be linked to their origin.

In mammalian cells, the catabolic activity of the dNTP triphosphohydrolase SAMHD1 sets the balance and the concentrations of the four dNTPs. Deficiency of SAMHD1 leads to unequally increased pools and marked dNTP imbalance. Although it is documented that imbalanced dNTP pool expansion increases mutation frequency in cancer cells, it is not known if the SAMHD1-induced dNTP imbalance favors accumulation of somatic mutations in non-transformed cells. Here we have investigated how fibroblasts isolated from Aicardi Goutieres Syndrome (AGS) patients with mutated SAMHD1 react to the constitutive pool imbalance characterized by a huge dGTP pool. We focused on the effects on dNTP pools, cell-cycle progression, dynamics and fidelity of DNA replication, efficiency of UV-induced DNA repair. AGS fibroblasts entered senescence prematurely or upregulated genes involved in G1/S transition and DNA replication. The normally growing AGS cells exhibited unchanged DNA replication dynamics and, when quiescent, faster rate of excision repair of UV-induced DNA damages than wildtype fibroblasts. To investigate if the lack of SAMHD1 affects DNA replication fidelity we compared de novo mutations in AGS and WT cells by exome next generation sequencing. Somatic variant analysis indicated a mutator phenotype suggesting that SAMHD1 is a caretaker gene whose deficiency is per se mutagenic promoting genome instability in non-transformed cells. This experiment was designed to understand if mutations on SAMHD1 gene interfere with gene expression. We used one primary cell line as control (WT) and four primary cell line carrying SAMHD1 mutantions (AGS patients). The four AGS cell lines are named P1 (AGS282 carring the mutation R145X and R164X), P2 (AGS295 carring a deletion of exons 12-16), P3 (AGS165 carring the deletion of AA 120_123), P4 (AGS128 carring the mutation Q149X).

For differential expression testing, Linear Models for MicroArray (Limma) was used to fit linear models for analyzing designed experiments and the assessment of overall gene expression and contrast analysis comparing the experimental groups. We used two different sets of experiments. In one set we used lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells and determined the gene expression profile of control (control siRNA transfected) and APE1-downregulated (APE1 siRNA transfected) A549 cells. Additionally, to examine the effect of acetylation of APE1, we used trichostatin A (TSA; which increases APE1's acetylation) and treated both control and APE1-downregulated cells with TSA (100 ng/ml) for 4 hrs. We compared the gene expression profile between (i) control vs. APE1 siRNA cells (this analysis will determine the genes whose expression is affected by APE1), and also between (ii) TSA-treated control vs. TSA-treated APE1 siRNA cells (this analysis will determine the genes whose expression is specifically affected by APE1's acetylation).

Hox and Cdx transcription factors regulate embryonic positional identities. Cdx mutant mice display posterior body truncations of the axial skeleton, neuraxis, and caudal uro-rectal structures. We show that trunk Hox genes stimulate axial extension as they can largely rescue these Cdx mutant phenotypes. Conversely, posterior (paralog group 13) Hox genes can prematurely arrest posterior axial growth when precociously expressed. Our data suggest that the transition from trunk to tail Hox gene expression successively regulates construction and termination of axial structures in the mouse embryo. Thus, Hox genes seem to differentially orchestrate posterior expansion of embryonic tissues during axial morphogenesis as an integral part of their function in specifying head-to-tail identity. In addition, we present evidence that Cdx and Hox transcription factors exert these effects by controlling Wnt signaling. Concomitant regulation of Cyp26a1 expression, restraining retinoic acid signaling in the posterior growth zone, may likewise play a role in timing the trunk-tail transition.

In this study, we coupled microarray-based transcriptomics and MS-based phosphoproteomics assay to determine mRNA, protein, and phosphopeptide expression levels from 71 autopsied temporal cortical samples, with varying degree of Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-related neurofibrillary pathology. With computational analysis, we identified disease-related transcript, protein and phosphopeptide expression patterns, associated with distinct biological processes and cell types. 71 human temporal cortical tissue samples were divided into 7 groups based on Braak staging (degree of AD-related neurofibrillary pathology) indicating the degree of disease severity. From 60 of these samples, transcripts were identified by microarray analysis. Additionally, utilizing liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) phospho-proteomics, proteins and phosphopeptides were identified from 36 samples (Data found in PRIDE). Furthermore, APOE genotype, Alpha-, beta-, and gamma-secretase activity, and amyloid-beta 42 levels were determined from the tissue samples.",

    "text": "Effect of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor or Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Exposure on Intragraft Gene Expression of Kidney Transplant Patients. Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects such as decreased growth factors and cytokines in animal models, this effect however, has not been investigated in kidney transplant recipients. We aimed to study the effect of ACEI or ARB treatment on intragraft gene expression profiles of transplant kidney biopsies using microarrays.Both groups had similar demographic characteristics in terms of age, race, sex, type of transplant, previous history of transplantation or acute rejection, panel reactive antibody levels, and immunosuppressive treatment. There were no differences in acute and chronic Banff allograft injury scores between the 2 Groups. Intragraft gene expression profiles of ACEI or ARB treated Group 2 biopsies showed decreased gene transcripts of interferon-gamma and rejection-associated transcripts (GRIT) and constitutive macrophage-associated transcripts (CMAT) compared to Group 1 biopsies. There were no statistically significant differences in expression of cytotoxic T cell (CAT), regulatory T cell (TREG), B-cell (BAT), natural killer cell (NKAT), or endothelial cell-associated transcripts (ENDAT) between the 2 Groups. Our data suggest that exposure to ACEI or ARB was associated with down-regulation of GRIT and CMAT. This anti-inflammatory effect of ACEI or ARB treatment could be an additional benefit in kidney transplant recipients. We identified 29 near normal biopsies with chronic sum allograft injury score (ct+ci+cv) <= 3 for gene expression profiling comparing 2 groups; Group 1 (n=16), patients with no exposure of ACEI or ARB treatment and Group 2 patients (n=13) with exposure to ACEI or ARB at least 6 months prior to kidney biopsy. Biopsies with a diagnosis of acute or chronic rejection, recurrent or de novo glomerular disease, or polyoma nephropathy were excluded.",

The transcription factor ZNF217 is a candidate oncogene in the amplicon on chromosome 20q13 that occurs in 20-30% of primary human breast cancers and that correlates with poor prognosis. We show Znf217 overexpression drives aberrant differentiation and signaling events, promotes increased self-renewal capacity, mesenchymal marker expression, motility and metastasis, and represses an adult tissue stem cell gene signature downregulated in cancers. By in silico screening, we identified candidate therapeutics that at low concentrations inhibit growth of cancer cells expressing high ZNF217. We demonstrate that the nucleoside analog triciribine inhibits ZNF217-induced tumor growth and chemotherapy resistance, and inhibits signaling events (e.g., P-AKT, P-MAPK) in vivo. Our data suggest ZNF217 is a biomarker of poor prognosis and a therapeutic target in breast cancer patients, and triciribine may be part of a personalized treatment strategy in patients overexpressing ZNF217. Since ZNF217 is amplified in numerous cancers, these results have implications for other cancers. Total RNA was isolated from samples overexpressing ZNF217 (3 Primary and 5 SCp2). RNA was also harvested from each cell line expressing a vector control to use as a reference for each microarray sample analyzed. Total RNA was hybridized to mouse MEEBO arrays as described (http://www.microarray.org/sfgf/meebo.do). Samples were verified to have strong overexpression of ZNF217 by qRT-PCR or Western analysis.",

    "text": "Gene expression profiles in systemic sclerosis tenosynovial biopsies. Systemic sclerosis is a connective tissue disease affecting skin and internal organs, characterized by a triad of inflammation, vasculopathy and progressive fibrosis, due to deposition of mainly type I collagen. Out of the intricate mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, evidence indicates that TGFbeta signaling plays a central role in mediating the effects of several pro-fibrotic effectors. In addition, TGFbeta is induced by hypoxia in cultured fibroblasts, an observation suggesting a role for this cytokine in linking vasculopathy and fibrosis in the disease. Not surprisingly, TGFbeta and Wnt signaling are among the most prevalent pathways found in global gene expression studies performed on systemic sclerosis skin biopsies. In this perspective, modulation of TGFbeta activity remains a top therapeutic target in systemic sclerosis drug development.We recently performed whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in systemic sclerosis patients, and evidenced deep connective tissue infiltrates surrounding tendons in patients with active disease, and tendon friction rubs. Tenosynovitis and arthritis were also found by MRI in one third of the patients. We performed tenosynovial biopsies in patients with clinically active tenosynovitis, in order to evaluate whether such samples would provide additional information on disease mechanisms. Here, we report that these samples are characterized by the over-expression of genes involved in fibrosis, TGFbeta/Wnt signaling, chemokines and cytokines, but also by the concurrent over-expression of several ubiquitin-specific peptidases (USPs).Among the USPs overexpressed in systemic sclerosis tenosynovial biopsies, USP15 is known to specifically deubiquitinate SMAD3, and the TGFbeta Receptor 1. These results triggered us to perform additional experiments in order to test whether USP15 overexpression plays a role in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis via decreased ubiquitin-mediated degradation of proteins involved in TGFbeta signaling. Five tenosynovial biopsies were obtained from diffuse systemic sclerosis patients undergoing surgical procedures due to refractory pain and/or loss of function caused by tenosynovitis. These samples were used in high-density transcriptomic and immunohistochemistry experiments.Samples SSc1 to SSc5 are related to this submission. 25 synovial biopsy samples harvested previously by our group in patients with several rheumatic conditions (GSE36700) were used in the normalization procedure.For samples SSc1 to SSc5 , race, age and sex are blinded to preserve patients' confidentiality.",

Normalization for cDNA microarray data: a robust composite method addressing single and multiple slide systematic variation. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Feb 15;30(4):e15.):a) In the 4 h perfusion experiment, the intestines of the paired pups were perfused with 100 mM fructose (HF) and 100 mM glucose (HG) for 4-h, respectively. Totally five replicates were conducted. The RNA samples were extracted from HF- and HG-perfused intestines (n=5 pairs) then labelled with Cy 5 (HF1, HF2, HF3, HF4, and HF5) and Cy 3 (HG1, HG2, HG3, HG4, and HG5), respectively. At the same time, one dye swap experiment, in which the samples extracted from HF- and HG-perfused intestines were labelled with Cy 3 (HF1) and Cy 5 (HG1), respectively, was done and used in the data analysis.b) In the 20 min perfusion experiment, the intestines of of the paired pups were perfused with 100 mM fructose (HF) and 100 mM glucose (HG) for 20-min, respectively. Totally four replicates were conducted. In two of the four-replicate experiments, the samples extracted from HF- and HG-perfused intestines were labelled with Cy 5 (HF1a and HF3a) and Cy 3 (HG1a and HG3a), respectively. In the other two of the four-replicate experiments, the dye was swapped, that is, the samples extracted from HF- and HG-perfused intestines were labelled with Cy 3 (HF2a and HF4a) and Cy 5 (HG2a and HG4a), respectively.c) Three self-self experiments using different samples (HF1, HG1, and HF2) and one capture primer alone experiment were conducted to eliminate the false positive genes and aid to analyze the data.7) The goal of the experiment: Fructose induced the expression of GLUT5 mRNA in the small intestinal epithelial cells. But it is not clear about the mechanisms involved in the phenomenal. In this experiment, we hypothesize: the expression of some genes must be changed after fructose perfusion for 4-h, these genes may regulate GLUT5 gene transcription; the expression of some genes must be changed even after 20-min fructose perfusion, these genes may trigger the GLUT5 gene expression as early response gene. Our goal in this study is to find out these potencial gene.8) Links (URL), citations 2. Samples used, extract preparation, labeling and hybridization 1) Bio-source propertiesa) Sprague Dawley rats (NCBI taxonomy);b) The rat was anesthetized using urathene. The rat body was kept at 37 oC under light.c) Descriptors relevant to the particular sample: the jejunum of the 20-d old rat pups (unknown sex) was perused.2) Biomaterial manipulations: the jejunum was in vivo perfused with 100 mM HF or HG for 4-h or 20-min. At the end of each experiment, the jejunum was immediately cut out and snap frozen in liqued nitrogen, and then stored the tissue in -80 oC freezer.3) RNA isolation: A RNeasy Midi Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) was used to extract total RNA from the jejunum. The brief procesure is described in the Total RNA Extraction for RT-PCR and Microarray above.4) Sample assignment to slides for labeling and hybridization:S1: HF1(Cy 5) vs HG1 (Cy 3); S2: HF2 (Cy 5) vs HG2 (Cy 3); S3: HF3 (Cy 5) vs HG3 (Cy 3); S4: HF4 (Cy 5) vs HG4 (Cy 3); S5: HF5 (Cy 5) vs HG5 (Cy 3); S6: HF2 (Cy 3) vs HG2 (Cy 5); S7: HF1a (Cy 5) vs HG1a (Cy 3); S8: HF3a (Cy 5) vs HG3a (Cy 3); S9: HF2a (Cy 3) vs HG2a (Cy 5); S10: HF4a (Cy 3) vs HG4a (Cy 5); S11: HG1 (Cy 5) vs HG1 (Cy 3); S12: HG3 (Cy 5) vs HG3 (Cy 3); S13: HF3 (Cy 5) vs HF3 (Cy 3); S14: Cy 3 vs Cy 5 capture primer.5) Labeling and hybridization procedures and parameters:The 3DNA Submicro Oligo Expression Array Detection Kit (Genisphere Inc., Hatfield, PA) was employed to synthesize and label the complimentary DNA (cDNA) with fluorescent dye: Cy3 or Cy5. The reason why this indirect labeling method was chosen is based on a previous study which demonstrated that the method was more sensitive and consistent than direct labeling method or other indirect techniques like aminoallyl labeling method and MICROMAX tyramide signal amplification labeling method. (18)Yu J, Othman MI, Farjo R, et al: Molecular Vision 2002; 8:130-137). In the primary experiments, three, four, and five g of total RNA were tested for labeling and hybridization conditions. In the official experiments, four g of total RNA isolated from each sample were used for labeling and hybridization, because the signal to noise ratio is high at this concentration. In addition, at this concentration, all most of the low expressed genes are detectable and the highly expressed genes are not fully saturated. The procedure was conducted following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the first strand cDNA was synthesized using a specific poly T Cy3 RT primer or a specific poly T Cy5 RT primer in different tubes for paired samples. Combine the Cy3 and Cy5 reactions in one tube and precipitate the sample in ethanol. After briefly drying the pellet, resuspend the pellet with 40 l of hybridization buffer. Subsequently, apply the hybridization mixture onto the array slide and hybridize overnight at 55 oC in a humidified chamber. Following the hybridization, the slides were washed by placing them into 50 ml conical tubes containing 2 x SSC, 0.2% SDS for 15 min, 2 x SSC for 10 min, 0.2 x SSC for 10 min, and 95% ethanol for 1 min all at room temperature, except for the first wash, in which the temperature was 42 oC. After drying the slides, the Cy3 and Cy5 capture (connected to dye molecues) reagents mixed in hybridization buffer was pipeted onto the slides, and then hybridize at 65 oC for 3 h following slides wash as described above. 3. Measurement data and spesifications of data processing 1) Raw data descriptionSlides were scanned for Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence using an Axon GenePix4000 microarray reader (GenePix 4000A, Axon instruments, Foster City, CA) and quantitated using GenePix software. Scan parameters: Scan power: Cy 3 : Cy 5 = 100:100; Laser power: Cy 3 : Cy 5 = 1.15:1.76; Spatial resolution: ???; Pixel size: 10 or 100 ???; Pixel number: F pixels: 50-100; B pixels: 400-500 ???; PMT voltage: 600-750 for Cy 5 channel, 650-850 for Cy 3 channel. 2) Image analysis and quantitationFor the image analysis, the density of the spots was detected using Gene Spring (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA) software (GeniPix 4.0) (19) Axon Instruments Inc. (1999) GenePix 4000A User's Guide. Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). It is commercially available. Description of the algorithm and all the parameters used: R = red channel signal = F635; G = green channel signal = B 532; M = log2(R/G); A = 1/2xlog2(RxG); User-difined parameter f = 40%. For the complete image analysis out put of each image, see the NCBI's GEO database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo). 3) Normalized and summarized data-gene expression data matrixFor the normalization, the following two steps were taken.a) When measuring the density of the spots using Gene Spring software, the ratio of Cy 3 and Cy 5 dyes was adjusted as 1 as a globle normalization for the whole slide.b) For the gene expression analysis, the results (midian of the density of the pixel in one spot was used) were normalized by a LOWESS (locally weighed scatter smoother) software provided by the Center for Applied Genomics, so that the results can be compared among the experiments performed at different times.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Feb 15;30(4):e15.).c) The following rules were made to decide the genes that were significantly changed: 1) Eliminate the genes with high density (over than 2X of background) in the 3DNA capture probe experiments; 2) Eliminate the genes with density lower than 2X of background ( 21) Lee HM, Greeley GH Jr, Englander EW. Age-associated changes in gene expression patterns in the duodenum and colon of rats. Mech Ageing Dev. 2001 Apr 15;122(4):355-71.); 3) Eliminate the genes with change over than 1.5X in dye flip-over experiment; 4) Eliminate the genes with opposite results in one experiments between dye flip-over comparisons; 5) Only the genes significantly changed over 3 in 5 comparisons in 4 h perfusion experiment and over 2 in 4 comparisons in 20 min perfusion experiment were considered as reliable and biologically important.d) The final results discribed in this paper were presented as Means + SE and the frequency of gene changed in the HF-perfused intestine. About the image, raw, and normalized data, and other detailed parameters, please see the gene expression data tables derived from the experiments in the NCBI's GEO database. The design for the dye labeling in this experiments is as the follows: 1) 5 comparisons were conducted in the 4 h-perfused HG vs HF experiment, in which in 3 comparisons, the cDNA samples synthesized from HG- and HF-perfused intestines were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively; and in 2 comparisons, the cDNA samples synthesized from HG- and HF-perfused intestines were labeled with Cy5 and Cy3, respectively. 2) 4 comparisons were conducted in the 20 min-perfused HG vs HF experiment, in which in 2 comparisons, the cDNA samples synthesized from HG- and HF-perfused intestines were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively; and in 2 comparisons, the cDNA samples synthesized from HG- and HF-perfused intestines were labeled with Cy5 and Cy3, respectively. 3) 3 dye flip-over experiments using 1 RNA sample extracted from HF-perfused intestine and 2 samples extracted from HG-perfused intestines were performed to eliminate the false positive results induced by the dye labeling technique or other unsolved problems. 4) 2 experiments only applying 3DNA fluorescent probe, which is connected to complementary capture sequence, were performed to eliminate the false positive genes that were low expressed in the tissue. The procedures for synthesizing the first strand cDNA, labeling the cDNA, hybridizaion, and detecting the signals were performed following the manufacturer's protocols.Keywords: other.",

    "text": "Retinoid X receptor activation during adipogenesis of female mesenchymal stem cells programs a dysfunctional adipocyte. Early life exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) is an emerging risk factor for the development of obesity and diabetes later in life. We previously showed that prenatal exposure to the EDC tributyltin (TBT) results in increased adiposity in the offspring. These effects linger into adulthood and are propagated through successive generations. TBT activates two nuclear receptors, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g (PPARg) and its heterodimeric partner retinoid X receptor (RXR), that promote adipogenesis in vivo and in vitro. We recently employed a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) model to show that TBT promotes adipose lineage commitment by activating RXR, not PPARg. This led us to consider the functional consequences of PPARg versus RXR activation in developing adipocytes.We used a transcriptomal approach to characterize genome-wide differences in MSCs differentiated with the PPARg agonist rosiglitazone (ROSI) or TBT. Pathway analysis suggested functional deficits in TBT-treated cells. We then compared adipocytes differentiated with ROSI, TBT, or a pure RXR agonist IRX4204 (4204). Our data show that RXR activators ('rexinoids', 4204 and TBT) attenuate glucose uptake, blunt expression of the anti-diabetic hormone adiponectin, and fail to down-regulate pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic transcripts as does ROSI. Finally, 4204 and TBT treatment results in an inability to induce markers of adipocyte browning, in part due to sustained interferon signaling. Taken together, these data implicate rexinoids in the development of dysfunctional white adipose tissue that could potentially exacerbate obesity and/or diabetes risk in vivo. These data warrant further screening and characterization of EDCs that activate RXR. We generated RNA-Seq data in MSCs differentiated in the presence of an adipogenic induction cocktail (0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 uM dexamethasone, 5 ug/mL insulin )treated with DMSO (0.1%), rosiglitazone (ROSI, 500 nM), or tributyltin (TBT, 50 nM) for 14 days.

We analyzed the expression signatures of 10 tumor biopsies from children affected by alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) to identify genes correlating to biological features of this tumor. Five of these patients were positive for the PAX3-FKHR fusion gene and five were negative. We used a cDNA platform containing a large majority of probes derived for muscle tissues.The comparison of transcription profiles of tumor samples with normal fetal skeletal muscle identified 171 differentially expressed genes common to all ARMS patients. The functional analysis of altered genes led to the identification of a group of transcripts (BCOR, DDX5, LGALS1, BIN1) that may be relevant for the tumorigenic processes leading a normal muscle cell to become a malignant rhabdomyoblast.The muscle-specific platform was able to distinguish PAX3-FKHR positive and negative ARMS through the expression pattern of a limited number of genes (RAC1, CFL1, CCND1) that might be biologically relevant for the different clinical behavior and aggressiveness of the two ARMS subtypes.

    "text": "Small molecule activation of PKM in cancer cells induces serine auxotrophy. Proliferating tumor cells use aerobic glycolysis to support their high metabolic demands. Paradoxically, increased glycolysis is often accompanied by expression of the lower activity PKM isoform, effectively constraining lower glycolysis. Here, we report the discovery of novel PKM activators with a unique allosteric binding mode. Characterization of how these compounds impact cancer cells revealed an unanticipated link between glucose and amino acid metabolism. PKM activation resulted in a metabolic rewiring of cancer cells manifested by a profound dependency on the non-essential amino acid serine for continued cell proliferation. Induction of serine auxotrophy by PKM activation was accompanied by reduced carbon flow into the serine biosynthetic pathway and increased expression of high affinity serine transporters. These data support the hypothesis that PKM expression confers metabolic flexibility to cancer cells that allows adaptation to nutrient stress.

    "text": "Xenograft model systems of adenoid cystic carcinoma. Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is one of the most common malignancies that arise in the salivary glands, with an incidence of 4.5 per 1,000,000. It can also arise in glandular tissue closely related to salivary glands in the lacrimal gland, nasal passages and tracheobronchial tree, as well as in glands of the breast and vulva. At all of these sites, it is characterized by a distinctive histology of basaloid epithelial cells arranged in cribriform or tubular patterns, usually demonstrating abundant hyaline extracellular matrix secretion and some degree of myoepithelial differentiation. ACC is generally a slow-growing tumor characterized by a protracted clinical course, usually well over 5 years in duration, marked by regional recurrence, distant metastasis and/or spread along peripheral nerves. A recurrent chromosomal translocation, t(6;9)(q23;p21), has been identified in ACC, and recently it has been discovered that in a majority of ACC the MYB gene on chromosome 6 is fused to the 3' terminus of the NFIB gene on chromosome 9, creating a fusion gene product resulting in increased MYB-related transcriptional activation. Recently it has been determined that most cell lines with attribution of ACC derivation are either contaminants of other cell lines or do not have the characteristic MYB-NFIB translocation. Also, there are no animal models of this histologically and genetically defined tumor type.

    "text": "Identification of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis patients by transcriptome-based rule set generation [Jena]. Discrimination of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients from patients with other inflammatory/degenerative joint diseases or healthy individuals purely on the basis of genes differentially expressed in high-throughput data has proven very difficult. Thus, the present study sought to achieve such discrimination by employing a novel unbiased approach using rule-based classifiers. Three multi-center genome-wide transcriptomic data sets (Affymetrix HG- U133 A/B) from a total of 79 individuals, including 20 healthy controls (control group - CG), as well as 26 osteoarthritis (OA) and 33 RA patients, were used to infer rule- based classifiers to discriminate the disease groups. The rules were ranked with respect to Kiendl's statistical relevance index, and the resulting rule set was optimized by pruning. The rule sets were inferred separately from data of one of three centers and applied to the two remaining centers for validation. All rules from the optimized rule sets of all centers were used to analyze their biological relevance applying the software Pathway Studio.The optimized rule sets for the three centers contained a total of 29, 20, and 8 rules (including 10, 8, and 4 rules for 'RA'), respectively. The mean sensitivity for the prediction of RA based on six center-to-center tests was 96% (range 90% to 100%), that for OA 86% (range 40% to 100%). The mean specificity for RA prediction was 94% (range 80% to 100%), that for OA 96% (range 83.3% to 100%). The average overall accuracy of the three different rule-based classifiers was 91% (range 80% to 100%). Unbiased analyses by Pathway Studio of the gene sets obtained by discrimination of RA from OA and CG with rule-based classifiers resulted in the identification of the pathogenetically and/or therapeutically relevant interferon-gamma and GM-CSF pathways. First-time application of rule-based classifiers for the discrimination of RA resulted in high performance, with means for all assessment parameters close to or higher than 90%. In addition, this unbiased, new approach resulted in the identification not only of pathways known to be critical to RA, but also of novel molecules such as serine/threonine kinase 10. Three multi-center genome-wide transcriptomic data sets (Affymetrix HG- U133 A/B) from a total of 79 individuals, including 20 healthy controls (control group - CG), as well as 26 osteoarthritis (OA) and 33 RA patients, were used to infer rule- based classifiers to discriminate the disease groups. The rules were ranked with respect to Kiendl's statistical relevance index, and the resulting rule set was optimized by pruning. The rule sets were inferred separately from data of one of three centers and applied to the two remaining centers for validation. All rules from the optimized rule sets of all centers were used to analyze their biological relevance applying the software Pathway Studio.",

Myocardial infarction (MI) often results in left ventricular (LV) remodeling followed by heart failure (HF). It is of great clinical importance to understand the molecular mechanisms that trigger transition from compensated LV injury to HF and to identify relevant diagnostic biomarkers. In this study, we performed transcriptional profiling of LVs in rats with a wide range of experimentally induced infarct sizes and of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in animals that developed HF.We used microarrays to investigate gene expression in the left ventricle (LV) accompanying myocardial infarction and concomitant heart failure (HF) in a well validated model of post-infarcted heart failure and to evaluate their reflection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Myocardial infarction (MI) was induced in male Wistar rats by ligation of the proximal left coronary artery. The sham-operated group (control group) was subjected to the same protocol, except that the suture was not tied around the proximal left coronary artery. Sham-operated rats (n=6) and rats with small (n=6), moderate (n=6), and large (n=5) MI size were included into the experiment two months after the operation. Then, left ventricules and blood samples were obtained for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Microarrays were used to compare the LV and PBMCs transcriptomes of control and experimental animals. The development of heart failure was estimated by echocardiography and catheterization.",

Purpose: Presence of pelvic lymph node metastases is the main prognostic factor in early stage cervical cancer patients, primarily treated with surgery. Aim of this study was to identify cellular tumor pathways associated with pelvic lymph node metastasis in early stage cervical cancer.Experimental Design: Gene expression profiles (Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0) of 20 patients with negative (N0) and 19 with positive lymph nodes (N+), were compared with gene sets that represent all 285 presently available pathway signatures. Validation immunostaining of tumors of 274 consecutive early stage cervical cancer patients was performed for representatives of the identified pathways.Results: Analysis of 285 pathways resulted in identification of five pathways (TGF-b, NFAT, ALK, BAD, and PAR1) that were dysregulated in the N0, and two pathways (b-catenin and Glycosphingolipid Biosynthesis Neo Lactoseries) in the N+ group. Class comparison analysis revealed that five of 149 genes that were most significantly differentially expressed between N0 and N+ tumors (P<0.001) were involved in b-catenin signaling (TCF4, CTNNAL1, CTNND1/p120, DKK3 and WNT5a). Immunohistochemical validation of two well-known cellular tumor pathways (TGF-b and b-catenin) confirmed that the TGF-b pathway (positivity of Smad4) was related to N0 (OR:0.20, 95%CI:0.06-0.66) and the b-catenin pathway (p120 positivity) to N+ (OR:1.79, 95%CI:1.05-3.05).Conclusions: Our study provides new, validated insights in the molecular mechanism of lymph node metastasis in cervical cancer. Pathway analysis of the microarray expression profile suggested that the TGF-b and p120-associated non-canonical b-catenin pathways are important in pelvic lymph node metastasis in early stage cervical cancer. For the microarray experiment, we selected fresh frozen primary cervical cancer tissue, containing at least 80% tumor cells, of patients with histologically confirmed N0 (n=20) and of patients with N+ (n=19). The N0 and N+ groups were matched for age, FIGO stage and histology (all squamous cell carcinoma).",

We identified a novel homozygous 15q13.3 microdeletion in a young boy with a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe cerebral visual impairment with additional signs of congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB), congenital hypotonia with areflexia, profound intellectual disability, and refractory epilepsy. The mechanisms by which the genes in the deleted region exert their effect are unclear. In this paper we probed the role of downstream effects of the deletions as a contributing mechanism to the molecular basis of the observed phenotype. We analyzed gene expression of lymphoblastoid cells derived from peripheral blood of the proband and his relatives to ascertain the relative effects of the homozygous and heterozygous deletions. The proband with 15q13.3 homozygous deletion and his parents with 15q13.3 heterozygous deletions described in our previous report 15 were evaluated using Affymetrix aCGH-244K arrays (build hg18). The aCGH data were validated by qPCR using primers specific to CHRNA7 as previously described. 15 The extended family and comparison subjects were also screened using the CHRNA7 primers. Immortalized lymphoblastoid lines were created from the proband, his mother, father, a paternal half sister, a paternal half brother, a paternal grandmother and two paternal great uncles. Three lymphoblastoid lines from age- and sex- matched normally developing comparison subjects with normal chromosomes were obtained from the Coriell cell repository [(AG14724 (8 yo), AG14948 (10 yo), AG14980 (9 yo)] were used for gene expression comparison with the proband. The samples from the father, mother and paternal grandmother with heterozygous 15q13.3 deletions were compared to samples from lymphoblastoid cells from adult male and female subjects respectively (normal copy number for 15q13.3 determined by qPCR).",

To investigate the molecular mechanism of Uhrf1 in controlling the self-renewal versus differentiation of FL-HSCs, high-throughput sequencing was performed to analyze the transcriptomes of WT and Uhrf1-deficient FL-HSCs.Consistent with the erythroid-biased differentiation of Uhrf1-deficient FL-HSCs, genes involved in erythrocyte differentiation were significantly enriched in Uhrf1-deficient FL-HSCs according to the Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. We generated gene signatures specific for stemness of HSCs (stem signature) or myeloerythroid progenitors (MEP signature) by subtracting the genes expressed in WT HPC(LK)s from those expressed in WT FL-HSCs or vice versa. Of the stem signature genes, 71.28% showed lower expression and 28.72% showed higher expression in Uhrf1-deficient FL-HSCs compared with WT FL-HSCs. Interestingly, among the MEP signature genes, genes enriched in erythroid differentiation (27.54%) were up-regulated in the absence of Uhrf1, whereas the remaining genes enriched in myeloid-specific genes (72.46%) were suppressed consistent with previous research. Particularly, in comparison to the WT control, Uhrf1-deficient FL-HSCs up-regulated certain erythrocyte differentiation-related genes (e.g., Gata1, Gata2, Gfi1b, Car1, Zfpm1 and Itga2b), most of which were physiologically up-regulated in HPC(LK)s, whereas some genes (Id2, Satb1, Hmga2) that play critical roles in HSC maintenance were down-regulated. These results suggested that Uhrf1 controls the self-renewal versus differentiation of FL-HSCs by suppressing the expression of the erythroid-specific genes and maintaining the expression of HSC stemness genes. FL-HSCs(LSKs) (approximately10,000 cells) were isolated from WT and Uhrf1-/- fetal livers by cell sorting (double sort, purity > 95%).

VAAM stands for an amino acid mixture simulating the composition of Vespa, a hornet larval saliva. We conducted a comparative study on metabolism-regulatory roles of VAAM, casein-simulating amino acid mixture (CAAM), and pure water on murine hepatic and adipose tissue transcriptomes. Mice were orally fed VAAM solution ( 0.675 g/ kg BW = 2% of food-derived amino acids = 0.38% of total food energy/ day), CAAM solution ( 0.675 g / kg BW/ day) or water under ad libitum for five days. Hepatic transcriptome comparison of VAAM, CAAM and water-treated groups revealed a VAAM-specific regulation of the metabolic pathway, i.e., the down-regulation of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, and up-regulation of poly unsaturated fatty acid synthesis and glycogenic amino acids utilization in TCA cycle. Similar transcriptomic analysis of white and brown adipose tissues (WAT and BAT) suggested the up-regulation of phospholipid synthesis in WAT and the negative regulation of cellular processes in BAT.

    "text": "Combinatorial mRNA Regulation by miRNAs and Pumilio proteins [CLIP-seq]. Approximately 1500 RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) profoundly impact mammalian cellular function by controlling distinct sets of transcripts, often using sequence-specific binding to 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) to regulate mRNA stability and translation. Aside from their individual effects, higher-order combinatorial interactions between RBPs on specific mRNAs have been proposed to underpin the regulatory network. To assess the extent of such co-regulatory control, we took a global experimental approach followed by targeted validation to examine interactions between two well-characterized and highly conserved RBPs, Argonaute2 (AGO2) and Pumilio (PUM1 and PUM2). Transcriptome-wide changes in AGO2-mRNA binding upon PUM knockdown were quantified by CLIP-seq, and the presence of PUM binding on the same 3' UTR corresponded with cooperative and antagonistic effects on AGO2 occupancy. In addition, PUM binding sites that overlap with AGO2 showed differential, weakened binding profiles upon abrogation of AGO2 association, indicative of cooperative interactions. In luciferase reporter validation of candidate 3' UTR sites where AGO2 and PUM colocalized, three sites were identified to host antagonistic interactions, where PUM counteracts miRNA-guided repression. Interestingly, the binding sites for the two proteins are too far for potential antagonism due to steric hindrance, suggesting an alternate mechanism. Our data experimentally confirms the combinatorial regulatory model and indicates that the mostly repressive PUM proteins can change their behavior in a context-dependent manner. Overall, the approach underscores the importance of further elucidation of complex interactions between RBPs and their transcriptome-wide extent.

Cachexia is a devastating muscle wasting syndrome that occurs in patients suffering from chronic diseases, most commonly observed in 80% of advanced cancer patients. One of the primary causes of cachexia-associated morbidity and mortality is involuntary muscle wasting. And while many cachexia patients show hypermetabolism, its causative role in muscles had remained unclear. To understand the molecular basis of this muscle wasting, accurate models of cachexia are necessary. Using transcriptomics and cytokine profiling of human muscle stem cell-based models and human cancer-induced cachexia models in mice, we found that cachectic cancer cells secreted many inflammatory factors which rapidly led to higher levels of fatty acid metabolism and the activation of a p38 stress response signature, before the cachectic muscle wasting is manifested. Metabolomics profiling revealed that factors secreted by cachectic cancer cells rapidly induce excessive fatty acid oxidation in human myotubes, leading to oxidative stress, p38 activation, and impaired muscle growth. Pharmacological blockade of fatty acid oxidation not only rescued human myotubes, but also significantly improved muscle mass and total weight in cancer cachexia models in vivo. Therefore, fatty acid-induced oxidative stress could be targeted to prevent cancer cachexia. Three NOD-SCID mice were subcutaneously transplanted with RXF393 or SKRC39 cancer cells for 22 d. Quadriceps muscles were harvested and total RNA was extracted with the Trizol reagent (Ambion) for each mouse, processed with the Total Prep RNA for Illumina kit (Ambion), and hybridized to an Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 beadchip, then scanned on the Illumina Beadarray Reader.

Rotenone is a strong mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I inhibitor. Inhibitors of complex I are suggested to exert anti-tumor activity of those tumors relying on oxidative metabolism and are therefore of interest in oncology research. Nevertheless, the safety profile of these inhibitors needs to be rigorously assessed. Rotenone has shown anti-carcinogenic activity in several studies. In this context we used rotenone in our study as tool compound with the aim to identify suitable biomarker candidates and enhance mechanistic insights into the biologic and cellular effects of complex I inhibitors at the organ level after in vivo treatment. Various parameters, including hematology, clinical chemistry and histopathology, major blood cell population phenotyping using FACS and enzymatic activity assays were measured and/or evaluated. Moreover gene expression profiles were determined to investigate pathways and functions affected by rotenone at the molecular level. As organs, liver, heart and brain stem were chosen due to the high metabolic activity, the high energy demand and due to the known neurotoxic effect of rotenone, respectively. The strongest rotenone-induced effects on gene expression were observed in the liver (1444 deregulated genes) compared to heart (650 deregulated genes) and brain stem (52 deregulated genes).

Thiamine prevents diabetic complications, and its deficiency, resulting from mutation of thiamine transporter gene SLC19A2 has been linked to diabetes mellitus. We previously found that thiamine mitigates metabolic disorders in spontaneous hypertensive rats, harboring defects in glucose and fatty acid metabolism. The current study extends our hypothesis that that thiamine intervention may impact metabolic abnormalities in polyphagia-induced Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats that lack functional cholecystokinin A receptors. Male OLETF rats exhibit progressive obesity and metabolic disorders similar to human metabolic syndrome. Male OLETF rats (4-week-old) were given free access to water containing either 0.2 % or 0 % of thiamine for 51 weeks. At the end of treatment, blood parameters and cardiac functions were analyzed. After sacrifice, the organs were removed and weights of organs and histological findings were evaluated. In addition, differential gene expression in the liver was analyzed. Thiamine intervention averted obesity, mainly resulting from reduction of visceral adiposity, and prevented metabolic disorders in OLETF rats. Histological evaluation revealed that thiamine alleviated adipocyte hypertrophy, steatosis in the liver, heart, and skeletal muscle, interstitial fibrosis in the heart and kidney, fatty degeneration in the pancreas, thickening of the basement membrane of vasculature, and glomerulopathy and mononuclear cell infiltration in the kidney. Cardiac and renal functions were preserved in thiamine treatment. Seventy-six genes showed at least two-fold difference in hepatic expression with thiamine treatment. Several of them participated in carbohydrate metabolism (Hk1, Pygb, Slc2a8, Rtn4, Rhbdl1, and Tspan8), lipid metabolism (Pla2g15, Por, and Lmf1), vascular physiology (S1pr1, Epha8, Rtn4, Slc7a13, Cdh15, Itga9, Cd151, Cd40lg, Nid1 and Lamb1), and carcinogenesis (Lmo7, Fgfr3, and Dmbt1).

This study assessed gene expression changes associated with inflammation in the colon tissue of multi-drug resistance targeted mutation (Mdr1a-/-) mice, a model of human IBD. It also tested the anti-inflammatory potential of curcumin in the colon of these mice with a particular focus on the proteome.A colonic histological injury score was determined for each mouse to assess the level of colon inflammation in Mdr1a-/- mice, and to establish the effect of curcumin on inflammation. Insights into mechanisms of colonic inflammation in the Mdr1a-/- mice were gained using transcriptome (microarray) and proteome (2-D gel electrophoresis and LCMS protein identification) analyses. These data were compared to changes in the colon proteome in response to curcumin, and to previously described transcriptomic analyses [Nones et al, PMID: 18761777; GSE10684] in response to curcumin, in this model. A total of 24 male Mdr1a-/- mice, and 24 male FVB/N mice, purchased from Taconic (Hudson, NY, USA) at 4-5 weeks of age, were used for this study. 12 mice were randomly assigned to each of two different dietary groups: control (AIN-76A powdered diet), or curcumin (AIN-76A + 0.2% curcumin). At 21 and 24 weeks of age, mice were euthanized and colon samples taken for histological, microarray, and proteomics analyses. The total histology score (HIS) in the colon was determined according to previously described criteria. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol(r) reagent. Colon RNA from four Mdr1a-/- mice (with high HIS) on the control diet (i.e. AIN-76A powdered diet) was compared with colon RNA from four FVB/N mice with low HIS also on the control diet (i.e. AIN-76A powdered diet).

Hereby, we examined the metabolic consequences of PARP-2 ablation in liver. Microarray analysis of PARP-2 knockdown HepG2 cells revealed the dysregulation of lipid and cholesterol metabolism genes. Induction of cholesterol biosynthesis genes stemmed from the enhanced expression of sterol-regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1. We revealed that PARP-2 is a suppressor of the SREBP-1 promoter, therefore ablation of PARP-2 induces SREBP-1 expression and consequently cholesterol synthesis. PARP-2-/- mice had higher SREBP-1 expression that was translated into enhanced hepatic and serum cholesterol levels. PARP-2 silencing was performed employing shPARP-2 (small hairpin) and scPARP-2 (scrambled) shRNA by lentiviral delivery (Sigma) using 40 MOI lentiviruses coding shRNA sequence against PARP-2.",

To fully comprehend how genetic variants influence phenotypes, we must understand the functions of the epigenome. To assess the degree to which genetic variants influence epigenome activity, we integrate epigenetic and genotypic data from lupus patient lymphoblastoid cell lines to identify variants that induce allelic imbalance in the magnitude of histone post-translational modifications, referred to herein as histone quantitative trait loci (hQTLs). We demonstrate that enhancer hQTLs are enriched on autoimmune disease risk haplotypes and disproportionately influence gene expression variability compared with non-hQTL variants in strong linkage disequilibrium. We show that the epigenome regulates HLA class II genes differently in individuals who carry HLA-DR3 or HLA-DR15 haplotypes, resulting in differential 3D chromatin conformation and gene expression.

Sweat glands play a fundamental role in thermal regulation in man, but the molecular mechanism of their development remains unknown. To initiate analyses, we compared the model of Eda mutant Tabby mice, in which sweat glands were not formed, to wild-type mice. We inferred developmental stages and critical genes based on observations at 7 time points spanning embryonic, postnatal and adult life. In wild-type footpads, sweat gland germs were detected at E17.5. The coiling of secretory portions started at postnatal day 1 (P1), and sweat gland formation was essentially complete by P5. Consistent with a controlled morphological progression, expression profiling revealed stage-specific gene expression changes. Similar to the development of hair follicles the other major skin appendage controlled by EDA sweat gland induction and initial progression was accompanied by Eda-dependent up-regulation of the Shh pathway. During the further development of sweat gland secretory portions, Foxa1 and Foxi1, not at all expressed in hair follicles, were progressively up-regulated in wild-type but not in Tabby footpads. Upon completion of wild-type development, Shh declined to Tabby levels, but Fox family genes remained at elevated levels in mature sweat glands. The results provide a framework for the further analysis of phased downstream regulation of gene action, possibly by a signaling cascade, in response to Eda.This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a widely used technique for identifying transcription factor (TF) binding events throughout an entire genome. However, ChIP-seq is limited by the availability of suitable ChIP-seq grade antibodies, and the vast majority of commercially available antibodies fail to generate usable datasets. To ameliorate these technical obstacles, we present a robust methodological approach for performing ChIP-seq through epitope tagging of endogenous TFs. We used Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-based genome editing technology to develop CRISPR Epitope Tagging ChIP-seq (CETCh-seq) of DNA-binding proteins. We assessed the feasibility of CETCh-seq by tagging several TFs spanning a wide range of endogenous expression levels in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. Our data exhibit strong correlations between both replicate types as well as with standard ChIP-seq approaches that use TF antibodies. Notably, we also observed minimal changes to the cellular transcriptome and to the expression of the tagged TF. To examine the robustness of our technique, we further performed CETCh-seq in the breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF7 as well as mouse embryonic stem cells and observed similarly high correlations. Collectively, these data highlight the applicability of CETCh-seq to accurately define the genome-wide binding profiles of DNA-binding proteins, allowing for a straightforward methodology to potentially assay the complete repertoire of TFs, including the large fraction for which ChIPquality antibodies are not available.

Changes in gene expression that occur across the entire central nervous system (CNS) during disease do not take into account variability from one CNS region to another and can be confounded by alterations in cellular composition during disease. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by cell proliferation, migration and damage in various cell types in different CNS regions and causes disabilities related to distinct neurological pathways, such as walking, vision and cognition. Here, a cell-specific and region-specific transcriptomic approach was used to determine changes in gene expression in astrocytes derived from spinal cord, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus in the preclinical MS model, chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis showed that changes in gene expression pathways in astrocytes differed between neuroanatomic regions. Further, while astrocytes from spinal cord showed increased expression of immune pathway genes during EAE, cholesterol biosynthesis pathway genes were decreased. Translating these findings from the preclinical model to humans, optic nerve from EAE and optic chiasm from MS each showed a significant decrease in cholesterol biosynthesis pathways. Finally, a treatment targeting cholesterol homeostasis in astrocytes was protective in EAE, suggesting a novel neuroprotective strategy for MS. Using a cell-specific and region-specific gene expression approach can provide therapeutically relevant insights into mechanisms underlying specific disabilities in complex multifocal neurological diseases.

In addition to its role in translation termination, eRF3 has been implicated in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway through its interaction with Upf1. NMD is a RNA quality control mechanism, which detects and degrades aberrant mRNAs as well as some normal transcripts including those that harbor upstream open reading frames in their 5' leader sequence and long 3' UTR. In this study, we used RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to perform a genome wide analysis of the effect of either eRF3 or Upf1 depletion in human cells. Our bioinformatics analyses allow to delineate the features of the transcripts controlled by eRF3 and Upf1 and to compare the effect of each of these factors on gene expression. We show that eRF3 and Upf1 have very different impact on the human transcriptome, only ~250 transcripts being targeted by both factors. We also show that in contrast to Upf1, eRF3a depletion globally derepressed the expression of mRNAs containing translated uORFs. Finally, we find that eRF3a and Upf1 have opposite effects on ribosome protein gene expression.

    "text": "Transcriptome analysis of human OXR1 depleted cells reveals its role in regulating the p53 signaling pathway. Purpose: The oxidation resistance gene 1 (OXR1) is crucial for protecting against oxidative stress, limiting neurodegeneration and maintaining normal lifespan in eukaryotes. However, the molecular function of OXR1 is still unknown. Previously we showed that human OXR1 regulates expression of antioxidant genes GPX2 and HO-1 via the p21 signaling pathway. To examine the role of hOXR1 in global transcription regulation during cellular stress, we employed RNA sequencing to investigate the transcription profile in hOXR1 depleted HeLa cells.Methods: Control siRNA (siCon) and human OXR1 siRNA (siOXR1) transfected HeLa cells were either harvested directly (siCon_NT, siOXR1_NT) or exposed to 0.5 mM H2O2 for 1 h and then harvested immediately without recovery (siCon_R0h, siOXR1_R0h). Total RNA pooled from duplicate samples was used for RNA sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at gene level. The Blast2GO program was used to generate gene ontology (GO) annotation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs).The WEGO software was used to further perform GO functional classification and to predict pathways affected. qRT-PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays.Results: In total, in non-treated and hydrogen peroxide exposed cells, hOXR1 depletion results in the down-regulation of 554 genes and the up-regulation of 253 genes. These differentially expressed genes include transcription factors (i.e. HIF1A, SP6, E2F8 and TCF3) and numerous genes of the p53 signaling pathway involved in cell-cycle arrest (i.e. cyclin D, CDK6 and p21) and apoptosis (i.e. CytC and CASP9). Western blot analysis reveals that hOXR1 suppresses CASP9 protein expression and reduces post-translational cleavage into its active form. After exposure to hydrogen peroxide (1 h), 56 early response genes were up-regulated in hOXR1 depleted cells, in which 38 of these genes were not induced in control cells. In addition, a subset of the commonly up-regulated early response genes showed a stronger induction in hOXR1 depleted cells (i.e. FOS, JUN and DUSP1). Out of a total of 52 differentially expressed transcription factors in hOXR1 depleted cells under normal physiology and oxidative stress condition, 14 genes (including HIF1A, STAT5A, E2F8 and TCF3) are differentially regulated under H2O2 treatment in hOXR1 silenced cells as compared to control cells. Finally, we demonstrate that hOXR1 depleted cells undergo cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase during oxidative stress.Conclusions: Human OXR1 is important for regulation of the early stress response to oxidative stress in HeLa cells. HOXR1 modulates the p53 signaling pathway via regulation of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and anti-oxidation. Further, hOXR1 regulates numerous transcription factors of importance for cellular stress responses. In summary, hOXR1 may act as a sensor of cellular oxidative stress to regulate the transcriptional networks required to detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulate cell cycle arrest and cell death (apoptosis). The mRNA profiles of hOXR1 depleted and control Hela cells with or without H2O2 treatment 1 h were generated by RNA sequencing using Illumina Hiseq 2000.",

To systemically elucidate the role of the GI tract in obesity, we performed a transcriptomic analyses in different parts of the GI tract of two obese mouse models: ob/ob and high-fat diet (HFD) fed mice. Compared to their lean controls, both obese mouse groups had significant amount of gene expression changes in the stomach (ob/ob: 959; HFD: 542), much more than the number of changes in the intestine. Despite the difference in genetic background, the two mouse models shared 296 similar gene expression changes in the stomach. Among those genes, some had known associations to obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance. In addition, the gene expression profile strongly suggested an increased gastric acid secretion in both obese mouse models, probably through an activation of the gastrin pathway. In conclusion, our data reveal a previously unknown dominant connection between the stomach and obesity.

Different studies investigated genomic alterations in cervical cancer mainly by means of metaphase comparative genomic hybridization (mCGH) and microsatellite marker analysis for the detection of loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Currently, high throughput methods such as array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH), single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP array) and gene expression arrays are available to study genome-wide alterations. Integration of these 3 platforms allows detection of genomic alterations at high resolution and investigation of an association between copy number changes and expression. RESULTS: Genome-wide copy number and genotype analysis of 10 cervical cancer cell lines by array CGH and SNP array showed highly complex large-scale alterations. A comparison between array CGH and SNP array revealed that the overall concordance in detection of the same areas with copy number alterations (CNA) was above 90%. The use of SNP arrays demonstrated that about 75% of LOH events would not have been found by methods which screen for copy number changes, such as array CGH, since these were LOH events without CNA. Regions frequently targeted by CNA, as determined by array CGH, such as amplification of 5p and 20q, and loss of 8p were confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Genome-wide, we did not find a correlation between copy-number and gene expression. At chromosome arm 5p however, 22% of the genes were significantly upregulated in cell lines with amplifications as compared to cell lines without amplifications, as measured by gene expression arrays. For 3 genes, SKP2, ANKH and TRIO, expression differences were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). CONCLUSION: This study showed that copy number data retrieved from either array CGH or SNP array are comparable and that the integration of genome-wide LOH, copy number and gene expression is useful for the identification of gene specific targets that could be relevant for the development and progression in cervical cancer.Keywords: DNA copynumber RNA expression correlation.

Extraocular muscles (EOMs) are a highly specialized type of tissue with a wide range of unique properties, including characteristic innervation, development, and structural proteins. Even though EOMs are frequently and prominently involved in thyroid-associated diseases, little is known about the immediate effects of thyroid hormone on these muscles. In order to create a comprehensive profile of changes in gene expression levels in EOMs induced by thyroid hormone, hyperthyroid conditions were simulated by treating adult Sprague-Dawley rats with intraperitoneal injections of 25 mg T3 per 100 g body weight over the course of six weeks; subsequently, microarray analysis was used to determine changes in mRNA levels in EOMs from T3-treated animals relative to untreated controls.RNA isolated from tibialis anterior muscles of the same animals was used as a reference fast-twitch muscle. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats (initial body weight 200 +- 40 g) were fed ad libitum with standard laboratory diet and tap water. Eight rats were randomly divided into a T3-treated and a control group, three males and one female each.To simulate a chronically hyperthyroid state, T3 treatment was administered by intraperitoneal injections of 25 ug T3 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) per 100 g body weight. Injections were administered every second day over a period of six weeks. 24 hours after the last injection, the animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, muscles were dissected immediately after death.Each of the four biological replicates in each group was used for a single microarray each.RNA from EOMs was used.

Separate populations of M cells have been detected in the follicle-associated epithelium of Peyer's patches (PPs) and the villous epithelium of the small intestine, but the traits shared by or distinguishing the two populations have not been characterized. Our separate study has demonstrated that M cells are rare but M-like cells positive for lectin Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1 and our newly developed M cell-specific mAb NKM16-2-4 are induced by oral administration of cholera toxin in the duodenal villous epithelium. Here, we determined the gene expression of PP M cells, villous M-like cells, and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) isolated by a novel approach using FACS. Specific expression of glycoprotein 2 (GP2) and MARCKS-like protein (MLP) by PP M cells and not villous M-like cells was confirmed by additional mRNA and protein analyses. Comprehensive gene profiling also suggested that villous M-like cells share traits of both PP M cells and IECs, a finding that is supported by their unique expression of specific chemokines. The genome-wide assessment of gene expression facilitates discovery of M cell-specific molecules and enhances the molecular understanding of M cell immunobiology.Keywords: Cell type comparison.

    "text": "Excluding Oct4 from Yamanaka cocktail unleashes the developmental potential of iPSCs. Oct4 is widely considered the most important among the four Yamanaka reprogramming factors. Here we show that the combination of Sox2, Klf4, and cMyc (SKM) suffices for reprogramming mouse somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Simultaneous induction of Sox2 and cMyc in fibroblasts triggers immediate retroviral silencing, which explains the discrepancy with previous studies that attempted but failed to generate iPSCs without Oct4 using retroviral vectors. SKM induction could partially activate the pluripotency network even in Oct4-knockout fibroblasts. Importantly, reprogramming in the absence of exogenous Oct4 results in greatly improved developmental potential of iPSCs, determined by their ability to give rise to all-iPSC mice in the tetraploid complementation assay. Our data suggest that overexpression of Oct4 during reprogramming leads to off-target gene activation during reprogramming and epigenetic aberrations in resulting iPSCs, and thereby bear major implications for further development and application of iPSC technology. To gain deeper insight into the mechanism of SKM reprogramming, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) over the course of reprogramming under both SKM and OSKM conditions (Figure 4E). The pMX mCherry+ OG2 MEFs were transduced with polycistronic reprogramming vectors. Samples were collected after 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 days of dox induction and used for total RNA isolation and sequencing. Only mCherry- cells were used for RNA isolation to reduce heterogeneity and to eliminate contamination by untransduced cells. Additionally, we sequenced subpopulations of reprogramming intermediates that underwent mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) on day 6 (mCherry-/GFP-/Epcam+) or activated endogenous Oct4 (mCherry-/GFP+) on days 9 and 12 (2 days after dox withdrawal) (Figure S4E).We also compared the gene expression in all OSKM and SKM iPSC lines tested in 4N complementation assays, including those generated by episomal method, as well as ESC lines--altogether 23 lines.To track the developmental fate of 4N-off OSKM iPSCs, we marked three high quality and four low quality lines (both tet-inducible and episomal) with constitutive mCherry expression. We used these lines to generate 4N-aggregates and examined the embryos at E9.5. At this stage all the tested lines could generate viable embryos with no obvious phenotype (Figure 7D) and the vast majority of the cells are derived from iPSCs (Figure S7E).

Little is known about the role of PPARa in the small intestine. Since this organ is frequently exposed to high levels of PPARa ligands via the diet, we set out to characterize the function of PPARa in small intestine using functional genomics experiments and bioinformatics tools. PPARa was expressed at high levels in both human and murine small intestine. Detailed analyses showed that PPARa was expressed highest in villus cells of proximal jejunum. Microarray analyses of total tissue samples revealed, that in addition to genes involved in fatty acid and triacylglycerol metabolism, transcription factors and enzymes connected to sterol and bile acid metabolism, including FXR and SREBP1, were specifically induced. In contrast, genes involved in cell cycle and differentiation, apoptosis, and host defense were repressed by PPARa activation. Additional analyses showed that intestinal PPARa dependent gene regulation occurred in villus cells. Functional implications of array results were corroborated by morphometric data. The repression of genes involved in proliferation and apoptosis was accompanied by a 22% increase in villus height, and a 34% increase in villus area of wild-type animals treated with WY14643.

Three major MAP kinase signaling cascades, ERK, p38 and JNK, play significant roles in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure in response to external stress and neural/hormonal stimuli. In order to study the specific function of each MAP kinase branch in adult heart, we have generated three transgenic mouse models with cardiac specific and temporally regulated expression of activated mutants of Ras, MKK3 and MKK7, which are selective upstream activators for ERK, p38 and JNK, respectively. Gene expression profiles in transgenic adult hearts were determined using cDNA microarrays at both early (4-7 days) and late (2-4 weeks) time points following transgene induction. From this study, we revealed common changes in gene expression among the three models, particularly involving extracellular matrix remodeling. However, distinct expression patterns characteristic for each pathway were also identified in cell signaling, growth and physiology. In addition, genes with dynamic expression differences between early vs. late stages illustrated primary vs. secondary changes upon MAP kinase activation in adult hearts.

    "text": "Wide-scale transcriptome disturbance underlies liver and kidney pathology from chronic ultra low dose Roundup exposure [kidney]. Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH) are the major pesticides used worldwide. Converging evidence suggests that GBH residues pose a particular risk to the kidneys and liver. However, the existence of biological effects with negative health implications at low environmentally relevant doses remains unresolved. A previous investigation addressed this issue, by conducting a 2-year feeding study, which included 10 female Sprague Dawley rats administered via drinking water with 0.1 ppb of a major Roundup formulation (50 ng/L glyphosate equivalent dilution). Hepatorenal toxicities, as well as urine and blood biochemistry disturbances at the 15th month of age were observed. In an effort to obtain molecular mechanistic insight into the underlying causes of these pathologies, we have carried out a transcriptome microarray analysis of the liver and kidneys from these same animals. The expression of 4224 and 4447 genes were found to be disturbed respectively in liver and kidney (p<0.01, q<0.08, fold change >1.1). Among the 1319 genes whose expression was altered in both tissues, 3 functional categories were over-represented. First, genes involved in mRNA splicing and small nucleolar RNA were mostly upregulated, suggesting disruption of normal spliceosome activity. Electron microscopic analysis of hepatocytes confirmed nucleolar structural disruption. Second, genes controlling chromatin structure (especially histone-lysine N-methyltransferases) were mostly upregulated. Third, genes related to respiratory chain complex I and the tricarboxylic acid cycle were mostly downregulated. The transcription factor networks that can account for these disruptions were centered on CREB1, ESR1, YY1, c-Myc and Oct3/4 activity, which are known to closely cooperate in the regulation of gene expression after hormonal stimulation. The analysis of pathways and toxicity processes showed that these disturbances in gene expression were representative of fibrosis, necrosis, phospholipidosis, mitochondrial membrane dysfunction and ischemia, which correlate with the pathologies observed at an anatomical and histological level. Our results suggest that new studies incorporating testing principles from endocrinology and developmental epigenetics need to be performed to investigate potential consequences of exposure to low dose, environmental levels of GBH and glyphosate. Nine female rats were fed drinking water containing 0.1ppb Roundup formulation (50 ng/L glyphosate equivalent dilution). Ten control female rats were fed untreated drinking water.

MiR-22 plays important roles in nCB induced experimental emphysema through regulating APC activation. Results provide insight into the biological role and target genes of miR-22.Smoking-related emphysema is a chronic inflammatory disease driven by T helper 17 (TH17) cells through molecular mechanisms that remain obscure. Here we have explored the role of microRNA-22 (miR-22) in emphysema. MiR-22 was upregulated in lung myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) of smokers with emphysema and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) of mice exposed to smoke or nanoparticulate carbon black (nCB) through a mechanism involving NF-kappaB. MiR-22-deficient mice, but not wild-type, showed attenuated TH17 responses and failed to develop emphysema after exposure to either smoke or nCB. We further show that miR-22 controls APC activation and TH17 responses through activation of AP-1 transcription factor complexes and histone deacetylase (HDAC) 4. Thus, miR-22 is a critical regulator of both emphysema and TH17 responses. Lung APCs were isolated from PBS (reference groups) or nCB exposed wildtype or Mir22-/- mice, total four groups.

Deletions within the human IKZF1 gene, which encodes Ikaros, a zinc finger transcription factor critical for lymphopoiesis, appear to be the most prominent recurring lesion in human BCR-ABL1+ (Ph+) B-ALL. Furthermore, IKZF1 mutations correlate with poor prognosis of progenitor B-ALL, further strengthening the notion that IKZF1 is a critical tumor suppressor gene in human B-lineage malignancies. To better understand the relationship between Ikzf1 mutations, BCR-ABL, and B-lineage leukemia, we examined the effect of two newly generated Ikzf1 germline mutation on BCR-ABL-induced proliferation and leukemogenesis in vitro and in vivo. We recently showed that deletion of either the exon encoding the first or the fourth DNA-binding zinc finger of Ikaros (IkZnF1-/- and IkZnF4-/-) led to distinct defects in lymphoid development and tumor suppression with de-regulation of distinct subsets of genes, providing a powerful tool for elucidation of Ikaros target genes and mechanism of function. Importantly, IkZnF4-/- had lost Ikaros tumor suppression function, while not abolishing B-cell development. Retroviral expression of BCR-ABL1 p185 in bone marrow cells from the two Ikzf1 mutant strains demonstrated that loss of ZnF4 resulted in expansion of progenitor B cells, with enhanced proliferation in vitro and a less mature cell surface B-cell phenotype in comparison to transduced wild-type bone marrow. Furthermore, in an in vivo model of BCR-ABL+ B-ALL, leukemias generated in the IkZnF4-/- background were more aggressive than those observed in a wild-type background, with cell phenotype corresponding to the in vitro cell cultures. Genome wide high throughput expression analysis (RNA-Seq) revealed a distinct subset of deregulated genes in the IkZnF4-/- BCR-ABL+ in vitro cell cultures, and molecular analysis demonstrated that this in vitro system is amendable for functional studies. These results establish a mouse model for studying the role of Ikzf1 mutations in B-ALL, and for understanding how BCR-ABL collaborates with Ikzf1 mutations to generate aggressive B-ALL.

Of concern, therapeutic interventions shown to significantly dampen or even reverse disease in mouse models have not successfully translated into interventions in human T1D. The present study addresses this disconnect in research translation by directly analyzing human donor islets from individuals with T1D, aiming to provide insight into disease mechanisms and identify potential target pathways for therapeutic intervention. We obtained human islets from a young individual with short-duration T1D, an older individual with long-duration T1D and three non-diabetic donors, and performed unbiased functional genomic analysis by high depth RNA sequencing on these unique cases. This analysis identified several inflammatory pathways upregulated in short-duration disease, which surprisingly included many components of innate immunity. Subsequent manipulation of one of these pathways/factors in NOD mice resulted in a significant reduction in diabetes progression when inhibition occurred early in disease progression.

The analysis of RNA-Seq data presents novel challenges and many methods have been developed for the purpose of mapping reads to genomic features and quantifying gene expression. The main goal of this work was to identify, characterize and catalogue all the transcripts expressed within cardiac tissue and to quantify the differential expression of transcripts in both physio- and pathological conditions through whole transcriptome analyses. Expression levels, differential splicing, allele-specific expression, RNA editing and fusion transcripts constitute important information when comparing samples for disease related studies.

Ischemia-reperfusion injury during liver transplantation is responsible for early allograft dysfunction (EAD) and failure, both of which are associated with a high risk of morbidity and mortality in the recipient. The purpose of this study was to study major transcriptional alterations in livers procured from different types of human liver donors in order to identify genetic profiles predictive of post-implantation function. We have analyzed samples form living donors (LD), donors after cardiac death (DCD), donors after brain death, with subsequent post-implantation EAD in the recipient (DBD-EAD); and donors after brain death without EAD (DBD). Two samples were obtained from each donor: sample A was taken immediately before cold perfusion (baseline) and sample B 2h after portal reperfusion. We identified clear differences in gene expression patterns according to donor source. Both samples A and B from DBD-EAD and DCD demonstrated over-expression of pro-apoptotic and inflammatory transcripts. However, in DBD and LD, expression of these genes was low at baseline and rose only after reperfusion. DBD and LD demonstrated the greatest increase in overall genetic expression after reperfusion when sample B was contrasted with A, indicating less baseline graft injury in these two groups. Grafts from LD were characterized by activation of transcripts related to anti-ischemic and regenerative processes and fewer pro-inflammatory gene transcripts. This transcriptional events occurring in liver allografts could allow for the prediction of post-transplant function. Pro-inflammatory and ischemic transcriptional changes in the grafts are directly related to donor type and may be useful targets for the development of future therapeutic strategies. The complete database comprised the expression for samples taken from 33 liver grafts. Sample A was taken immediately before cold perfusion (baseline) and sample B 2 h after portal reperfusion. Donors were from one of four groups: living (LD); after cardiac death (DCD); after brain death, with subsequent post-implantation EAD in the recipient (DBD-EAD); and after brain death without EAD (DBD). RNA was extracted from the 66 samples and analyzed using Illumina Beadarray technology.

The zinc finger transcription factor GATA1 plays an essential role for differentiation in several hematopoietic cell lineages including erythroid cells, megakaryocytes and eosinophils. Although some studies demonstrated that GATA1 is also required for mast cell differentiation, the effect of complete ablation of GATA1 in mast cell differentiation has not been examined. Here, by using tamoxifen-inducible conditional Gata1 knockout mice, we show that the role of GATA1 in mast cell differentiation is less than previously anticipated in adult mice. Although systemic administration of tamoxifen resulted in complete ablation of GATA1 protein in bone marrow and spleen, cell number and distribution of peripheral tissue mast cells in Gata1-null mice were comparable to those in wild type mice. Bone marrow cells derived from Gata1-null mice differentiated into mast cells that express both c-Kit and IgE receptor a subunit. Finally, we show a line of evidence that GATA1 and GATA2 cooperatively regulate the expression of several mast cell-specific genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and quantitative RT-PCR analyses. These results indicate that GATA1 is dispensable for differentiation and maintenance of mast cells in postnatal hematopoiesis and the loss of GATA1 function is likely compensated by GATA2. Murine bone marrow-derived mast cells from C57BL/6 mice were transfected with of control or GATA1 siRNA (200 pmol). Two samples were analyzed.

However, therapeutic targeting of c-Myc has remained elusive due to its lack of a clear ligand-binding domain. We therefore targeted c-Myc transcriptional function by another means, namely the disruption of chromatin-dependent signal transduction. Members of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) subfamily of human bromodomain proteins (BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4) associate with acetylated chromatin and facilitate transcriptional activation by increasing the effective molarity of recruited transcriptional activators. Notably, BRD4 marks select M/G1 genes in mitotic chromatin for transcriptional memory and direct post-mitotic transcription, via direct interaction with the positive transcription elongation factor complex b (P-TEFb). Because c-Myc is known to regulate promoter-proximal pause release of Pol II, also through the recruitment of P-TEFb, we evaluated the selective small-molecule inhibitor of BET bromodomains, JQ1, as a chemical probe to interrogate the role of BET bromodomains in Myc-dependent transcription and to explore their role as therapeutic targets in c-Myc-driven neoplasias.

Cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) represents nearly 50% of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases with a 5-year overall survival of approximately 30%. In CN-AML with poorer prognosis, mutations in the de novo DNA methyltransferase (DNMT3A) and the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) commonly co-occur (1-3). We demonstrate that mice with Flt3-internal-tandem duplication (Flt3ITD) and inducible deletion of Dnmt3a spontaneously develop a rapidly-lethal, completely-penetrant, and transplantable AML of normal karyotype. These murine AML retain a single Dnmt3a floxed allele, revealing the oncogenic potential of Dnmt3a haploinsufficiency. FLT3-ITD/DNMT3A-mutant primary human and murine AML demonstrate a similar pattern of global DNA methylation. In the murine model, rescuing DNMT3A expression was accompanied by DNA re-methylation and loss of clonogenic potential, suggesting that Dnmt3a-mutant oncogenic effects are reversible. Differentially methylated genomic regions were associated with changes in the expression of nearby genes. Moreover, dissection of the cellular architecture of the AML model using single-cell RNA-Seq, flow cytometry and colony assays identified clonogenic subpopulations that differentially express genes that are sensitive to the methylation of nearby genomic loci and varied in response to Dnmt3a levels. Thus, Dnmt3a haploinsufficiency transforms Flt3ITD myeloproliferative disease by modulating methylation-sensitive gene expression within a clonogenic AML subpopulation.

Lhx8 is a member of the LIM-homeobox transcription factor family and preferentially expressed in oocytes and germ cells within the mouse ovary. We discovered that Lhx8 knockout females lose oocytes within 7 days after birth. At the time of birth, histological examination shows that Lhx8 deficient (Lhx8(-/-)) ovaries are grossly similar to the newborn wild type ovaries. Lhx8(-/-) ovaries fail to maintain the primordial follicles and the transition from primordial to growing follicles does not occur. Lhx8(-/-) ovaries misexpress oocyte-specific genes such as Gdf9, Pou5f1, and Nobox. Very rapid loss of oocytes may partly be due to drastic the down-regulation of Kit and Kitl in Lhx8(-/-) ovaries. We compared Lhx8(-/-) and wild-type ovaries using Affymetrix 430 2.0 microarray platform. Eighty (44%) of 180 of the genes down-regulated more than 5-fold in Lhx8(-/-) ovaries were preferentially expressed in oocytes, whereas only 3 (2%) of 146 genes up-regulated more than 5-fold in the absence of Lhx8 were preferentially expressed in oocytes. In addition, the comparison of genes regulated in Lhx8(-/-) and Nobox(-/-) newborn ovaries discovered a common set of 34 genes whose expression level is affected in both Lhx8 and Nobox deficient mice.

Objective: Although glucagon-secreting a-cells and insulin-secreting b-cells have opposing functions in regulating plasma glucose levels, the two cell types share a common developmental origin and have overlaps in their transcriptome and epigenome profiles. Notably, destruction of one of these cell populations can stimulate repopulation via transdifferentiation of the other cell type, at least in mice, suggesting plasticity between these cell fates. Furthermore, dysfunction of both a- and b-cells contributes to the pathophysiology of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and b-cell de-differentiation has been proposed to contribute to type 2 diabetes. Our objective was to delineate the molecular properties that maintain islet cell type specification yet allow for cellular plasticity. We hypothesized that correlating cell type-specific transcriptomes with an atlas of open chromatin will identify novel genes and transcriptional regulatory elements such as enhancers involved in a- and b-cell specification and plasticity.Methods: We sorted human a- and b-cells and performed the \"Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high throughput sequencing\" (ATAC-seq) and mRNA-seq, followed by integrative analysis to identify cell type-selective gene regulatory regions.Results: We identified numerous transcripts with either a-cell- or b-cell-selective expression and discovered the cell type-selective open chromatin regions that correlate with these gene activation patterns. We confirmed cell type-selective expression on the protein level for two of the top hits from our screen. The \"group specific protein\" (GC; or vitamin D binding protein) was restricted to a-cells, while CHODL (chondrolectin) immunoreactivity was only present in b-cells.

We hypothesized that genes under control of synaptic activity are differentially expressed between mutants and controls and found that few synaptic signaling genes were differentially expressed. However, all neuropeptide genes with detectable expression on the microarray were differentially expressed, being 3-20 fold higher in control cortex. Genes encoding their receptors and most other synaptic components were not differentially expressed. Differential expression of the neuropeptide genes was confirmed by qPCR analysis. In situ hybridization indicated that the difference in neuropeptide expression was uniform and not due to the loss of specific cells in the mutant. In primary sensory neurons, which do not depend on synaptic activity for their input, the differential expression of neuropeptides was not observed. These data reveal no simple relation between activity of synapses and expression of their resident proteins, but instead identified a unique feature of neuropeptide gene expression, which appears to depend on synaptic activity.Keywords: munc18-1 null mutant mice are characterized by the complete loss of both evoked and spontaneous transmitter release . 6 biological replicates of munc18-1 null mutants, hybridized with 6 pooled biological replicates.

We examined the miRNA expression profile of total serum and serum derived exosome-enriched extracellular vesicles in people with normal glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes. In contrast to total serum miRNA, which did not reveal any differences in miRNA expression, we identified differentially abundant miRNAs in type 2 diabetes patients using miRNA expression profiles of exosome RNA (exoRNA).

This microarray study examines gene expression induced in the C57BL/6J mouse retina by hyperoxia over the 14-day period during which photoreceptors first resist, then succumb to, hyperoxia. METHODS: Young adult C57BL/6J mice were exposed to hyperoxia (75% oxygen) for up to 14 days. On day 0 (control), day 3, day 7, and day 14, retinal RNA was extracted and processed on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays. Microarray data were analyzed using GCOS Version 1.4 and GeneSpring Version 7.3.1. RESULTS: The overall numbers of hyperoxia-regulated genes increased monotonically with exposure. Within that increase, however, a distinctive temporal pattern was apparent. At 3 days exposure, there was prominent upregulation of genes associated with neuroprotection. By day 14, these early-responsive genes were downregulated, and genes related to cell death were strongly expressed. At day 7, the regulation of these genes was mixed, indicating a possible transition period from stability at day 3 to degeneration at day 14. CONCLUSIONS: Microarray analysis of the response of the retina to prolonged hyperoxia demonstrated a temporal pattern involving early neuroprotection and later cell death, and provided insight into the mechanisms involved in the two phases of response. As hyperoxia is a consistent feature of the late stages of photoreceptor degenerations, understanding the mechanisms of oxygen toxicity may be important therapeutically. 4 timepoints in total, 0d (control), 3d, 7d and 14d and a replicate per timepoint.

Differential expression (DE) analysis of individuals with low (LSF, mean= 4 seizure/month) versus high (HSF, mean= 60 seizures/month) seizure frequency identified 979 genes with >=2-fold change in transcript abundance (FDR-adjusted p-value <0.05). Comparisons with post-mortem controls revealed a large number of downregulated genes in the HSF (1,676) versus LSF (399) groups. More than 50 signaling pathways were inferred to be deactivated or activated, with Signal Transduction as the central hub in the pathway network. While neuroinflammation pathways were activated in both groups, key neuronal system pathways were systematically deactivated in the HSF group, including calcium, CREB and Opioid signaling. We also infer that enhanced expression of a signaling cascade promoting synaptic downscaling may have played a key role in maintaining a higher seizure threshold in the LSF cohort.

Histone deacetylase 3 (Hdac3) is the enzymatic component of transcriptional repression complexes recruited by the nuclear hormone receptors. Inactivation of Hdac3 in cancer cell lines triggered apoptosis, and removal of Hdac3 in the germ-line of mice caused embryonic lethality. Therefore, we conditionally deleted the Hdac3 allele in the mouse liver. These mice developed hepatomegaly, which was the result of hepatocyte hypertrophy, and these morphological changes coincided with significant imbalances between carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Loss of Hdac3 triggered changes in gene expression consistent with inactivation of repression mediated by nuclear hormone receptors. Mechanistically, loss of Hdac3 increased the levels of Pparg2, and treatment of these mice with a Pparg antagonist partially reversed the lipid accumulation in the liver. In addition, gene expression analysis identified mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling as being activated by deletion of Hdac3, and inhibition by rapamycin also affected the accumulation of neutral lipids in the Hdac3-null livers. Thus, Hdac3 has a key role in regulation of multiple signaling pathways in the liver, and deletion of Hdac3 disrupts normal metabolic homeostasis.Keywords: Genetic knockout of Hdac3 specifically in liver, and RNA analyzed from postnatal day 17 or 28 livers for transcriptional changes related to the given phenotypes.

Obesity causes insulin resistance, and PPARg ligands like rosiglitazone (rosi) are insulin-sensitizing, yet mechanisms remain unclear. High fat diet (HFD) induced obesity has major effects on visceral epididymal adipose tissue (eWAT) of C57BL/6 (B6) mice, and here we report altered activity of gene regulatory elements with changes in PPARg genome-wide occupancy. Treatment with rosi restored insulin sensitivity, yet surprisingly had little effect on eWAT, leading us to consider the subcutaneous inguinal fat (iWAT). In this depot, rosi markedly induced molecular signatures of brown fat including the key thermogenic gene Ucp1. Obesity-resistant 129S1/SvImJ (129) mice showed this degree of iWAT browning even in the absence of rosi. Remarkably, the 129 Ucp1 locus had increased PPARg binding and gene expression that was preserved in B6x129 F1 intercross iWAT, with imbalance favoring the 129-derived alleles showing a cis-acting genetic difference. Thus, B6 mice have a genetic defect in Ucp1 expression. However, imbalanced expression favoring 129 over B6 was nearly lost when Ucp1 was activated by rosi, or by iWAT browning in cold-exposed or young mice. These results provide a novel framework for understanding how environmental influences like drugs can rescue genetically determined disease phenotypes by affecting the epigenome. C57BL/6J and 129S1/SvlmJ mice were on LFD or HFD; then treated with rosiglitazone.",

    "text": "IMR90 bystander experiment 0.5 Gy alpha particle. The existence of a radiation bystander effect, in which non-irradiated cells respond to signals from irradiated cells, is well established. It raises concerns for the interpretation of risks from exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation. Sparse data exists about the bystander signaling mechanisms and the ability to transmit damaging effects both spatially and temporally. To understand early signaling and cellular changes in bystanders, we have measured global gene expression 30 minutes after direct and bystander exposure to alpha particle in primary human lung fibroblasts. Gene ontology and pathway analyses suggested that the earliest measured changes at 30 minutes after treatment are in cell structure, motility and adhesion categories and a significant number of genes belong to the category of inflammation and cell-to-cell communication. We investigated time course gene expression profiles of matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 3 (MMP1 and MMP3), chemokine ligands 2, 3 and 5 (CXCL2, CXCL3 and CXCL5), interleukins 1a, 1b, 6 and 33 (IL1A, IL1B, IL6 and IL33) growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) and superoxide dismutase2 (SOD2) by real time quantitative PCR. These encode proteins involved in cellular signaling via the NFkappaB pathway and time course of mRNA levels revealed an increased response at 30 minutes after irradiation followed by another wave at 4 to 6 hours. We also investigated protein modifications in the AKT-GSK-3 signaling pathway and found that in irradiated cells AKT and GSK3beta are hyper-phosphorylated at 30 minutes and this effect is maintained until 4 hours after exposure. In bystanders there is a similar response with a delay of 30 minutes. In irradiated cells, inactivated GSK3beta led to decreased phosphorylation of beta-catenin. Our results are the first to show that the radiation induced bystander signal can induce a widespread gene expression response as early as 30 minutes after exposure and that these changes are accompanied by protein modification of signaling modules such as AKT and GSK3beta. There are 12 total samples, 4 corresponding biological replicates of IMR90 cells that were not irradiated (control=C), irradiated (alpha=A) and bystander (B), cells were harvested 0.5 hr after treatment.",

In this study, we demonstrated SD-like clinical features with associated histology in the Mpzl3 knockout(-/-) mice. Mpzl3-/- skin showed increased macrophage and CD4+ lymphocyte infiltration, however adaptive immunity was not required for the onset of skin inflammation. Furthermore, we detected epidermal barrier defects as suggested by increased dye permeability in Mpzl3-/- embryos and altered gene expression by microarray analysis in pup skin. Taken together, these findings suggest MPZL3 plays an essential role in epidermal differentiation and barrier function, and underscore the interplay between epidermal barrier and immunity in SD. The SD-like clinical and histologic features in the Mpzl3-/- mice also resemble those in patients carrying a frame-shift mutation in ZNF750, a key regulator of epidermal differentiation and a transcriptional activator of the MPZL3 gene. Therefore, we conclude that the ZNF750/MPZL3 pathway plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of SD, and a better understanding of skin inflammation and barrier restoration in the Mpzl3-/- mice will provide insight into the pathogenesis and treatment/prevention of recurrent SD.

Three respective cell lines established from primary seminal vesicle tumors, primary prostate tumors, and lung metastases in PB-Pten-NICD mice were also included in the microarray analysis. We hypothesized that the gene expression profiles of primary and metastatic tumors should resemble those of their tissue origins. We identified genes differentially expressed between the seminal vesicle and prostate tumors. The expression profiles of the two cell lines established from primary tumors resembled those of their respective tissue origins, which supports our hypothesis. The expression profile of the metastatic cell line resembled those of the prostate tumor tissues, indicating the prostate as its tissue of origin.

In wild-type mice, expression of chemokines that are ligands for Ccr2, Cxcr3, and Cxcr2 increased at days 32 to 41 post-infection, with a return to baseline by day 75. Concomitant increases were seen in Ccr2 and Cxcr3 but not in Cxcr2 expression. Induction of these same factors also occurred in CD40-ligand and CD40 knockout mice but only at a much later time-point, during uncontrolled Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Expression of CD4 Th1 markers was increased in wild-type mice during clearance of infection. Ccr2 and Cx3cr1 knockout mice cleared Pneumocystis infection with kinetics similar to wild-type mice, and all animals developed anti-Pneumocystis antibodies. Upregulation of Ccr2 and Cxcr3 and their ligands supports an important role for T helper cells and mononuclear phagocytes in the clearance of Pneumocystis infection. However, based on the current and prior studies, no single chemokine receptor appears to be critical to the clearance of Pneumocystis. Gene expression microarrays were from 2 controls (CD40L-KO(+/-)) non exposure compared with 3 controls 5 months exposure and were from 3 CD40L-KO(-/-) non exposure compared with 4 CD40L-KO 5 months exposure.",

Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a congenital myopathy that can result in lethal muscle dysfunction and is thought to be a disease of the sarcomere thin filament. Recently, several proteins of unknown function have been implicated in NM, and their role in the disease remains unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that loss of a muscle-specific protein, Klhl40, results in a nemaline-like myopathy in mice that closely phenocopies the muscle abnormalities observed KLHL40 deficient patients. We show that Klhl40 dynamically localizes to the sarcomere I-band and A-band and binds to Nebulin (Neb), a protein frequently implicated in NM, as well as a putative thin filament protein, Lmod3. Klhl40 belongs to the BTB-BACK-Kelch (BBK) family of proteins, some of which have been previously shown to promote degradation of their substrates. In contrast, we find that Klhl40 promotes stability of Neb and Lmod3 and blocks Lmod3 ubiquitination. Accordingly, loss of Klhl40 reduces Neb and Lmod3 protein in skeletal muscle of mice and KLHL40 deficient patients. Because loss of sarcomere thin filament proteins is a frequent cause of NM, our data establishes a possible molecular basis for NM in KLHL40 deficient patients by establishing a novel pro-stability function of Klhl40 for Neb and Lmod3. Total RNA was harvested from quadriceps muscle of three Klhl40 WT (control) and three Klhl40 KO mice. Each KO mouse was sacrificed with a corresponding WT littermate. Tissues were also taken at 0 days of age to minimize confounding gene changes occurring due to malnourishment as the phenotype worsens.",

Identification of host responses at the gene transcription level provides a molecular profile of the events that occur following infection. Brucella abortus is a facultative intracellular pathogen of macrophages that induces chronic infection in humans and domestic animals. Using microarray technology, the response of macrophages 4 hours following B. abortus infection was analyzed to identify early intracellular infection events that occur in macrophages. Of the more than 6,000 genes, we identified over 140 genes that were reproducibly differentially transcribed. First, an increase in the transcription of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-1a, and members of the SCY family of proteins, was evident that may constitute a general host recruitment of antibacterial defenses. Alternatively, Brucella may subvert newly arriving macrophages for additional intracellular infection. Second, transcription of receptors and cytokines associated with antigen presentation, e.g., MHC class II and IL-12p40, were not evident at this 4 hour period of infection. Third, Brucella inhibited transcription of various host genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycling, and intracellular vesicular trafficking. Identification of macrophage genes whose transcription was inhibited suggests that Brucella utilizes specific mechanisms to target certain cell pathways. In conclusion, these data suggest that B. abortus can alter macrophage pathways to recruit additional macrophages for future infection while simultaneously inhibiting apoptosis and innate immune mechanisms within the macrophage permitting intracellular survival of the bacterium. These results provide insights into the pathogenic strategies used by Brucella to survive long-term within a hostile environment.Keywords: Macrophage, intracellular pathogen, Brucella abortus, inflammatory immune response. Five murine U74A gene chips (Affymetrix) were independently hybridized with cRNA from uninfected macrophage samples (2 independent samples) and macrophages infected 4 hrs with B. abortus (3 independent samples). Washing and staining with streptavidin phycoerythrin was done using a GeneChip Fluidics station 400 (Affymetrix). Scanning was performed with an Affymetrix GeneArray. GeneChip Expression Analysis software (Affymetrix) was used to scan and analyze data. Output was stored in an Excel spreadsheet. Difference calls were assigned the following values: increased = 2, marginally increased = 1, no change = 0, marginally decrease = -1 and decreased = -2. The sum of the six difference calls from the inter-group comparisons of 2 uninfected and 3 Brucella infected arrays (2 x 3) was calculated.

Based on gene expression changes measured in the peripheral blood within the first 2 days after irradiation we aimed to predict the later occurring hematological acute radiation syndrome (HARS). Altogether 18 baboons were irradiated simulating different patterns of partial body irradiation or total body irradiation corresponding to an equivalent dose of 2.5 or 5 Gy. According to changes in blood cell counts (BCC) they were either suffering from H1-2 (n=4) or H2-3 (n=13) degree HARS. One animal was deleted from analysis due to unusual changes in BCC and early death. Blood samples taken before irradiation served as H0 (n=17). A two stage study design was applied. During first stage we screened the whole genome (mRNA microarrays) using one part of the samples (H0 n=5, H1-2 n=4, H2-3 n=5). Candidate genes differentially up- or down-regulated during the first two days after irradiation were forwarded for validation in stage II using the remaining samples and changing the methodology (qRT-PCR). Differential gene expression was defined as a significant (p<0.05) and > 2-fold difference in gene expression over H0. From about 20,000 genes on average 46% appeared expressed. At H2-3 and day 1 about 2-3 times more genes appeared up-regulated (1,418 versus 550) or down-regulated (1,603 versus 735) compared to H1-2 an effect which became pronounced at day 2 while the number of differentially expressed genes decreased. These genes did show an enrichment regarding biological processes coding for immune system processes, natural killer cell activation and immune response (p= 1xE-06 up to 9xE-14). Based on the p-value, the height and constant differential gene expression over time, 89 candidate genes were selected for validation using qRT-PCR. Finally, 22 genes for identification of H1-3 and 7 genes for identification of H2-3 were confirmed using qRT-PCR. For H1-3 most genes were constantly and 3-5 fold down-regulated relative to H0 over both days, but some genes appeared 10.3-fold (VSIG4) or even 30.7-fold up-regulated (CD177) over H0. For H2-3 some genes appeared 4-7-fold up-regulated relative to H0 (RNASE3, DAGLA, ARG2), but other genes showed a strong and 14-33-fold down-regulation relative to H0 (WNT3, POU2AF1, CCR7). Each of the genes allowed an almost complete separation of HARS categories. Taken together, clinical relevant HARS can be independently predicted with each of 29 radiation-induced genes examined in the peripheral blood of baboons within the first two days after irradiation. A two stage study design was applied. During first stage we screened the whole genome (mRNA microarrays) using one part of the samples (H0 n=5, H1-2 n=4, H2-3 n=5).

The most common form of senile dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), is characterized by Ab plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the CNS. AD genetic studies have identified high-risk hypomorphic variants in TREM2, a myeloid cell surface receptor that enables concerted microglial responses to Ab plaques and neuronal cell death, including proliferation, survival, clustering and phagocytosis. How TREM2 promotes these responses is not known. Here, we demonstrate that TREM2 drives mTOR signaling, which maintains high ATP levels, supports biosynthetic pathways and suppresses AMPK phosphorylation and autophagy. In vitro, TREM2-deficient macrophages undergo dramatically increased autophagy and die in response to growth factor limitation or ER stress. Excessive autophagy is also evident in microglia from Trem2-/- 5XFAD mice and in post-mortem specimens from AD patients carrying TREM2 risk variants. Metabolic derailment, autophagy and cell death can be circumvented by engaging alternative energy production pathways. Thus, restoring microglial energetic and anabolic levels may be a future therapeutic avenue for TREM2-associated neurological disease. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from WT and Trem2-/- mice were cultured in either 0.5% or 10% LCCM overnight in complete RPMI.

We compared gene expression profiles in aneurysmal domes between unruptured IAs (UIAs) and ruptured IAs (RIAs) to elucidate biological mechanisms predisposing to the rupture of IA. We determined gene expression levels of eight RIAs, five UIAs, and 10 superficial temporal arteries (STAs) with the Agilent microarrays. To explore biological heterogeneity of IAs, we classified the samples into subgroups showing similar gene expression patterns by using clustering methods. The clustering analysis identified four groups: STAs and UIAs were aggregated their own clusters, whereas RIAs segregated into two distinct subgroups (early and late RIAs). By comparing gene expression levels between early RIAs and UIAs, we identified 430 up-regulated and 617 down-regulated genes in early RIAs. The up-regulated genes were associated with inflammatory and immune responses and phagocytosis including S100/calgranulin genes (S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12). The down-regulated genes suggest mechanical weakness of aneurysm walls.

We demonstrate that gene expression patterns of RIAs were different according to age of the patients. The results suggest that macrophage-mediated inflammation is a key biological pathway for IA rupture. The identified genes can be good candidates for molecular markers of rupture-prone IAs and therapeutic targets.

Purpose: WNT signaling activation in colorectal cancers (CRCs) occurs mainly through APC inactivation or, more uncommonly, b-catenin activation. Both processes promote b-catenin nuclear accumulation, which transcriptionally up-regulates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes. Experimental Design: We investigated b-catenin localization, downstream gene expression, and phenotypic alterations in HCT116 cells containing a wild-type (HCT116-WT) or mutant b-catenin allele (HCT116-MT), or parental cells with both WT and mutant alleles (HCT116-P). We then analyzed b-catenin localization and associated phenotypes in CRC tissues. Results: Wild-type b-catenin mainly localized at the cell membrane, whereas mutant showed predominantly nuclear localization; membranous, cytoplasmic, and nuclear localization was observed in HCT116-P cells. Microarray analysis revealed significant down-regulation of Claudin-7 and E-cadherin in HCT116-MT vs. HCT116-WT cells. Claudin-7 was also down-regulated in HCT116-P vs. HCT116-WT cells, although E-cadherin expression was unaffected. Altered expression of cell-cell junction-related molecules led to tight junction (TJ) impairment in HCT116-P, and dual loss of TJs and adherens junctions (AJs) in HCT116-MT. TJ loss increased migration and invasion activities of HCT116-WT, whereas AJ loss was required to further up-regulate these activities in HCT116-P. Immunohistochemistry analysis of 101 stage III CRC tissues revealed high nuclear b-catenin expression (>=30% of tumor cells) in 15 (14.9%) samples, low nuclear expression (1-29%) in 53 (52.5%) samples, and undetectable nuclear expression in 33 (32.6%) samples, with a trend toward more frequent down-regulation of Claudin-7 and E-cadherin, and increased metastasis in CRCs with high vs. low nuclear b-catenin. Conclusions: b-catenin activation and nuclear translocation induce EMT progression by modifying cell-cell junctions, and are associated with aggressive behaviors of CRCs. HCT116-WT and HCT116-MT cells were used in duplicate samples.",

Detection of the abnormal phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) metabolism in EOC by analysis of magnetic resonance profile (MRS), showed a significant increase of PCho content in EOC cells as compared with non tumoral counterparts associated with activation of choline kinase (ChoK), the enzyme responsible for PCho production following choline phosphorylation in the PtdCho biosynthetic pathway (Kennedy's pathway). The a-isoform of ChoK has an essential role in growth control and signal transduction and it has been implicated in the carcinogenic process. Aim of the study is the evaluation of the biological relevance of ChoK expression and activity to define its possible role as a non-invasively detectable EOC biomarker and druggable target. We specifically silenced ChoKa expression by transient RNA interference in two different EOC cell lines and evaluated the biological effects related to metabolic profiles, cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation and alteration of global gene expression to possibly identify new pathways implicated in altered choline metabolism. Following ChoKa silencing we observed a 70% reduction of mRNA and protein expression with a similar reduction in PCho accumulation as assessed by HMRS analysis. The ChoKa silencing was accompanied by 20% inhibition of cell growth and similar percentage of cells blocked in the G1-phase of cell cycle. No alteration in cell morphology and modulation of the main survival signaling pathways (PI3K and MAPK-related signaling) were observed. By gene expression analysis we found 476 differentially expressed genes (p< 0.01; FDR 25%) in silenced cells. By transcriptome analysis of CHKA silenced cells as compared to controls, among the most relevant co-repressed genes we found CyclinA, related to regulation of cell cycle progression, and cytokines genes (IL-6 and IL-8) related to inflammation and EOC aggressiveness. Acyl-CoA synthetase medium-chain family member 3 (ACSM3), phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 (PPAP2A) and Osteoprotegerin were among the most up-regulated genes. All co-modulated genes have been validated by RTqPCR also in independent biological replicates. Ingenuity System Pathways Analysis (IPA) identified a network of molecules most significantly affected by CHKA silencing whose main functions is related to cell morphology cellular assembly and organization, cellular function and maintenance. Also, the cellular functions predicted to be mostly affected by silencing were cellular movement and cell death that are expected to be respectively decreased and increased in silenced cells. a total of 12 samples were analyzed: Two EOC cell line SKOV3 and INTOV11 were transiently silenced with unrelated or CHKA-specific siRNA pool.

Myeloma bone disease is a devastating complication of multiple myeloma (MM) and is caused by dysregulation of bone remodeling processes in the bone marrow microenvironment. Previous studies showed that microRNA-138 (miR-138) is a negative regulator of osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and that inhibiting its function enhances bone formation in vitro. In this study, we explored the role of miR-138 in myeloma bone disease and evaluated the potential of systemically delivered locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified anti-miR-138 oligonucleotides in suppressing myeloma bone disease. We showed that expression of miR-138 was significantly increased in MSCs from MM patients (MM-MSCs) and myeloma cells compared to those from healthy subjects. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-138 resulted in enhanced osteogenic differentiation of MM-MSCs in vitro and increased number of endosteal osteoblastic lineage cells (OBCs) and bone formation rate in mouse models of myeloma bone disease.

Tumor cell response to irradiation also depends on their microenvironment. Therefore ongoing investigation of three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models provide researchers with essential data studying and remodeling radiotherapeutic implications in cancer treatment. 3D culture models were shown to mimic in vivo cell microenvironment more accurately than the standard two-dimensional cell monolayer (2D) cultures. Growing evidence suggests that 2D and 3D cultured cell gene expression pattern discrepancies following irradiation is highly dependent on cell-ECM interactions. It has been shown that laminin-rich-extracellular matrix (lr-ECM) used in 3D cultures not only alters cancer cell phenotype and response to external stimuli but also affects their differentiation, migration and survivability. Thus, a change in these fundamental cell properties demands us to reconsider data previously collected using 2D in vitro models.

We found that STAT3 plays an unexpected tumor suppressive role in KRAS-mutant non-small-cell-lung cancer (NSCLC). In mice, tissue-specific inactivation of Stat3 resulted in increased Kras (G12D)-driven NSCLC initiation and malignant progression leading to markedly reduced survival. Clinically, low STAT3 expression levels correlate with poor survival in human lung adenocarcinoma patients with smoking history. Consistently, KRAS-mutant lung tumors showed reduced STAT3 levels. Mechanistically, we show that STAT3 controls NFkB-induced IL-8-expression by sequestering NFkB in the cytoplasm while IL-8 in turn regulates myeloid tumor infiltration and tumor vascularization thereby promoting tumor progression.

    "text": "Longitudinal Blood Transcriptomic Changes Predict Lung Function Decline in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. The Rationale: Molecular markers of disease activity that are predictive of forced vital capacity (FVC) progression in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are needed.Objectives: Develop a predictor using longitudinal within-patient gene expression differences (DGE) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to predict of FVC progression.Methods: Patients in the training cohort (n=74) experiencing >=10% relative reduction in FVC% of predicted over 12 months were categorized as progressors in contrast to the remaining stable patients. Baseline to 4-month within-patient DGE were correlated with FVC status. FVC-predictor genes were prioritized by two-group comparison with FDR<5%, logistic LASSO regression with p<0.05, and 10-Fold Cross-Validation with >=50% support. Receiver operating characteristic with area under the curve (AUC) analyses were conducted in training subsets and independent validation cohorts from UChicago (n=27), UPMC (n=35), and Imperial (n=24) where different transcriptome assay platforms and varying transcriptome sampling times were used to derive DGE.Results: Intra-subject Compared to cross-sectional analysis of baseline GE, our longitudinal DGE variation approach demonstratedlargely reduced within-group sample variation and increased statistic power fin progressor and stable groups for prediction model development. A 25-gene FVC-predictor separated \"progressors\" from \"stable\" by Principal Component Analysis in the training and subsets of the training cohort. The resulting FVC-predictor consistently demonstrated high discriminatory performance independent of transcriptome assay platforms and varying sampling times in validation cohorts (AUC= 0.77-0.80). TGF beta was the highest-ranking canonical pathway by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.Conclusions: Our novel short-term longitudinal within-patient DGE approach identified a FVC-predictor which may reflect disease activity and prove to be a reliable biomarker predictive of future FVC decline. Subjects included in this analysis were participants in COMET-IPF (Correlating Outcomes with biochemical Markers to Estimate Time-progression in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), a prospective, observational study correlating biomarkers with disease progression (NCT01071707) (E1). This multicenter investigation recruited subjects at nine clinical centers in the US. Inclusion criteria required diagnosis of IPF was confirmed using a multidisciplinary diagnostic approach per international guidelines using expertise from clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists at the local, enrolling clinical center and age 35-80 years. Subjects were excluded if the diagnosis of IPF was >4 years prior to screening or if there was a diagnosis of collagen-vascular disorder, FEV1/FVC <0.60, evidence of active infection at screening, or comorbid conditions other than IPF likely to result in death within one year. Subjects underwent protocol-directed visits every 4 months after the baseline (0 visit) for a minimum of 1 year, establishing four transcriptome sampling timepoints. Registry patients with PBMC gene expression (GE) sampling and pulmonary function tests (PFT) over at least two time points were included in each cohort.

Myeloid differentiation is blocked in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but the molecular mechanisms are not well characterized. MN1 is overexpressed in some AML patients and confers resistance to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation. To understand the role of MN1 as a transcriptional regulator in myeloid differentiation, we fused transcriptional activation (VP16) or repression (M33) domains with MN1 and characterized these cells in vivo. Transcriptional activation of MN1 target genes induced myeloproliferative disease with long latency and differentiation potential to mature neutrophils. A large proportion of differentially expressed genes between leukemic MN1 and differentiation-permissive MN1VP16 cells belonged to the immune response pathway like Irf8 and Ccl9. As MN1 is a co-factor of MEIS1 and RARA, we compared chromatin occupancy between MN1, MEIS1 and RARA. Immune response genes that were upregulated in MN1VP16 cells were co-targeted by MN1 and MEIS1, but not RARA, suggesting that myeloid differentiation is blocked through transcriptional repression of shared target genes of MN1 and MEIS1. Constitutive expression of Irf8 or its target gene Ccl9 identified these genes as potent inhibitors of MN1-induced leukemia. Our data show that MN1 prevents activation of the immune response pathway, and suggest that restoration of Irf8 signalling as a novel therapeutic target in AML.

The aNAC (alpha chain of the Nascent polypeptide-Associated Complex) transcriptional coregulator is developmentally expressed in osteoblasts and regulates osteoblast differentiation in vitro and in vivo. aNAC can activate or repress gene transcription, a function that is dynamically regulated by post-translational modification. Phosphorylation of residue Ser132 stimulates the sumoylation of aNAC on Lys127 to repress gene expression. Using in vitro kinase assays, we show that Ser132 phosphorylation is mediated by the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). Pharmacological inhibition of DNA-PKcs kinase activity or gene silencing of Prkdc (encoding DNA-PKcs) in murine osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells and human adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells markedly enhanced osteogenesis and the expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes. ChIP-seq identified Ezh2 as a target of the aNAC/DNA-PKcs signaling pathway. Mechanistically, inhibition of DNA-PKcs repressed Ezh2 expression, induced cell cycle block, and increased osteogenesis by significantly enhancing the bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) response in osteoblasts and other mesenchymal cells. Importantly, in vivo inhibition of the kinase enhanced bone biomechanical properties, and bones from osteoblast-specific conditional Prkdc-knockout mice exhibited increased stiffness. In conclusion, DNA-PKcs is a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation, and therefore DNA-PKcs inhibitors may have therapeutic potential for bone regeneration and metabolic bone diseases. MC3T3-E1 cells were grown in aMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) to confluency, followed by a treatment with either NU7441 (1 mM) (Selleckchem) or DMSO (Sigma) for 16h.

High-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains a therapeutic challenge despite advances in the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and chimeric- antigen-receptor engineered T cells. Lymphoblastic-leukemia precursors are highly sensitive to oxidative stress. KLF5 is a member of the Kruppel-like family of transcription factors. KLF5 expression is repressed in B-ALL, including BCR-ABL1+ B-ALL. Here, we demonstrate that forced expression of KLF5 in B-ALL cells bypasses imatinib resistance not associated with mutations of BCR-ABL. Expression of Klf5 impaired leukemogenic activity of BCR-ABL1+ B-cell precursors in vitro and in vivo. The complete genetic loss of Klf5 reduced oxidative stress, increased regeneration of reduced glutathione and decreased apoptosis of leukemic precursors. Klf5 regulation of glutathione levels was mediated by its regulation of glutathione-S-transferase Mu 1 (Gstm1), an important regulator of glutathione-mediated detoxification and protein glutathionylation. Expression of Klf5 or the direct Klf5 target gene Gstm1 inhibited clonogenic activity of Klf5/ leukemic B-cell precursors and unveiled a Klf5-dependent regulatory loop on glutamine-dependent glutathione metabolism. In summary, we describe a novel mechanism of Klf5 B-ALL suppressor activity through its direct role on the metabolism of antioxidant glutathione levels, a crucial positive regulator of leukemic precursor survival. p190-BCR-ABL+ Leukemic B-cell precursors mRNA profiles of WT and Klf5D/D mice were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2500.",

A variety of airborne pathogens can induce inflammatory responses in airway epithelial cells, which is a crucial component of host defence. However, excessive inflammatory responses and chronic inflammation also contribute to different diseases in the respiratory system. We hypothesized that the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is one of the essential mechanisms of inflammatory responses in airway epithelial cells. In the present study, we stimulated human bronchial lung epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells with phorbol ester Phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate (PDBu), and examined gene expression profile with microarray analysis. Bioinformatics suggested that PKC activation induced dramatic changes in gene expression related to multiple cellular functions. The top two functional networks of genes were centered on NFkB and TNF-a, which are two commonly known pathways for cell death and inflammation. Subsequent tests confirmed the decrease in cell viability and increase in the production of various cytokines. Interestingly, each of the increased cytokines was differentially regulated at mRNA and/or protein levels by different sub-class of PKC isozymes. We conclude that many pathogen-induced cell death and cytokine production in airway epithelial cells may be mediated through PKC related signaling pathways. These findings suggest that PKCs can be new targets for treatments of lung diseases. Three groups of BEAS-2B cells were prepared: control, 0.5 hour of PDBu stimulation, and 4 hours of PDBu stimulation. Each group consisted of three biological replicates.",

Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated acute liver failure (ALF) is a dramatic clinical syndrome due to a sudden loss of hepatic cells leading to multiorgan failure. The mechanisms whereby HBV induces ALF are unknown. We used gene expression profiling to establish a molecular definition of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated ALF. Two patients who underwent liver transplantation for HBV-associated ALF were studied. Gene expression profiling was performed on 8 liver specimens obtained from the two patients with ALF (4 samples per liver) and individual liver specimens from 8 liver donors and normal livers from 11 patients who underwent resection for angioma. Statistical analyses were used to identify the signature genes of HBV-associated ALF. Multivariate permutation analysis identified 1,368 transcripts that were differentially expressed in ALF; 709 were up-regulated and 659 down-regulated. The most represented up-regulated transcripts were those involved in the immune response, whereas the most abundant down-regulated transcripts were those involved in metabolism and hepatic synthesis. ALF was characterized by overriding B-cell signature comprising genes related to mature B cells and plasma cells with abundant polyclonal expression of immunoglobulin genes. By contrast, there was a limited T-cell signature and up-regulation of several inhibitors of T-cell activation. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the prominent B-cell signature showing diffuse liver infiltration by plasma blasts and plasma cells with strong cytoplasmic staining for IgM and IgG, associated with a significant deposition of complement factors. Using phage display technology, we demonstrated that the molecular target of the massive intrahepatic antibody response is the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg). These data suggest that the humoral immunity may exert a primary role in the pathogenesis of HBV-associated ALF.

With the population of older and overweight individuals on the rise in the Western world, there is an ever greater need to slow the aging processes and reduce the burden of age-associated chronic disease that would significantly improve the quality of human life and reduce economic costs. Caloric restriction (CR), is the most robust and reproducible intervention known to delay aging and to improve healthspan and lifespan across species (1); however, whether this intervention can extend lifespan in humans is still unknown. Here we report that rats and humans exhibit similar responses to long-term CR at both the physiological and molecular levels. CR induced broad phenotypic similarities in both species such as reduced body weight, reduced fat mass and increased the ratio of muscle to fat. Likewise, CR evoked similar species-independent responses in the transcriptional profiles of skeletal muscle. This common signature consisted of three key pathways typically associated with improved health and survival: IGF-1/insulin signaling, mitochondrial biogenesis and inflammation. To our knowledge, these are the first results to demonstrate that long-term CR induces a similar transcriptional profile in two very divergent species, suggesting that such similarities may also translate to lifespan-extending effects in humans as is known to occur in rodents. These findings provide insight into the shared molecular mechanisms elicited by CR and highlight promising pathways for therapeutic targets to combat age-related diseases and promote longevity in humans. Percutaneous biopsy specimens of vastus lateralis muscle were taken from 15 Human subjects from a group of middle-aged (58.7+-7.4 yrs.), weight-stable members of the Calorie Restriction Society who have been practicing ~30% CR with adequate nutrition (at least 100% of RDI for each nutrient) for an average of 9.6 years and 10 age matched controls that were eating a typical Western diet. Total RNA was extracted from the skeletal muscle using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions, RNA quality and quantity was checked using an Agilent 2100 Bio-analyzer and the RNA 6000 nano-chips (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Total RNA samples were biotin labeled and hybridized to Sentrix Human HT-12, v3 Expression BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA), following Illumina protocols. Arrays were washed, stained and scanned using an Illumina BeadArray 500GX reader. Microarray florescent signals were extracted using the Illumina GenomeStudio Gene Expression software(v1.6.0) and any spots at or below the background were filtered using an Illumina detection p-value of 0.02 and above. The natural log of all remaining scores were used to find the avg and std of each array and the z-score normalization was calculated . Correlation analysis, sample clustering analysis and principal component analysis include all of probes are performed to identify/exclude any possible outliners. The resulting dataset was next analyzed with DIANE 6.0, a spreadsheet based microarray analysis program. Gene set enrichment analysis use gene expression values or gene expression change values for all of the genes in the microarray. Parametric analysis of gene set enrichment (PAGE) was used [pubmed 20682848] for gene set analysis.",

The skin interfollicular epidermis (IFE) is the first barrier against the external environment and its maintenance is critical for survival. Two seemingly opposite theories have been proposed to explain IFE homeostasis. One posits that IFE is maintained by a long-lived slow-cycling stem cell (SC) population that give rise to short-lived transit-amplifying (TA) cell progeny, while the other suggests that homeostasis is achieved by a single committed progenitor (CP) that balances stochastic fate. Here, we probed the cellular heterogeneity within the IFE using two different inducible CREER targeting IFE progenitors. Quantitative analysis of clonal fate data and proliferation dynamics demonstrate the existence of two distinct proliferative cell compartments composed of slow-cycling SC and CP, both of which undergo population asymmetric self-renewal. However, following wounding, only SCs contribute substantially to the repair and long-term regeneration of the tissue, while CP cells make a minimal and transient contribution. Transcriptional profile of InvCREER/RosaYFP and K14CREER/RosaYFP targeted FACS-isolated alpha6 integrin-high CD34-neg basal cells from mouse tail epidermis.Skin epidermis was removed from tail bone and incubated overnight in HBSS (Gibco) 0.25% trypsin (Gibco) at 4degC. Epidermis was separated from the dermis and incubated on a rocking plate (100 rpm) at room temperature for 5 min. Basal cells were mechanically separated from the epidermis by flushing 10 times under the epidermis. Tissues were then cut in pieces of 1 mm2 with scalpel, and trypsin was neutralized by adding DMEM medium (Gibco) supplemented with 2% Chelex Fetal Calf Serum (FCS). Samples were filtrated on 70 and 40um filter (Falcon). Immunostaining was performed using biotin-conjugated anti-CD34 (clone RAM34; BD Biosciences) PE-conjugated anti-a6-integrin (clone GoH3; BD biosciences).

Activated T cells inhibit neurogenesis in adult animal brain and cultured human fetal neural stem cells (NSC). However, the role of inhibition of neurogenesis in human neuroinflammatory diseases is still uncertain because of the difficulty in obtaining adult NSC from patients. Recent developments in cell reprogramming suggest that NSC may be derived directly from adult fibroblasts. We generated NSC from adult human peripheral CD34+ cells by transfecting the cells with Sendai virus constructs containing Sox-2, Oct3/4, C-MyC and Klf-4. The derived NSC could be differentiated to astroglia and action potential firing neurons. Co-culturing NSC with activated autologous T cells or treatment with recombinant granzyme B caused inhibition of neurogenesis as indicated by decreased NSC proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Thus, we have established a unique autologous in vitro model to study the pathophysiology of neuroinflammatory diseases that has potential for usage in personalized medicine. 11 Human samples from 7 sources representing 4 different cell types: 2 CD34 (CD34+ cells purified from adult peripheral blood), 3 iNS (induced Neural Stem Cells derived directly from CD34+ cells), 2 iNS derived from iPSC (Neural Stem cells differentiated from induced Pluripotent Stem Cells from CD34+ cells), 4 NPC (human primary cultured neural progenitor cells).",

We have previously demonstrated that deletion of the Cebpa gene in the developing fetal mouse lung caused death soon after birth from the failure of lung maturation. Many of the transcriptional pathways regulating morphogenesis of the fetal lung are induced postnatally and mediate repair of the injured lung. We hypothesized that C/EBPa plays a role in protection of the alveolar epithelium following hyperoxia injury of the mature lung. Transgenic Cebpa/ mice in which Cebpa was conditionally deleted from Clara cells (from early gestation) and type II cells (from near-term) were developed. Cebpa/ mice grow normally without any pulmonary abnormalities. Cebpa/ mice were highly susceptible to hyperoxia. Cebpa/ mice died within 4d after hyperoxia associated with severe lung inflammation and altered surfactant components at a time when all control mice survived. Microarrays were analyzed on isolated type II cells at an early stage (24h) of hyperoxia exposure to detect the primary genes influenced by deletion of Cebpa. The associated network analysis revealed the reduced expression of key genes related to surfactant lipid and protein homeostasis, such as Srebf, Scap, Lpcat1, Abca3, Sftpb, and Napsa. Genes for the cell signaling, immune response, and protective antioxidants, including GSH and Vnn-1,3, were decreased in the Cebpa/ mice lung. C/EBPa did not play a critical role in postnatal pulmonary function under normal conditions. In contrast, in the absence of C/EBPa, exposure to hyperoxia caused respiratory failure, supporting the concept that C/EBPa plays an important role in enhancing epithelial cell survival, surfactant lipid homeostasis, and maturation of SP-B from pro-SP-B. .

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major risk factor for cardioembolic stroke. Anticoagulant drugs are effective in preventing AF-related stroke. However, the high frequency of anticoagulant-associated major bleeding is a major concern particularly when antiplatelet treatment is simultaneously administered. Here, microarray analysis in peripheral blood cells in eight patients with AF and stroke and eight AF subjects without stroke identified a stroke related gene expression pattern. HSPA1B, which encodes for heat-shock protein 70 kDa (Hsp70), was the most differentially expressed gene. This gene was downregulated in stroke subjects, a finding confirmed further in an independent AF cohort of 200 individuals. Hsp70 knock-out (KO) mice subjected to different thrombotic challenges developed thrombosis significantly earlier than their wild-type (WT) counterparts.In WT mice, Hsp70 inducers (TRC051384, or tubastatin A) delayed thrombus formation. Remarkably, Hsp70 inducers did not increase the bleeding risk even when aspirin was concomitantly administered. Hsp70 induction was associated with an increased vascular thrombomodulin expression, higher circulating levels of activated protein C (APC) upon thrombotic stimulus and increased protection against endothelial apoptosis. Thus, Hsp70 induction is a novel approach to delay thrombus formation with minimal bleeding risk, being especially promising in situations where there is a major bleeding hazard.

Several reports have focused on the identification of biological elements involved in the development of abnormal systemic biochemical alterations in chronic kidney disease, but this abundant literature results most of the time fragmented. To better define the cellular machinery associated to this condition, we employed an innovative high-throughput approach based on a whole transcriptomic analysis and classical biomolecular methodologies. The genomic screening of peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed that 44 genes were up-regulated in both chronic kidney disease patients in conservative treatment (CKD, n=9) and hemodialysis (HD, n=17) compared to healthy subjects (NORM) (p<0.001, FDR=1%). Functional analysis demonstrated that 11/44 genes were involved in the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS). Western blotting for COXI and COXIV, key constituents of the complex IV of OXPHOS, performed on an independent testing-group (12 NORM, 10 CKD and 14 HD) confirmed the elevated synthesis of these subunits in CKD/HD patients. However, complex IV activity was significantly reduced in CKD/HD patients compared to NORM (p<0.01). Finally, CKD/HD patients presented higher reactive oxygen species and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels compared to NORM. Taken together these results suggest, for the first time, that CKD/HD patients may have an impaired mitochondrial respiratory system and this condition may be both the consequence and the cause of an enhanced oxidative stress. For microarray analysis, we studied subjects included in the training group. This population included 8 healthy subjects (NORM), 9 patients with Chronic kidney disease (CKD) on stage II-III (CKD II-III) (mean+-SD of estimated GFR by MDRD formula: 41.4+-4.3 ml/min) and 17 patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment (HD).All HD patients were stably treated, for at least 1 year, three times a week (4-5 hours per session), using synthetic membrane dialyzers. During the study period, no CKD patients received dialysis treatment. In addition, all patients suffering from infectious diseases, diabetes, chronic lung diseases, neoplasm, or inflammatory diseases and patients receiving antibiotics, corticosteroids, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents were excluded. No patients had symptomatic coronary artery diseases or a family history of premature cardiovascular diseases. For all subjects, 20 ml of whole blood were collected. For HD patient the biological material was obtained at the beginning of the second HD session of the week. PBMC were isolated by density separation over a Ficoll-PaqueTM (GE healthcare, Sweden) gradient (460g for 30 min). Cells were then counted and their viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion (>90% PBMC were viable).

Inflammation is a key component of the pathogenesis of obesity-associated type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the nature of T2D-associated islet inflammation and its impacts on T2D-associated beta cell abnormalities remain poorly defined. Using both diet-induced and genetically modified T2D animal models, we explore immune components of islet inflammation and define their roles in regulating beta cell function and proliferation. Our studies show that T2D-associated islet inflammation is uniquely dominated by macrophages, without the involvement of adaptive immune cells. We identify two islet macrophage populations, characterized by their distinct phenotypes, anatomical distributions and functional properties. Obesity induces a local expansion of intra-islet macrophages, independent of the replenishment from circulating monocytes. In contrast, the abundance of peri-islet macrophages is negligibly affected by obesity. Functionally, intra-islet macrophages impair beta cell function in a cell-cell contact dependent manner. In contrast, both intra- and peri-islet macrophage populations are able to promote beta cell proliferation. Together, these data provide a definitive view of the genesis of T2D-associated islet inflammation and define specific roles of islet macrophages in regulating beta cell function and proliferation.

Chondrocytes advance through the long bone growth plate in synchrony, allowing their segregation into one of four zones each corresponding to a different phase of maturation. Beginning from the epiphysis the recognized zones are: reserve, proliferative, prehypertrophic, and hypertrophic. A fifth zone, the perichondrium is located in apposition to the growth plate at its circumferential surface. The progression of chondrocytes through these zones, and hence growth, is regulated by a complex interplay of signaling pathways, defects in which lead to osteochondrodysplasias. At present, there are over 370 recognized skeletal disorders, slightly more than half of which have been explained at the molecular level. Through a combination of laser microdissection, linear mRNA amplification, and GeneChip analysis, our laboratory has acquired the zone specific expression profile of chondrocytes from the distal femoral growth plates of two normal patients. On average, transcripts interrogated by 12,193 or 18,454 GeneChip probe sets (out of a possible 54,000 probe sets) were present in patients 1 and 2, respectively. The homologous inter-array correlations for the log(2) intensities were >= 0.91+-0.01.Keywords: Chondrocyte differentiation program. Populations of cells corresponding to the hypertrophic, prehypertrophic, proliferative, reserve, and perichondrium, were separately isolated by laser microdissection from cryostat sections of human growth plates using a Leica AS-LMD microscope. RNA was prepared from the isolated cells, amplified using a T7 linear amplification protocol, and analyzed by hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays. The distal femoral growth plate (left or right) was exclusively used for this study. Patient 1 of this study is an 11-10/12 year old Caucasian female and patient 2 is a 13-3/12 year old Caucasian male.",

Increasing success is being achieved in the treatment of malignancies with stromal-targeted therapies, predominantly in anti-angiogenesis and immunotherapy, predominantly checkpoint inhibitors. Despite 15 years of clinical trials with anti-VEGF pathway inhibitors for cancer, we still find ourselves lacking reliable predictive biomarkers to select patients for anti-angiogenesis therapy. For the more recent immunotherapy agents, there are many approaches for patient selection under investigation.Notably, the predictive power of an Ad-VEGF-A164 mouse model to drive a stromal response with similarities to a wound healing response shows relevance for human cancer and was used to generate stromal signatures. We have developed gene signatures for 3 stromal states and leveraged the data from multiple large cohort bioinformatics studies of gastric cancer (TCGA, ACRG) to further understand how these relate to the dominant patient phenotypes identified by previous bioinformatics efforts. We have also designed multiplexed IHC assays that robustly represent the vascular and immune diversity in gastric cancer. Finally, we have used this methodology to arrive at a hypothesis of how angiogenesis and immunotherapy may fit into the experimental approaches for gastric cancer treatments. The Ad-VEGF-A164 flank model was performed as described in Flank tissue from harvest day 0, day 5, day 20, and day 60 was taken for RNA generation.

[Objectives]: Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is often difficult to diagnose and distinguish from those of other diseases, because no specific antibodies have yet been detected. [Methods]: We developed a novel proteomic strategy for identifying and profiling antigens in immune complexes (ICs) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 26 NPSLE patients. We performed in vitro experiments using astrocytes and analyzed functional change by microarray. [Results]: We identified ICs of suprabasin (SBSN), a molecule which is thought to play a role in epidermal differentiation. Microarray data showed that the senescence and autophagy pathways were significantly changed in astrocytes with anti-SBSN antibody exposure compared to normal immunoglobulin G (IgG) exposure. [Conclusions]: These findings indicate that SBSN could be a novel autoantibody for the evaluation of suspected NPSLE, and may help elucidate the pathogenesis underlying this disease. The cultured human astrocyte exposed to non IgG, control rabbit IgG and anti suprabasin antibodies with or without lipopolysaccharide (1mg/ml) for 24 h were collected for RNA isolation.

    "text": "Genome-Wide Screen of Promoter Methylation Identifies Novel Markers for Tumor Development in Melanoma. Background: DNA methylation is an important component of epigenetic modifications that influences the transcriptional machinery and is aberrant in many human diseases. In particular, dysregulation of promoter methylation in cancer has already been shown to be associated with repression of tumor suppressors and activation of oncogenes. In addition, detection of altered promoter methylation status is suitable for the design of diagnostic or prognostic tests. In this study we present a new methodological approach for the robust identification of promoter methylation markers and the first genome-wide study for the detection of methylation markers in melanoma.Methods and Findings: Genome-wide promoter methylation and gene expression of ten early passage melanoma cell strains are compared to newborn and adult normal melanocytes. For the identification of markers we applied linear mixed effect models (LME) in combination with a series of filters based on the localization of promoter methylation relative to the transcription start site, overall promoter CpG content, and differential gene expression. The aim of this methodology is to identify markers whose promoter differential methylation is likely to be functionally related to differential expression. We identified 76 markers, 68 hyper- and 8-hypo-methylated in melanomas (LME P<0.05). Promoter methylation profiles and differential expression of five of these markers were successfully validated. In addition, promoter demethylation following Aza treatment consistently restored expression of markers hyper-methylated in melanoma.Conclusions: The proposed methodology allows the identification of robust markers and can be applied to other experimental scenarios where promoter methylation is evaluated. More importantly, the list of markers represents the first systematic effort in the identification of methylation markers in melanoma. Many of the identified markers were not previously known to be regulated by promoter methylation and/or associated with this or other types of cancer. Genome-wide promoter methylation and gene expression of ten early passage melanoma cell strains are compared to newborn and adult normal melanocytes.",

To determine the role of CHF1/Hey2 in pressure overload hypertrophy, we performed ascending aortic banding on wild type and transgenic mice overexpressing CHF1/Hey2 in the myocardium. We found that both wild type and transgenic mice developed increased ventricular weight to body weight ratios one week after aortic banding. Wild type mice also developed decreased fractional shortening after one week when compared to preoperative echocardiograms and sham operated controls. Transgenic mice, in comparison, demonstrated preserved fractional shortening. Histological examination of explanted heart tissue demonstrated extensive fibrosis in wild type hearts, but minimal fibrosis in transgenic hearts. TUNEL staining demonstrated increased apoptosis in the wild type hearts but not in the transgenic hearts. Exposure of cultured neonatal myocytes from wild type and transgenic animals to hydrogen peroxide, a potent inducer of apoptosis, demonstrated increased apoptosis in the wild type cells. Gene Set Analysis of microarray data from wild type and transgenic hearts one week after banding revealed suppression and activation of multiple pathways involving apoptosis, cell signaling and biosynthesis. These findings demonstrate that CHF1/Hey2 promotes physiological over pathological hypertrophy in pressure overload through suppression of apoptosis and global regulation of multiple transcriptional pathways.

Delta-like 3 (Dll3) is a divergent ligand and modulator of the Notch signaling pathway only identified so far in mammals. Null mutations of Dll3 disrupt cycling expression of Notch targets Hes1, Hes5, and Lfng, but not of Hes7. Compared with Dll1 or Notch1, the effects of Dll3 mutations are less severe for gene expression in the presomitic mesoderm, yet severe segmentation phenotypes and vertebral defects result in both human and mouse. Reasoning that Dll3 specifically disrupts key regulators of somite cycling, we carried out functional analysis to identify targets accounting for the segmental phenotype. Using microdissected embryonic tissue from somitic and presomitic mesodermal tissue, we identified new genes enriched in these tissues, including Limch1, Rphn2, and A130022J15Rik. Surprisingly, we only identified a small number of genes disrupted by the Dll3 mutation. These include Uncx, a somite gene required for rib and vertebral patterning, and Nrarp, a regulator of Notch/Wnt signaling in zebrafish and a cycling gene in mouse. To determine the effects of Dll3 mutation on Nrarp, we characterized the cycling expression of this gene from early (8.5 dpc) to late (10.5 dpc) somitogenesis. Nrarp displays a distinct pattern of cycling phases when compared to Lfng and Axin2 (a Wnt pathway gene) at 9.5 dpc but appears to be in phase with Lfng by 10.5 dpc. Nrarp cycling appears to require Dll3 but not Lfng modulation. In Dll3 null embryos, Nrarp displayed static patterns. However, in Lfng null embryos, Nrarp appeared static at 8.5 dpc but resumed cycling expression by 9.5 and dynamic expression at 10.5 dpc stages. By contrast, in Wnt3a null embryos, Nrarp expression was completely absent in the presomitic mesoderm. Towards identifying the role of Dll3 in regulating somitogenesis, Nrarp emerges as a potentially important regulator that requires Dll3 but not Lfng for normal function. To enrich for genes in the somite level tissues that are specifically disrupted by Dll3 mutation, we compared microdissected tissues from wild-type and Dll3 mutant embryos. We generated biological replicate pools from Dll3+/+ (wild-type) or Dll3neo/neo embryos for a total of six pools. Microarray analysis using Affymetrix MOE430A arrays was carried out on the biological pool triplicates for both wild-type and mutant genotypes.",

We hypothesize that a change in the patterns of gene expression is important in these age-related events. To test this, hearts were harvested from young and aged male rats (3-4 and 20-22 mo, respectively). Total mRNA was extracted and prepared for hybridization to Affymetrix U34A GeneChips. Filtering criteria, involving fold change and a statistical significance cutoff were employed, yielding 263 probe pairs exhibiting differential signals. Of the 163 annotated genes, at least 56 (34%) were classified as signaling/cell communication. Of these 56, approximately half were directly involved in G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways. We next determined which of these changes might be involved in anti-adrenergic activity and identified 19 potentially important gene products. Importantly, we observed a decrease in beta1-adrenergic receptor and adenylyl cyclase mRNAs, whereas the mRNA encoding beta-arrestin increased. Furthermore, the results demonstrate an increase in mRNAs encoding the adenosine A1 receptor and phospholipase D, which could increase anti-adrenergic effects. Moreover, the mRNAs encoding the muscarinic M3 receptor, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor beta3, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-related protein were increased as was the mRNA encoding guanylate kinase-associated protein. Interestingly, we also observed eight mRNAs whose abundance changed three- to sixfold with aging that could be considered as being compensatory. Although these results do not prove causality, they demonstrate that cardiac aging is associated with changes in the profiles of gene expression and that many of these changes may contribute to reduced adrenergic signaling.Keywords = agingKeywords = heartKeywords: other.",

The squamous cell carcinomas represent the aggressive type of non melanoma skin cancer, the most frequent malignancy among human population. We have studied here the possible relationship between these two pathways in skin using epidermal-specific mutant mice. Loss of p53, but not pRb, produces spontaneous tumor development, indicating that, contrary to pRb, p53 is the predominant tumor suppressor acting in mouse epidermis. The simultaneous inactivation of pRb and p53 does not aggravate the epidermal phenotype observed in Rb-deficient mice in terms of proliferation and/or differentiation. However, in doubly deficient mice spontaneous skin tumor development is severely accelerated. The tumors are aggressive, undifferentiated and display a hair follicle origin. Detailed analysis indicates that the acceleration is mediated by premature activation of the EGFR/Akt pathway, resulting in increased angiogenesis. The molecular characteristics of this model provide valuable tools to understand epidermal tumor formation, and may ultimately contribute to the development of therapies for the treatment of aggressive squamous cancer.Keywords: Squamous cell carcinoma, Epidermis, Tumorigenesis, pRb, p53, Akt, Angiogenesis.

Osteosarcomas are the most common primary malignant tumours of bone, and almost all conventional osteosarcomas are high-grade tumours showing complex genomic aberrations. We have integrated genome-wide genetic and epigenetic profiles from the EuroBoNeT panel of 19 human osteosarcoma cell lines based on microarray technologies. The cell lines showed complex patterns of DNA copy number changes, where copy number gains were significantly associated with gene-rich regions of the genome and losses with gene-poor areas. Integration of the datasets showed that the mRNA levels were regulated by either alterations in DNA copy number or DNA methylation. Using a recurrence threshold of 6/19 (> 30 %) cell lines, 348 genes were identified as having alterations of two data types (gain or hypo-methylation/over-expression, loss or hyper-methylation/under-expression). These genes are involved in embryonic skeletal system development and morphogenesis, as well as remodelling of extracellular matrix. Several genes were hyper-methylated and under-expressed compared to normal osteoblasts, and expression could be reactivated by demethylation using 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment for all four genes tested. Globally, there was as expected a significant positive association between gain and over-expression, loss and under-expression as well as hyper-methylation and under-expression, but gain was also associated with hyper-methylation and under-expression, suggesting that hyper-methylation may oppose the effects of increased copy number for some genes. Integrative analysis of genome-wide genetic and epigenetic alterations identified mechanistic dependencies and relationships between DNA copy number and DNA methylation in terms of regulating mRNA expression levels in osteosarcomas, contributing to better understanding of osteosarcoma biology.

RATIONALE: The development and progression of asthma are strongly influenced by environmental exposures. We have demonstrated that mice exposed to a diet enriched with methyl donors during vulnerable periods of fetal development can enhance the heritable risk of allergic airway disease through epigenetic changes.OBJECTIVES: Since there is conflicting evidence on the role of folate in modifying allergic airway disease risk, we hypothesized that blocking folate metabolism through the loss of methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) activity would reduce the allergic airway disease phenotype.METHODS: Using a house dust mite (HDM) induced model of allergic airway disease, we tested the effect of MTHFR on disease severity.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Loss of MTHFR alters single carbon metabolite levels in the lung and serum including elevated homocysteine and cystathionine and reduced methionine. HDM-treated C57BL/6MTHFR-/- mice demonstrate significantly less airway hyerreactivity (AHR) compared to HDM-treated C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, HDM-treated C57BL/6MTHFR-/- mice compared to HDM-treated C57BL/6 mice have reduced whole lung lavage (WLL) cellularity, eosinophilia, and IL-4/IL-5 cytokine concentrations. The effect of MTHFR loss on HDM-induced allergic airway disease was reversed by betaine supplementation. 737 genes are differentially expressed and 146 regions are differentially methylated in lung tissue from HDM-treated C57BL/6MTHFR-/- mice and HDM-treated C57BL/6 mice. Additionally, analysis of methylation/expression relationships identified 503 significant correlations.CONCLUSION: Collectively, these findings indicate that single carbon metabolism warrants further investigation as a disease modifier in allergic airway disease. Gene expression profiles of lung in MTHFR-/- mice treated with house dust mite (HDM, n = 9) or saline (n = 5) or wild-type (WT) mice treated with house dust mite (HDM, n = 9) or saline (n = 6).",

HCC515 lung cells with dox-inducible KEAP1 knockdown and/or STK11 re-addition, under two different metabolic stress conditions, baseline vs. suspension, were transcriptionally profiled to investigate whether KEAP1 knockdown can rescue metabolic defects in STK11-null cancer cells and how the regulation of the transcriptome by KEAP1 knockdown is affected by STK11 status and different metabolic stress conditions.In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), stabilization of the transcription factor NRF2 through genomic alterations in KEAP1 and NFE2L2 occurs in roughly a quarter of patients, often in the context of STK11 tumor suppressor loss. In this study, we demonstrate that NRF2 activation in the context of concurrent KRAS mutation and STK11 loss promotes aggressive LUAD tumor behavior in both human and mouse preclinical models. This phenotype is associated with metabolic rewiring and rescue by NRF2 of redox stress, high in STK11 null tumors. Applying a novel, pan-lung cancer, diagnostic NRF2 activation gene expression signature that is independent of frequently co-occurring mutations, we dissect the independent contributions of the three most frequent genetic events in human LUAD (NRF2 activation, STK11 loss and KRAS mutations) on patient prognosis and clinical responses in a dataset of second-line LUAD patients treated with immunotherapy or chemotherapy (OAK trial). Our findings underscore that both individual effects and epistatic relationships among oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways influence tumor biology, immune contexture and patient clinical outcomes. Our work also highlights the value of lung cancer disease sub-classification based on genetic and expression profiling as part of patient clinical management. HCC515 stable cells (KEAP1-wildtype, STK11-null) were plated in 10% Tet-Free FBS media. Cells were stably transfected with a dox-inducible control vector (LUCshRNA), KEAP1shRNA knockdown, or STK11shRNA re-addition.

To comprehensively characterize microRNAs (miRNA) expression and their target genes in thyroid cancer, we performed next-generation sequencing expression analysis of this disease. Recent studies have found that only the most abundant microRNAs mediate significant target suppression. We sequenced small RNA from 8 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) with paired samples of normal thyroid tissue. We found that only a small set of abundant miRNAs are differentially expressed after pair-wise comparison (12 upregulated and 8 downregulated) reaching the minimum threshold amount to repress target mRNAs. We integrated computational prediction of potential targets and mRNA sequencing from the paired normal and tumor thyroid tissues from the same eight patients with PTC. The integrated analyses identified a master microRNA regulatory network in PTC that is involved in essential biological processes such as thyroid differentiation. As both mature products of miR-146b (miR-146b-5p and -3p) were among the most abundant upregulated in tumors, we unveil their target genes and found that miR-146b-3p specifically binds to the 3'UTR of PAX8 and NIS, leading to an impaired translation of the proteins and subsequently decreasing the iodide uptake of the cells. Furthermore, we show that mir-146b and PAX8 regulate each other, describing a novel regulatory circuit that determines the differentiated phenotype of PTC. In conclusion, our integrative genomic analysis uncovers the target genes of two of the most upregulated miRNAs and highlights the importance of a miR-146b3p-PAX8-NIS regulatory circuit that determines thyroid differentiation in thyroid cancer.

In this study, we take advantage of human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived neural stem cells to study the role of p53 during human brain development. We knocked down (KD) p53 in human neuroepithelial stem (NES) cells derived from iPS cells. Upon p53KD, NES cells rapidly show centrosome amplification and genomic instability. Gene expression analysis show downregulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) upon loss of p53. In addition, p53KD neural stem cells upregulate genes involved in neuronal differentiation and display an increased pace of differentiating into neurons and exhibit a phenotype corresponding to more mature neurons compared to control neurons. Taken together, this demonstrates an important role for p53 in controlling genomic stability of neural stem cells and regulation of neuronal differentiation.We used microarrays to identify gene expression changes in human NES cells upon p53 knockdown. NES cells were either transduced with lentivirus containing either Control or p53 shRNA construct. Transduced cells were selected by puromycin treatment to obtain NES cells with stable knock down of p53.

    "text": "Preoperative Diagnosis of Benign Thyroid Nodules with Indeterminate Cytology. BACKGROUND: Following fine needle aspiration, 15-30% of thyroid nodules are not clearly benign or malignant. These cytologically indeterminate nodules are often referred for diagnostic surgery, though most prove benign. A novel diagnostic test measuring the expression of 167 genes has shown promise in improving pre-operative risk assessment. We evaluated this test in a prospective, multicenter study.METHODS: Over 19 months, we performed a prospective study at 49 clinical sites enrolling 3,789 patients and collecting 4,812 samples from thyroid nodules >1cm requiring evaluation. We obtained 577 cytologically indeterminate aspirates with corresponding histopathology of excised lesions on 413. Central blinded histopathologic review served as the reference (\"gold\") standard. After applying inclusion criteria, gene expression classifier results were obtained for 265 indeterminate nodules used in this analysis, and performance was calculated.RESULTS: 85 of 265 indeterminate nodules were malignant. The gene expression classifier correctly identified 78 of 85 as 'suspicious' (92% sensitivity, [84%-97%] 95% CI). Specificity was 52%, [44%-59%]. The negative predictive value was 95%, 94%, and 85%, respectively, for aspirates with AUS/FLUS, FN/SFN, or 'suspicious' cytology. Analysis of 7 false negative cases revealed 6 with a paucity of thyroid follicular cells, suggesting that insufficient sampling of the nodule had occurred.CONCLUSIONS: Though individualized clinical care is recommended, these data support consideration of a conservative approach for most patients with indeterminate FNA cytology and benign gene expression classifier results. 265 cytologically indetermine samples, 47 cytologically benign and 55 cytologically malignant samples.Note: The CDF file for Platform GPL14961 is proprietary.",

    "text": "Dppa2 and Dppa4 directly regulate the Dux driven zygotic transcriptional program [RNA-seq]. The molecular regulation of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in mammals remains poorly understood. Primed mouse embryonic stem cells contain a rare subset of \"2C-like\" cells that are epigenetically and transcriptionally similar to the two cell embryo and thus represent an ideal system for studying ZGA transcription regulation. Recently, the transcription factor Dux, expressed exclusively in the minor wave of ZGA, was described to activate many downstream ZGA transcripts. However, it remains unknown what upstream maternal factors initiate ZGA either in a Dux dependent or independent manner. Here we performed a candidate-based overexpression screen, identifying, amongst others, Developmental Pluripotency Associated 2 (Dppa2) and 4 (Dppa4) as positive regulators of 2C-like cells and ZGA transcription. In the germ line, promoter DNA demethylation coincides with upregulation of Dppa2 and Dppa4 which remain expressed until E7.5 when their promoters are remethylated. Furthermore, Dppa2 and Dppa4 are also expressed during iPSC reprogramming at the time 2C-like ZGA transcription transiently peaks. Through a combination of overexpression, knockdown, knockout and rescue experiments, together with transcriptional analyses, we show that Dppa2 and Dppa4 directly regulate the 2C-like cell population and associated transcripts, including Dux and the Zscan4 cluster. Importantly, we tease apart the molecular hierarchy in which the 2C-like transcriptional program is initiated and stabilised. Dppa2 and Dppa4 require Dux to initiate 2C-like ZGA transcription, suggesting they act upstream by directly regulating Dux. Supporting this, ChIP-seq analysis revealed Dppa2 and Dppa4 bind to the Dux promoter and gene body and drive its expression. Zscan4c is also able to induce 2C-like cells in wild type cells, but, in contrast to Dux, can no longer do so in Dppa2/4 double knockout cells, suggesting it may act to stabilise rather than drive the transcriptional network. Our findings suggest a model in which Dppa2/4 binding to the Dux promoter leads to Dux upregulation and activation of the 2C-like transcriptional program which is subsequently reinforced by Zscan4c.

    "text": "ERK5 Regulates Muscle Cell Fusion through Klf Transcription Factors. In skeletal muscle differentiation, muscle-specific genes are regulated by two groups of transcription factors, the MyoD and MEF2 families, which work together to drive the differentiation process. Here we show that ERK5 regulates muscle cell fusion through Klf transcription factors. The inhibition of ERK5 activity suppresses muscle cell fusion with minimal effects on the expression of MyoD, MEF2, and their target genes. Promoter analysis coupled to microarray assay reveals that Klf-binding motifs are highly enriched in the promoter regions of ERK5-dependent upregulated genes. Remarkably, Klf2 and Klf4 expression are also upregulated during differentiation in an ERK5-dependent manner, and knockdown of Klf2 or Klf4 specifically suppresses muscle cell fusion. Moreover, we show that the Sp1 transcription factor links ERK5 to Klf2/4, and that nephronectin, a Klf transcriptional target, is involved in muscle cell fusion. Therefore, an ERK5/Sp1/Klf module plays a key role in the fusion process during skeletal muscle differentiation. To identify those genes whose expression levels are regulated by the ERK5 pathway in differentiating C2C12 cells, we performed genome-wide analysis by using Affymetrix GeneChip oligonucleotide microarrays. We performed two independent experiments. For each experiment, we used five samples: cells in growth medium (0 day), lacZ-infected cells at two time points (2.5 days and 4.5 days of differentiation) and dnMEK5-infected cells at two time points (2.5 days and 4.5 days of differentiation). Each virus was infected at 1 day of differentiation. Total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Human toxicogenomic studies to date have been of limited size, have mainly addressed exposures at the upper end of typical ranges of human exposure, and have often lacked precise, individual estimates of exposure. Previously, we identified genes associated with exposure to high (>10 ppm) levels of the leukemogen, benzene, through transcriptomic analyses of blood cells from small numbers of occupationally exposed workers. Here, we have expanded the study to 125 workers exposed to a wide range of benzene levels, including <1 ppm. Study design, and analysis with a mixed effects model, removed sources of biological and experimental variability and revealed highly significant widespread perturbation of gene expression at all exposure levels. Benzene is an established cause of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and may cause one or more lymphoid malignancies in humans. Interestingly, acute myeloid leukemia was among the most significant pathways impacted by benzene exposure in the present study. Further, at most exposure levels, immune response pathways including T cell receptor signaling, B cell receptor signaling, and Toll like receptor signaling were impacted, providing support for the biological plausibility of an association between lymphoma and benzene exposure. We also identified a 16-gene expression signature modified by all levels of benzene exposure, comprising genes with roles in immune response, inflammatory response, cell adhesion, cell-matrix adhesion, and blood coagulation. Overall, these findings support, and expand upon, our current understanding of the mechanisms by which benzene may induce hematotoxicity, leukemia and lymphoma. Furthermore, this study shows that with good study design and analysis, transcriptome profiling of the blood of chemically-exposed humans can identify relevant biomarkers across a range of exposures and inform about potential associations with disease risks.Key words: occupational exposure. 29 workers exposed to <<1ppm benzene at most dosimetry reading over a 14-month period (Very Low), 30 exposed to average <1ppm (Low), 11 exposed to 5-10 ppm (High), 13 exposed to >10 ppm (Very High), and 42 unexposed controls (Control) who were frequency-matched to these subjects on the basis of age and gender were analyzed (technical replicates on some subjects, see SubjectID/description).",

Large-scale transcriptional profiling has enormous potential for discovery of osteoporosis susceptibility genes and for identification of the molecular mechanisms by which these genes and associated pathways regulate bone maintenance and turnover. A potential challenge in the use of this method for the discovery of osteoporosis genes is the difficulty of obtaining bone tissue samples from large numbers of individuals. In this study, we tested the applicability of using peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived transcriptional profiles as a surrogate to cortical bone transcriptional profiles to address questions of skeletal genetics. We used a well-established and genetically well-characterized nonhuman primate model for human bone maintenance and turnover. We determined that a high degree of overlap exists in gene expression of cortical bone and PBMCs and that genes in both the osteoporosis-associated RANK Osteoclast and Estrogen Receptor Signaling pathways are highly expressed in PBMCs. Genes within the Wnt Signaling pathway, also implicated in osteoporosis pathobiology, are expressed in PBMCs, albeit to a lesser extent. These results are the first in an effort to comprehensively characterize the relationship between the PBMC transcriptome and bone - knowledge that is essential for maximizing the use of PBMCs to identify genes and signaling pathways relevant to osteoporosis pathogenesis. It is also a first step in identifying genes that correlate in a predictable manner between PBMCs and cortical bone from healthy and osteoporotic individuals, potentially allowing us to identify genes that could be used to diagnose osteoporosis prior to detectible bone loss and with easily obtained PBMCs.

Peripheral blood T cells were relatively unresponsive with only 30-70 genes regulated by P4. IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) expression was greatly down-regulated by progesterone in cord blood, but not PB, T cells.

The progesterone receptor A (PGRA) isoform is the dominantly expressed isoform within the mouse uterus and is indispensable for uterine function and fertility in the murine reproductive tract. During early pregnancy, the PGRA isoform is spatiotemporally expressed in the uterine epithelium. At days 2-3 of pregnancy, PGRA is upregulated within the epithelium and then decreases before day 4, the day of embryo implantation. This decrease of PGRA has been recognized as a marker to initiate the time in which the uterus is receptive to the embryo, yet this has never been functionally tested. We hypothesized the decrease of PGRA at the window of receptivity is required for successful embryo implantation. In order to test this hypothesis, we generated a PGRA conditional expression allele initiated by Cre recombinase present in the uterine epithelial compartment. The PGRA expressing mice exhibited infertility with the inability to undergo embryo implantation or decidualization. RNA microarray and ChIP-Seq analyses were utilized to identify the differentially regulated pathways controlled by PGRA at the time of implantation.

    "text": "Synthetic lethal screening with small molecule inhibitors provides a pathway to rational combination therapies for melanoma. Recent data demonstrate that extracellular signals are transmitted through a network of proteins rather than hierarchical signaling pathways. This network model suggests why inhibition of a single component of a canonical pathway, even when targeting a mutationally activated driver of cancer, has insufficiently dramatic effects on the treatment of cancer. The biological outcome of signals propagated through a network is inherently more robust and resistant to inhibition of a single network component due to compensatory and redundant signaling events. In this study, we performed a functional chemical genetic screen analogous to synthetic lethal screening in yeast genetics to identify novel interactions between signaling inhibitors that would not be predicted based on our current understanding of signaling networks. We screened over 300 drug combinations in nine melanoma cell lines and have identified pairs of compounds that show synergistic cytotoxicity. Among the most robust and surprising results was synergy between sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor with activity against Raf, and diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). This synergy did not correlate with the known RAS and BRAF mutational status of the melanoma cell lines. The NSAIDs celecoxib and ibuprofen could qualitatively substitute for diclofenac. Similarly, the MEK inhibitor PD325901 and the Raf inhibitor RAF265 could qualitatively substitute for sorafenib. These drug substitution experiments suggest that inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase and MAP kinase signaling are components of the observed synergistic cytotoxicity. Genome-wide expression profiling demonstrates synergy-specific down-regulation of survival-related genes. This study provides proof of principle that synthetic lethal screening can uncover novel functional drug combinations and suggests that the underlying signaling networks that control responses to targeted agents can vary substantially depending on unexplored components of the cell genotype.

Contractions were induced by sciatic nerve stimulation (0.5 msec duration, 2-5 volts). The muscles were allowed to rest 15 minutes for full metabolic recovery at physiologic temperatures. Supramaximal stimulation was applied at a rate of 10 Hz for 4 hours. At the end of each experiment the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were carefully dissected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for analysis of mRNA expression via microarray analysis. The contralateral, unstimulated EDL provided a genetically matched, paired control for each specimen. Stimulation of the mouse hindlimb via the sciatic nerve was used to induce contractions for 4 hours to investigate acute muscle gene activation in a model of muscle phenotype conversion. Initial force production (1.6 + 0.1 g/g body weight) declined 45% within 10 min and was maintained for the remainder of the experiment. Force returned to initial levels upon completion of the study.

    "text": "Regulation of gene expression in IECs by HDAC3. The development and severity of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and other chronic inflammatory conditions can be influenced by host genetic and environmental factors, including signals derived from commensal bacteria. However, the mechanisms that integrate these diverse cues remain undefined. Here we demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) isolated from IBD patients exhibit decreased expression of the epigenome-modifying enzyme histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). Further, genome-wide analyses of murine IECs that lack HDAC3 (HDAC3DIEC) revealed that HDAC3 deficiency resulted in dysregulated gene expression coupled with alterations in histone acetylation. Critically, conventionally-housed HDAC3DIEC mice demonstrated loss of Paneth cells, impaired IEC function and alterations in the composition of intestinal commensal bacteria. In addition, HDAC3DIEC mice exhibited significantly increased susceptibility to intestinal damage and inflammation, indicating that epithelial expression of HDAC3 plays a central role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Strikingly, rederivation of HDAC3DIEC mice into germ-free conditions revealed that dysregulated IEC gene expression, Paneth cell homeostasis, and intestinal barrier function were largely restored in the absence of commensal bacteria. Collectively, these data indicate that the HDAC3 is a critical factor that integrates commensal bacteria-derived signals to calibrate epithelial cell responses required to establish normal host-commensal relationships and maintain intestinal homeostasis. In this study, we performed gene expression profiling to examine how the transcriptional profiles in primary live, EpCAM+ IECs from the large intestine differed between control HDAC3FF mice (3 biological replicates) and IEC-intrinsic knockout HDAC3DIEC mice (3 biological replicates).",

Although the function of DNA methylation in gene promoter regions is well established in transcriptional repression, the function of the evolutionarily conserved widespread distribution of DNA methylation in gene body regions remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that DNA methylation is enriched in included alternatively spliced exons (ASEs) and inhibiting DNA methylation results in aberrant splicing of ASEs. The methyl-CpG binding protein MeCP2 is enriched in included ASEs, particularly those that are also highly DNA methylated, and inhibition of DNA methylation disrupts specific targeting of MeCP2 to exons. Interestingly, ablation of MeCP2 results in increased nucleosome acetylation and aberrant skipping events of ASEs. We further show that inhibition of histone deacetylases leads to a highly significant overlap of exon skipping events caused by knocking-down MeCP2. Together, our data indicate that intragenic DNA methylation operates in exon definition to modulate alternative splicing and can enhance exon recognition via recruitment of the multifunctional protein MeCP2, which thereby maintains local histone hypoacetylation through its established interaction with HDACs.

Whether epidermal factors play a primary role in immune-mediated skin diseases such as psoriasis is unknown. We now show that the pro-differentiation transcription factor Grainyhead-like 3 (GRHL3), essential during epidermal development but dispensable in adult skin homeostasis, is required for barrier repair after adult epidermal injury. Consistent with activation of a GRHL3-regulated repair pathway in psoriasis, we find GRHL3 up-regulation in lesional skin where GRHL3 binds known epidermal differentiation gene targets. Furthermore, we show the functionality of this pathway in the Imiquimod mouse model of immune-mediated epidermal hyperplasia where loss of Grhl3 exacerbates the epidermal damage response, conferring greater sensitivity to disease induction, delayed resolution of epidermal lesions, and resistance to anti-IL-22 therapy. ChIP-seq and gene expression profiling studies show that while GRHL3 regulates differentiation genes both in development and during repair from immune-mediated damage, it targets distinct sets of genes in the two processes. In particular, GRHL3 suppresses a number of alarmin and other pro-inflammatory genes after immune injury. This study identifies a GRHL3-regulated epidermal barrier repair pathway that suppresses disease initiation and helps resolve existing lesions in immune-mediated epidermal hyperplasia. A single timepoint was assessed after physical injury of the epidermal barrier and two timepoints were assessed after immune mediated injury of the epidermis following Imiquimod treatment (psoriasis mouse model).",

We have developed a nonheuristic genome topography scan (GTS) algorithm to characterize the patterns of genomic alterations in human glioblastoma (GBM), identifying frequent p18INK4C and p16INK4A codeletion. Functional reconstitution of p18INK4C in GBM cells null for both p16INK4A and p18INK4C resulted in impaired cell-cycle progression and tumorigenic potential. Conversely, RNAi-mediated depletion of p18INK4C in p16INK4A-deficient primary astrocytes or established GBM cells enhanced tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, acute suppression of p16INK4A in primary astrocytes induced a concomitant increase in p18INK4C. Together, these findings uncover a feedback regulatory circuit in the astrocytic lineage and demonstrate a bona fide tumor suppressor role for p18INK4C in human GBM wherein it functions cooperatively with other INK4 family members to constrain inappropriate proliferation.This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

    "text": "SETD5-coordinated chromatin reprogramming regulates adaptive resistance to targeted pancreatic cancer therapy. Oncogenic KRAS signaling is a hallmark of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a lethal malignancy with few treatment options. A major roadblock in deploying therapies targeting the KRAS-MAPK pathway is the rapid emergence of resistant cancer cells. However, molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive targeted therapy resistance in PDAC are poorly understood. Here we find SETD5 (SET domain containing 5) as a major epigenetic driver of PDAC resistance to MEK1/2 inhibition (MEKi). SETD5 is identified in a genetic screen of annotated methyltransferases that mediate MEKi toxicity in PDAC cells. SETD5 expression is induced upon PDAC cells and tumors acquring MEKi-resistance and SETD5 deletion restores vulnerability of refractory PDAC to MEKi therapy in mouse models and patient-derived xenografts (PDX). SETD5 lacks intrinsic histone methyltransferase activity and rather scaffolds a distinct corepressor complex that regulates HDAC3 and G9a catalytic behaviors to couple selective deacetylation with methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9). Gene silencing by the SETD5 complex regulates a network of known drug resistance pathways to reprogram cellular responses to MEKi, a resistance program disrupted by G9a and HDAC3 blockade. Combinatorial pharmacological targeting of MEK1/2, G9a, and HDAC3 results in sustained tumor growth inhibition in murine and human models of PDAC. Together, our work uncovers SETD5 as a master epigenetic regulator of acquired MAPK-pathway therapy resistance and suggests an efficacious clinical path for MEKi in PDAC. mRNA profiles of KPCR cells (n = 3) (sgControl + Trametinib 0.2uM, sgSETD5 + Trametinib 0.2uM, or DMSO + Trametinib 0.2uM, UNC0638 0.6 uM + RGFP966 0.6uM + Trametinib 0.2uM).",

While the high mtDNA heteroplasmy exceeding a critical threshold causes mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis with stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome, the low mtDNA heteroplasmy causes maternally inherited diabetes with or without deafness (MIDD) syndrome. How quantitative differences in mtDNA heteroplasmy produces distinct pathological states has remained elusive.

In the present work, we have used whole genome expression profiling of peripheral blood samples from 51 patients with biopsy-proven acute kidney transplant rejection and 24 patients with excellent function and biopsy-proven normal transplant histology. The results demonstrate that there are 1738 probesets on the Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip representing 1472 unique genes which are differentially expressed in the peripheral blood during an acute kidney transplant rejection. By ranking these results we have identified minimal sets of 50 to 150 probesets with predictive classification accuracies for AR of greater than 90% established with several different prediction tools including DLDA and PAM. We have demonstrated that a subset of peripheral blood gene expression signatures can also diagnose four different subtypes of AR (Banff Borderline, IA, IB and IIA) and the top 100 ranked classifiers have greater than 89% predictive accuracy. Finally, we have demonstrated that there are gene signatures for early and late AR defined as less than or greater than one year post-transplant with greater than 86% predictive accuracies. We also confirmed that there are 439 time-independent gene classifiers for AR.

NO regulated 110 transcripts that annotated disproportionately to the cell cycle and cell proliferation (47/110, 43%) and more frequently than expected contained AU-rich, post-transcriptional regulatory elements (ARE). Bt2cAMP regulated 106 genes; cell cycle gene enrichment did not reach significance. Like NO, Bt2cAMP was associated with ARE-containing transcripts. Cell cycle genes induced by NO were G1/S phase associated (7/8) including E2F1 and p21/Waf1/Cip1; 6 of these 7 were E2F target genes involved in G1/S transition. Repressed genes were G2/M associated (24/27); 8 of 27 were known targets of p21. E2F1 mRNA and protein were increased by NO, as was E2F1 binding to E2F promoter elements. NO activated p38 MAPK, stabilizing p21 mRNA and increasing p21 protein. Subsequent increases in protein binding to CDE/CHR sites repressed key G2/M phase genes and increased the proportion of cells in G2/M.

Aberrant splicing is a hallmark of leukemias with mutations in splicing factor (SF)-encoding genes. Here we investigated its prevalence in pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL), where SFs are not mutated. By comparing them to normal pro-B cells, we found thousands of aberrant local splice variations (LSVs) per sample, with 279 LSVs in 241 genes present in every comparison. These genes were enriched in RNA processing pathways and encoded ~100 SFs, e.g. hnRNPA1. hnRNPA1 3'UTR was most pervasively misspliced, yielding the transcript subject to nonsense-mediated decay. Thus, we knocked it down in B-lymphoblastoid cells, identified 213 hnRNPA1-dependent splicing events, and defined the hnRNPA1 splicing signature in pediatric leukemias. One of its elements was DICER1, a known tumor suppressor gene; its LSVs involved the 5' UTR, suggestive of splicing as a mechanism of translational deregulation. Additionally, we searched for LSVs in other leukemia and lymphoma drivers and discovered 81 LSVs in 41 genes. 77 LSVs were confirmed using two large independent B-ALL RNA-seq datasets. In fact, the twenty most common B-ALL drivers showed higher prevalence of aberrant splicing than of somatic mutations. Thus, post-transcriptional deregulation of SF can drive widespread changes in B-ALL splicing and likely contribute to disease pathogenesis. Refer to individual Series.",

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous malignancy, characterized by a variable clinical course. While clinical and laboratory parameters are increasingly being used to refine prognosis, they do not accurately predict response to commonly used therapy. We used gene expression profiling to generate and further refine prognostic and predictive markers. Genomic signatures that reflect progressive disease and responses to chemotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy were created using cancer cell lines and patient leukemia samples. We validated these signatures using independent clinical data from four separate cohorts representing a total of 301 CLL patients. A prognostic genomic signature created from patient leukemic cell gene expression data coupled with clinical parameters could statistically differentiate patients with stable or progressive disease in the training dataset. The progression signature was then validated in two independent datasets, demonstrating a capacity to accurately identify patients at risk for progressive disease. In addition, two distinct genomic signatures that predict response to chlorambucil or pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab were also generated and were shown to accurately distinguish responding and non-responding CLL patients. Microarray analysis of CLL patients' lymphocytes can be used to refine prognosis and predict response to different therapies. These results have direct implications for standard and investigational therapeutics in CLL patients.Keywords: Gene Expression Profiling of two phenotypic states.

Homeobox genes comprise a family of regulatory genes that contain a common homeobox domain and act as transcription factors. Changes in the expression of homeobox genes are observed in many cancers, including leukaemia, colon, skin, prostate, breast, and ovarian cancers. Recent studies indicate that homeobox A5 (HOXA5) may serve as a tumour suppressor gene in breast cells. However, the precise role of HOXA5 in lung cancer remains unclear. Using microarrays and an invasion/metastasis lung adenocarcinoma cell line model, we showed that the expression of HOXA5 is negatively correlated with cancer cell invasion ability. The ectopic expression of HOXA5 in highly invasive cancer cells suppressed cell migration, invasion, and filopodia formation in vitro and inhibited metastatic potential in vivo. The knockdown of HOXA5 expression via a HOXA5-specific siRNA was able to promote the invasiveness of lung cancer cells. Furthermore, HOXA5 expression was associated with improved overall survival and disease-free survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients with wild-type EGFR (P = 0.0199 and 0.0345, respectively). Genome-wide transcriptome and pathway analyses indicated that these effects of HOXA5 may be associated with the regulation of cytoskeletal remodelling. In summary, our studies provide new insights into how HOXA5 may contribute to the suppression of metastasis in lung cancer.We used microarrays to profile the global gene expression of HOXA5-overexpressing cells compared with mock control cells and identified the pathways involved in HOXA5-induced biofunctional alterations.

Currently, the only \"cure\" is delivery of the baby and placenta, largely because the pathogenesis of preeclampsia is not yet fully understood. Preeclampsia is associated with impaired vascular remodeling at the maternal-fetal interface and placental insufficiency; however, the specific factors that contribute to this impairment have not been identified. To identify potential contributing pathways, we examined temporal transcriptomic changes occurring within the uterus, uterine implantation sites, and placentae from the Dahl salt-sensitive (Dahl S) rat model of superimposed preeclampsia compared to Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. We hypothesized that the Dahl S maternal-fetal interface would exhibit a unique temporal transcriptomic profile unveiling novel biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and mechanistic pathways regarding the development of PE. Our initial study focused on evaluation of genes previously linked to the development PE from using real time quantitative PCR (RT qPCR) and total RNA was isolated from uterus (day 0), uterine implantation sites (days 7, 10, 14), and placenta (days 14 and 20).

Intra-tumoral heterogeneity has been proposed to grant cancer cells a superior trajectory and survival advantage to avoid therapeutic interventions including radiation. However, direct evidence to support the hypothesis via the transcriptome dynamics of glioma during radiation therapy is limited. The current study aim to measure the functional subpopulation dynamics before and after radiation treatment that assist the radiation resistance at single cell resolution. We investigate the single cell transcriptome and biological pathways of primary glioma mouse model and post-radiation early/late time point. Specifically, we used the RCAS mouse model for gliomas, which overexpress PDGFRA as the model. Using single cell transcriptome, for the first time, we confirmed the proneural classification of PDGFRA RCAS glioma mouse model and its heterogeneity. We found that recurrent dominant subpopulations are featured with elevated proliferation rate and hypoxia. In addition, we identified a subpopulation of radiation resistant cells in at early time points with elevated stemness. Lastly, the subpopulations composition undergoes large changes at late time point when the tumor recurred. Single cell transcriptome profiling of radiation treated mouse glioma mouse model identified tumor cell subpopulations dynamics. It provides novel insights into the molecular phenotype and biological functions of radiation resistant tumor cell population. To study mechanism of glioma relapse posterior to therapeutic dose irradiation, we have used PDGF-driven murine RCAS-tva glioma model as described in Methods. These mice develop high-grade glioma at approximately week 6. The tumors mimic pathological radiological and characteristics of glioblastoma. Since tumors in the RCAS-tva mice were driven by enhanced PDGF signaling and tumor cells were potentially derived from oligodendritic progenitor cells, majority of transformed cells were are abundantly expressing PDGFRa. Once we detected the radiographic primary high-grade tumor in RCAS-tva mice, we started to irradiate mice's brain at 2 Gy every other day for five times. During week one post-radiation, we observed complete regression of primary tumors after radiation, confirmed by both MRI and histology. Thereafter, we had followed up the recurrence of tumors by MRI every week by MRI. We demonstrated that the mice had developed secondary high-grade tumors from week 4 to week 8 post-irradiation. We collected tumor samples from three time points: primary glioma (T1, primary stage), early phase of relapse post-radiation (T2, early stage), and late phase of relapse post-radiation (T3, late stage). Tumor samples were dissociated and subjected for FCAS. The stromal cell including immune cells and endothelial cells were removed and PDGFRa positive cells were isolated for subsequent analysis. To examine the transcriptome level heterogeneity of tumor cells of these three stages, we performed bulk RNA-seq and single cell RNA-seq experiments for the FCAS sorted tumor cells using Fluidgm C1 system.",

Although metabolic pathways are complex and tightly regulated, genetic variation among individuals, reflected in variations in gene expression levels, introduces complexity into research on liver disease. This study dissected genetic networks that control liver gene expression through the combination of large-scale quantitative mRNA expression analysis with genetic mapping in a reference population of BXD recombinant inbred mouse strains for which extensive single-nucleotide polymorphism, haplotype, and phenotypic data are publicly available. We profiled gene expression in livers of naive mice of both sexes fromC57BL/6J, DBA/2J, B6D2F1, and 41 BXD strains using Agilent oligonucleotide microarrays. These data were used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) responsible for variations in the expression of about 19,000 transcripts. We identified polymorphic local and distant QTLs, including several loci that control the expression of large numbers of genes in liver, by comparing the physical transcript position with the location of the controlling QTL. CONCLUSION: The data are available through a public web-based resource (www.genenetwork.org) that allows custom data mining, identification of coregulated transcripts and correlated phenotypes, cross-tissue, and cross-species comparisons, as well as testing of a broad array of hypotheses.

Intratumoral heterogeneity is a hallmark of glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, thought to negatively influence therapeutic outcome. Previous studies showed that mesenchymal tumors fare more poorly than the proneural subtype. We focused on STAT3 because its activation precedes the proneural-mesenchymal transition. We first established a STAT3 gene signature that stratifies GBM patients into STAT3-high and -low cohorts. STAT3 inhibitor treatment selectively mitigated STAT3-high cell viability and tumorigenicity in orthotopic mouse xenograft models. Additionally, we defined the mechanism underlying resistance in STAT3-low cells by combining STAT3 signature analysis with kinome screen data on STAT3 inhibitor-treated cells. This allows us to draw connections between kinases affected by STAT3 inhibitors, their associated transcription factors and target genes. We demonstrate that dual inhibition of IGF-1R and STAT3 sensitized STAT3-low cells and improved survival in mice. Our study underscores the importance of serially profiling tumors so as to accurately target individuals who may demonstrate molecular subtype switching.

In this study, we have quantified locally secreted cytokines during primary immune responses against myeloma and B-cell lymphoma in mice. Strikingly, successful cancer immunosurveillance mediated by tumor-specific CD4+ T cells was consistently associated with elevated local levels of both proinflammatory (IL-1aplha, IL-1beta, and IL-6) and T helper 1 (Th1)-associated cytokines (interferon-alpha, IL-2, IL-12).

Th1 cells induced secretion of IL-1? and IL-6 by macrophages. Th1-derived interferon-? was shown to render macrophages directly cytotoxic to cancer cells, and to induce macrophages to secrete the angiostatic chemokines CXCL9/MIG and CXCL10/IP-10. Thus, inflammation, when driven by tumor-specific Th1 cells, may prevent rather than promote cancer.

Here, by performing a side-by-side comparison of mice carrying b cell-specific deletion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) and autophagy, we report that while autophagy appears necessary for b cell survival, the highly conserved Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD protein complex is required for the maintenance of b cell maturation and identity. Notably, SEL1L expression is significantly reduced in human T2D islets compared to healthy human islets. At the single cell level, we demonstrate that Sel1L deficiency is not associated with b cell loss, but rather loss of b cell identity. Mechanistically, we find that Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD controls b cell identity via TGFb signaling, in part by mediating the degradation of TGF-b receptor 1 (TGFbRI). Inhibition of TGFb signaling in Sel1L-deficient b cells augments the expression of b cell maturation markers and increases the total insulin content. Our data reveal profound but distinct pathogenic effects of two major proteolytic pathways in b cells, providing a new framework for therapies targeting distinct mechanisms of protein quality control.

Renal biopsy is the gold standard among the diagnostic tools, but it is invasive and not suitable for all patients. Therefore, new reliable and non-invasive biomarkers for ccRCC detection are required. Secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs), containing RNA molecules that can be transferred between cells, seems to be a general characteristic of malignant transformation. Consistently, cancer-derived EVs are enriched in the blood, urine and various malignant effusions of cancer patients. Therefore, urinary samples can be a non-invasive approach for discovering diagnostic biomarkers.Methods: We enrolled 33 clear-cell RCC (ccRCC) patients and 22 healthy subjects (HS), age and sex-matched, for urine collection and extracellular vesicles isolation by differential centrifugation. Transcriptional profiles of urinary EVs from 12 patients with ccRCC and 11 HS were generated using the Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 BeadChip oligonucleotide arrays. Microarray analysis led to the identification of RNA that were then validated using RT-qPCR.Results: We showed for the first time that urinary exosomal shuttle RNA (esRNA) was significantly different in ccRCC patients compared to HS and we identified three EVs esRNA involved in the tumor biology that are potentially suitable as non-invasive biomarkers. GSTA1, CEBPA and PCBD1 RNA levels decreased in urinary EVs of patients compared to HS. After 1 month post-operation, the levels of RNA increased to reach the normal level.Conclusions: This study suggests, for the first time, the potential use of the RNA content of urinary EVs to provide a non-invasive first step to diagnose the ccRCC.

Although epithelial mesenchymal transition-inducing transcription factors (EMT-TF) are known to impart the CSCs properties to some of solid tumors, it has not been clearly reported in pancreatic cancer yet. Zinc finger protein SNAI2, a member of the Snail superfamily of EMT-TF, is frequently overexpressed in pancreatic cancer cells and the poor prognosis has been reported in cases with high SNAI2 expression. we found the suppression of SNAI2 expression using RNA interference decreased the tumorigenicity in the tumor spheroid (Sph) derived from surgically resected pancreatic cancer tissues. Also, it increased the sensitivities to Gemcitabine treatment and reduced the expression of CD44, one of the pancreatic CSCs markers. Furthemore, microarray analysis suggests that the mechanism is mediated by insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2). These results indicate that SNAI2 may be a critical factor for the CSCs properties and indispensable for the homeostasis of pancreatic CSCs.

The histological grade of carcinomas describes the ability of tumor cells to organize differentiated epithelial structures and has prognostic impact. Molecular control of differentiation in normal and cancer cells relies on lineage-determining transcription factors (TFs) that activate the repertoire of cis-regulatory elements controlling cell type-specific transcriptional outputs. TF recruitment to cognate genomic DNA binding sites results in the deposition of histone marks characteristic of enhancers and other cis-regulatory elements. Here we integrated transcriptomics and genome-wide analysis of chromatin marks in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells of different grade to identify first, and then experimentally validate the sequence-specific TFs controlling grade-specific gene expression. We identified a core set of TFs with a pervasive binding to the enhancer repertoire characteristic of differentiated PDACs and controlling different modules of the epithelial gene expression program. Defining the regulatory networks that control the maintenance of epithelial differentiation of PDAC cells will help determine the molecular basis of PDAC heterogeneity and progression.

    "text": "iPSC derived motor neuron cultures from C9ORF72 carriers. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe neurodegenerative condition characterized by loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Expansions of a hexanucleotide repeat (GGGGCC) in the noncoding region of the C9ORF72 gene are the most common cause of the familial form of ALS (C9-ALS), as well as frontotemporal lobar degeneration and other neurological diseases. How the repeat expansion causes disease remains unclear, with both loss of function (haploinsufficiency) and gain of function (either toxic RNA or protein products) proposed. We report a cellular model of C9-ALS with motor neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from ALS patients carrying the C9ORF72 repeat expansion. No significant loss of C9ORF72 expression was observed, and knockdown of the transcript was not toxic to cultured human motor neurons. Transcription of the repeat was increased, leading to accumulation of GGGGCC repeat-containing RNA foci selectively in C9-ALS iPSC-derived motor neurons. Repeat-containing RNA foci colocalized with hnRNPA1 and Pur-a, suggesting that they may be able to alter RNA metabolism. C9-ALS motor neurons showed altered expression of genes involved in membrane excitability including DPP6, and demonstrated a diminished capacity to fire continuous spikes upon depolarization compared to control motor neurons. Antisense oligonucleotides targeting the C9ORF72 transcript suppressed RNA foci formation and reversed gene expression alterations in C9-ALS motor neurons. These data show that patient-derived motor neurons can be used to delineate pathogenic events in ALS. Transcriptome profiling from iPSC derived motor neurons compared to controls.",

Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is a winged helix transcription factor that plays roles in control and stressed conditions by gaining access to target elements, but mechanisms of HSF1 access have not been well known in mammalian cells. We show a physical interaction between the wing motif of human HSF1 and replication protein A (RPA), which is involved in DNA metabolism. Depletion of RPA1 abolishes HSF1 access to the promoter of HSP70 in unstressed conditions, and delays its rapid activation in response to heat shock. The HSF1-RPA complex leads preloading of RNA polymerase II and opens chromatin structure by recruiting a histone chaperone FACT. Furthermore, this interaction is required for melanoma cell proliferation. These results provide a mechanistic basis for constitutive HSF1 access to nucleosomal DNA, which is important for both basal and inducible gene expression. To examine whether the HSF1-RPA complex regulates the expression of genes, mRNA levels in MEFs with/without HSF1- or RPA1-shRNA were analyzed by DNA microarray analysis using GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix).",

Complex regulatory networks control epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) but the underlying epigenetic control is poorly understood. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a key histone demethylase that alters the epigenetic landscape. Here we explored the role of LSD1 in global epigenetic regulation of EMT, cancer stem cells (CSCs), the tumour microenvironment, and therapeutic resistance in breast cancer. LSD1 induced pan-genomic gene expression in networks implicated in EMT and selectively elicits gene expression programs in CSCs whilst repressing non-CSC programs. LSD1 phosphorylation at serine-111 (LSD1-s111p) by chromatin anchored protein kinase C-theta (PKC-th), is critical for its demethylase and EMT promoting activity and LSD1-s111p is enriched in chemoresistant cells in vivo. LSD1 couples to PKC-th on the mesenchymal gene epigenetic template promotes LSD1-mediated gene induction. In vivo, chemotherapy reduced tumour volume, and when combined with an LSD1 inhibitor, abrogated the mesenchymal signature and promoted an innate, M1 macrophage-like tumouricidal immune response. Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) from metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients were enriched with LSD1 and pharmacological blockade of LSD1 suppressed the mesenchymal and stem-like signature in these patient-derived CTCs. Overall, LSD1 inhibition may serve as a promising epigenetic adjuvant therapy to subvert its pleiotropic roles in breast cancer progression and treatment resistance. 4 treatments (mock siRNA and LSD1 siRNA with or without PMA and TGF). 1 replicate each.",

In vitro neural stem cell models are widely used to model a wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions. However, how well such models correspond to in vivo brain has not been evaluated in an unbiased, comprehensive manner. We used transcriptomic analyses to compare in vitro systems to developing human fetal brain and observed strong conservation of in vivo gene expression and network architecture in differentiating primary human neural progenitor cells (phNPCs). Conserved modules are enriched in genes associated with ASD, supporting the utility of phNPCs for studying neuropsychiatric disease. We also developed and validated a machine learning approach called CoNTExT that identifies the developmental maturity and regional identity of in vitro models. We observed strong differences between in vitro models, including hiPSC-derived neural progenitors from multiple laboratories. This work provides a framework for evaluating in vitro systems and supports their value in studying the molecular mechanisms of human neurodevelopmental disease. In this GEO submission, we upload data from 5 lines of phNPCs as well as hiPSCs cultured in two different laboratories all at multiple differentiation time points. phNPCs: For each of 5 lines generated from 3 donors (15-16 PCW), two independent differentiation experiments each containing two replicates were performed and harvested at four time points (1, 4, 8, 12 wks PD; ~16 samples per line; 77 total samples).

Regulatory T (Treg) cells derived from the thymus (tTreg) and periphery (pTreg) play central and distinct roles in immunosuppression, but mechanisms governing the generation and activation of Treg subsets in vivo remain uncertain. Here, we report that mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) unexpectedly supports the homeostasis and functional activation of tTreg and pTreg cells. Further, mTOR signaling is crucial for programming activated Treg cell effector function to protect immune tolerance and tissue homeostasis. Treg-specific deletion of mTOR drives spontaneous TH2 responses and altered barrier tissue homeostasis, associated with reductions in both thymic derived effector Treg (eTreg) and pTreg cells. Mechanistically, mTOR acts downstream of antigenic signals to drive IRF4 expression and mitochondrial metabolism, and accordingly, disruption of mitochondrial metabolism severely impairs Treg cell suppressive function and their homeostasis in tissues. Collectively, our results demonstrate that mTOR coordinates transcriptional and metabolic programs in activated Treg subsets to mediate tissue homeostasis.

OBJECTIVE: Glial progenitor cells are abundant in adult human white matter. This study was designed to identify signaling pathways regulating their self-renewal and fate.METHODS: We compared the transcriptional profiles of freshly sorted adult human white matter progenitor cells (WMPCs), purified by A2B5-based immunomagnetic sorting, with those of the white matter from which they derived.RESULTS: We identified 132 genes differentially expressed by WMPCs; these included principal components of five receptor-defined signaling pathways, represented by platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) and type 3 fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR3), receptor tyrosine phosphatase-beta/zeta (RTPZ), notch, and syndecan3. WMPCs also differentially expressed the bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) inhibitors neuralin and BAMBI (BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor), suggesting tonic defense against BMP signaling. Differential overexpression of RTPZ was accompanied by that of its modulators pleiotrophin, NrCAM, tenascin, and the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, suggesting the importance of RTPZ signaling to WMPCs. When exposed to the RTPZ inhibitor bpV(phen), or lentiviral-shRNAi against RTPZ, WMPCs differentiated as oligodendrocytes. Conversely, when neuralin and BAMBI were antagonized by BMP4, astrocytic differentiation was induced, which was reversible by noggin.INTERPRETATION: The RTPZ and BMP pathways regulate the self-maintenance of adult human WMPCs, and can be modulated to induce their oligodendrocytic or astrocytic differentiation. As such, they provide targets by which to productively mobilize resident progenitor cells of the adult human brain. 6 samples, three biological replicates (individual patients), 2 groups (A2B5+ and unsorted cells).",

GGF2 is a recombinant human neuregulin-1b in development for chronic heart failure. Phase 1 clinical trials of GGF2 were put on hold when transient elevations in serum aminotransferases and total bilirubin were observed in 2 of 43 subjects receiving GGF2. However, aminotransferase elevations were modest and not typical of liver injury sufficient to result in elevated serum bilirubin. Several translational approaches were used to understand the liver response associated with GGF2.Gene expression profiling was performed in sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes treated with GGF2 (0-3760 pM) for up to 72 h. Prior cytochrome P450 induction studies had unexpectedly demonstrated suppression of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) mRNA in primary human hepatocytes exposed to GGF2 for 24 h. Although no direct cytotoxicity was observed in response to GGF2, the suppression of CYP3A4 transcript levels in primary hepatocyte cultures had a temporal profile consistent with the transient bilirubin elevations observed in vivo. While downregulation of CYP3A4 alone should not influence serum bilirubin levels, it was reasoned that concomitant alterations in the expression of other liver proteins, such as those involved in bilirubin transport, could help to explain the liver response. 92 samples were analyzed representing N=1 per donor, time point, and treatment except 2 samples (Donor 4: 6 h: 0.376 pM GGF2 and Donor 5: 24 h: 0.1% GGF2 Buffer) that failed QC and 6 samples (Donor 1: 6 h) that clustered together and were > 3 SD away from the mean on a PCA plot suggesting that these samples may also be aberrant and were therefore omitted from analysis.",

Alterations in chromatin modifications, including DNA methylation and histone modification patterns, have been characterized under exposure of several environmental pollutants, including nickel. As with other carcinogenic metals, the mutagenic potential of nickel compounds is low and is not well correlated with its carcinogenic effects. Nickel exposure, however, is associated with alterations in chromatin modifications and related transcriptional programs, suggesting an alternative pathway whereby nickel exposure can lead to disease. To investigate the extent to which nickel exposure disrupts chromatin patterns, we profiled several histone modifications, including H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 as well as the insulator binding protein CTCF and the transcriptomes of control BEAS-2B cells and cells treated with nickel for 72 hours. Our results show significant alterations of the repressive histone modification H3K9me2 in nickel-exposed cells with spreading of H3K9me2 into new domains associated with gene silencing. We furthermore show that local regions of active chromatin can protect genes from nickel-induced H3K9me2 spreading. Interestingly, we show that nickel exposure selectively disrupts weaker CTCF sites, leading to spreading of H3K9me2 at these regions. These results have major implications in the understanding of how environmental carcinogens can affect chromatin dynamics and the consequences of chromatin domain disruption in disease progression.

X chromosome inactivation (XCI) compensates for differences in X-chromosome number between male and female mammals. XCI is orchestrated by Xist RNA, whose expression in early development leads to transcriptional silencing of one X-chromosome in the female. Knockout studies have established a requirement for Xist, with inviability of female embryos that inherit an Xist deletion from the father. Here, we report that female mice lacking Xist RNA can, surprisingly, develop and survive to term. Xist-null females are born at lower frequency and are smaller at birth, but organogenesis is mostly normal. Transcriptomic analysis indicates significant overexpression of hundreds of X-linked genes across multiple tissues. Therefore, Xist-null mice can develop to term in spite of a deficiency of dosage compensation. However, the degree of X-autosomal dosage imbalance was less than anticipated (1.14- to 1.36-fold). Thus, partial dosage compensation can be achieved without Xist, supporting the idea of inherent genome balance. Nevertheless, to date, none of the mutant mice has survived beyond weaning stage. Sudden death is associated with failure of postnatal organ maturation. Our data suggest Xist-independent mechanisms of dosage compensation and demonstrate that small deviations from X-autosomal balance can have profound effects on overall fitness.

During epithelial tissue morphogenesis, developmental progenitor cells undergo dynamic adhesive and cytoskeletal remodeling to trigger proliferation and migration. Transcriptional mechanisms that restrict such mild form of epithelial plasticity to maintain lineage-restricted differentiation in committed epithelial tissues are poorly understood. Here we report that simultaneous ablation of transcriptional repressor-encoding Ovol1 and Ovol2 results in expansion and blocked terminal differentiation of embryonic epidermal progenitor cells. Conversely, mice overexpressing Ovol2 in their skin epithelia exhibit precocious differentiation accompanied by smaller progenitor cell compartments. We show that Ovol1/2-deficient epidermal cells fail to undertake alpha-catenin-driven actin cytoskeletal reorganization and adhesive maturation, and exhibit changes that resemble epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Remarkably, these alterations as well as defective terminal differentiation are reversed upon depletion of EMT-promoting transcriptional factor Zeb1. Collectively, our findings reveal Ovol-Zeb1-a-catenin sequential repression and highlight novel functions of Ovol as gatekeepers of epithelial adhesion and differentiation by inhibiting progenitor-like traits and epithelial plasticity.

Little is understood about the early molecular drivers of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), making the identification of women at risk and development of targeted therapy for prevention significant challenges. By sequencing a TNBC cell line-based breast cancer progression model we have found that miRNA-29c is progressively lost during TNBC tumorigenesis. In support of the tumor suppressive role of miRNA 29c, we found that low levels predict poor overall patient survival and, conversely, that ectopic expression of miRNA-29c in preneoplastic cell models inhibits growth. miRNA-29c exerts its growth inhibitory effects through direct binding and regulation of TGFB-induced factor homeobox 2 (TGIF2), CAMP-responsive element binding protein 5 (CREB5), and V-Akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 3 (AKT3). miRNA-29c regulation of these gene targets seems to be functionally relevant, as TGIF2, CREB5, and AKT3 were able to rescue the inhibition of cell proliferation and colony formation caused by ectopic expression of miRNA-29c in preneoplastic cells. AKT3 is an oncogene of known relevance in breast cancer, and as a proof of principle we found that inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity, a protein upstream of AKT3, suppressed proliferation in TNBC preneoplastic cells. We explored additional opportunities for prevention of TNBC by studying the regulation of miRNA-29c and identified DNA methylation to have a role in the inhibition of miRNA-29c during TNBC tumorigenesis.

Unlike many other cancers, estrogen receptor-alpha (ER+) breast cancers are associated with cumulative risks of recurrence and death that persist for decades. We show that molecular differences between breast cancers that recur at distant sites early (2 3 years) or late (3 5 years) support a robust molecular predictor of recurrence with Tamoxifen therapy and provide novel insights into the signaling features that differ between these recurrent cancers. We applied a support vector machine with recursive feature elimination to gene expression microarray data using a training-internal crossvalidation workflow that minimizes the gene selection bias problem. The resulting predictor was validated in an independent data set. Performance of the predictor suggests that it is possible to identify patients at increased risk of experiencing an early recurrence who require other treatments to prevent early metastasis. We implemented a Metropolis Sampling algorithm as a random walk to identify the protein-protein interactions (PPI) most closely associated with ER in 8 PPI databases. We then walked the gene expression data for the top PPIs to discover a signaling network driving early and late recurrent breast cancers. Consensus features between the training and validation datasets define a complex and highly connected network with major interactions among nodes including AR, CALD1, CALM(1,2,3), CDK1, EGFR, ESR1, ESR2, MAPK1, and SRC.

In psoriasis, inflammation and epidermal hyperplasia are thought to be controlled by T cell-derived cytokines. Evidence now suggests that Th17 and Th22 cells infiltrate psoriasis lesions and by secreting IL-17 and IL-22, respectively, may drive disease-specific gene or cell responses. While studies in model systems indicate that IL-22 has a dominant pathogenic role, there is evolving evidence that IL-17 contributes to features of psoriasis. To more fully understand the role of IL-17 in human disease pathogenesis, we examined psoriatic skin lesions obtained from patients treated with an anti-IL-17 (IL-17 A) monoclonal antibody, LY2439821. In a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation trial, patients with chronic psoriasis were randomized to receive 3 doses of subcutaneous LY2439821 at 5 mg (n=8), 15 mg (n=8), 50 mg (n=8), 150 mg (n=8) or placebo (n=8) at weeks 0, 2 and 4. Repeat biopsies were taken from the same lesional area at baseline, week 2 and 6. At week 6, a PASI75 was observed in 0/8, 2/8, 5/7 and 8/8 patients receiving 5 mg, 15 mg, 50 mg or 150 mg LY2439821 respectively and 0/8 patients receiving placebo. The antibody was well-tolerated. In patients receiving the two highest doses, histological and immunohistochemical analyses of biopsies revealed significant reductions from baseline in keratinocyte proliferation, hyperplasia and epidermal thickness after 2 weeks, as well as reduced infiltration into the dermis and epidermis by T-cells (CD3+) and dendritic cells (CD11c and DC-LAMP). Keratinocyte expression of innate defense proteins, S100A7, S100A8, beta-defensin2 and LL37/cathelicidin was also reduced. By week 6, the skin appeared normal with a reversal of disease defining pathological features. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed decreased expression of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), IL-22 and IL-17, key cytokines from T cell subsets Th1, Th22 and Th17, respectively. In order to explore the extent to which IL-17 blockade influences an even broader set of inflammatory or psoriatic disease related genes, mRNA levels from skin biopsy samples were evaluated using whole genome microarrays. At week 2, the highest dose of LY2439821 modulated over 1500 genes significantly (>1.5 fold change [FC], p<0.05). Of these, 51 genes were strongly suppressed (>7-fold) including IL-19, lipocalin, amphiregulin, granzyme B, and several chemokines. In a separate analysis, those genes known to be synergistically regulated by both IL-17 and TNF-alpha showed the greatest normalization in expression compared to genes known to be regulated by TNF-alpha alone, IFN-gamma or Interferon alpha. Our data suggest that Th17 cells, through the expression of IL-17, mediate psoriasis pathogenesis, and that neutralization of IL-17 with LY2439821 suppresses signaling through multiple inflammatory circuits by inhibiting expression of cytokines from multiple T cell subsets, as well as chemokines, and antimicrobial proteins from keratinocytes. In a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation trial, patients with chronic psoriasis were randomized to receive 3 doses of subcutaneous LY2439821 at 5 mg (n=8), 15 mg (n=8), 50 mg (n=8), 150 mg (n=8) or placebo (n=8) at weeks 0, 2 and 4.

    "text": "Bioinformatic profiling of the transcriptional response of adult rat cardiomyocytes to distinct fatty acids. Diabetes mellitus, obesity, and dyslipidemia increase risk for cardiovascular disease, and expose the heart to high plasma fatty acid (FA) levels. Recent studies suggest that distinct FA species are cardiotoxic (e.g., palmitate), while others are cardioprotective (e.g., oleate), although the molecular mechanisms mediating these observations are unclear. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the differential effects of distinct FA species (varying carbon length and degree of saturation) on adult rat cardiomyocyte (ARC) gene expression. ARCs were initialy challenged with 0.4 mM octanoate (8:0), palmitate (16:0), stearate (18:0), oleate (18:1), or linoleate (18:2) for 24 h. Microarray analysis revealed differential regulation of gene expression by the distinct FAs; the order regarding the number of genes whose expression was influenced by a specific FA was octanoate (1,188) . stearate (740) . palmitate (590) . oleate (83) . linoleate (65). In general, cardioprotective FAs (e.g., oleate) increased expression of genes promoting FA oxidation to a greater extent than cardiotoxic FAs (e.g., palmitate), whereas the latter induced markers of endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress. Subsequent RT-PCR analysis revealed distinct time- and concentration-dependent effects of these FA species, in a gene-specific manner. For example, stearate- and palmitate-mediated ucp3 induction tended to be transient (i.e., initial high induction, followed by subsequent repression), whereas oleate-mediated induction was sustained. These findings may provide insight into why diets high in unsaturated FAs (e.g., oleate) are cardioprotective, whereas diets rich in saturated FAs (e.g., palmitate) are not. Comparison of gene expression in adult cardiomyocytes from male Wistar rats following a fatty acid challenge.Isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes were cultured overnight in serum-free DMEM-containing laminin-ciated plates and challenged with 0.4 mM octanoate, palmitate, stearate, oleate, or linoleate for 24 h, after which RNA was isolated and utilized for gene expression analysis. All FAs were conjugated to defatted BSA, which was present in the culture medium at a final concentration of 1%. Control cells were cultured in the presence of 1% BSA alone.",

The ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) is thought to a satiety center and a potential target for anti-obesity therapy. Electroconvulsive seizure (ECS) therapy is highly effective in psychiatric diseases including depression, but also implicated beneficial effects on other neurological diseases. Although it has been reported that the neurons in the VMH are strongly activated by ECS stimulation, the effect of ECS in this hypothalamic subnucleus remains unknown. To address this issue, we investigated molecular changes in the VMH in response to ECS by utilizing a method of laser-capture microdissection coupled with microarray analysis, and examined behavioral effects of ECS via VMH activation. ECS significantly induced gene expression not only immediate-early genes such as Fos, Fosb and Jun, but also Bdnf, Adcyap1, and Hrh1 in the VMH after a single or repeated stimulus. Mice received one or 7 times shock of ECS and their brains were collected at 2 h (VMH_1stECS2h, VMH_7thECS2h) or 6 h after shock (VMH_1stECS6h, VMH_7thECS6h). The brains of sham-treated animals were collected at 2 h after treatment(VMH_sham). The VMH was microdissected from dehydrated brain sections, and its total RNA was extracted.

We mapped the global DNA methylation patterns in selected prostate tissues and cell lines using Methylplex-Next Generation Sequencing (M-NGS). Hidden Markov Model based next generation sequence analysis identified ~68,000 methylated regions per sample. While global CpG Island (CGI) methylation was not differential between benign adjacent and cancer samples, overall promoter CGI methylation increased from ~12.6% in benign samples to 19.3% and 21.8% in localized and metastatic cancer tissues, respectively. We found distinct patterns of promoter methylation around transcription start sites, where methylation occurred not only on the CGIs, but also on flanking regions and CGI sparse promoters. Among the 6,691 methylated promoters in prostate tissues, 2481 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are cancer specific, including numerous novel DMRs. A novel cancer specific DMR in WFDC2 promoter showed heavy methylation in cancer (17/22 tissues, 6/6 cell lines), but not in the benign tissues (0/10) and normal PrEC cells. Integration of LNCaP DNA methylation and H3K4me3 data suggested an epigenetic mechanism for alternate transcription start site utilization and these modifications segregated into distinct regions when present on the same promoter. Finally, we observed differences in repeat element methylation, particularly LINE-1, between ERG gene fusion positive and negative cancers.

    "text": "Estrogen effects on MCF-7 breast cancer cells co-expressing ERa and ERb. Two subtypes of the estrogen receptor, ERalpha and ERbeta, mediate the actions of estrogens, and the majority of human breast tumors contain both ERalpha and ERbeta. To examine the possible interactions and modulatory effects of ERbeta on ERalpha activity, we have used adenoviral gene delivery to produce human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells expressing ERbeta, along with their endogenous ERalpha. We have examined the effects of ERb expression on genome-wide gene expression by Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays. We find that ERbeta modulated estrogen gene expression on nearly 24% of E2-stimulated genes but only 8% of E2-inhibited genes. We find that ERbeta modulation is gene-specific, enhancing or counteracting ERalpha regulation for distinct subsets of estrogen target genes. Introduction of ERbeta into ERalpha-containing cells induced up/down-regulation of many estrogen target in the absence of any added ligand. In addition, ERbeta presence elicited the expression of a unique set of genes that were not regulated by ERalpha alone. ERbeta modulated the expression of genes in many functional categories, but the greatest numbers were associated with transcription factor and signal transduction pathways. Regulation of multiple components in the TGF beta, SDF1, and semaphorin pathways, may contribute to the suppression of proliferation observed with ERbeta both in the presence and absence of estrogen. Hence, ERbeta modulates ERalpha gene regulation in diverse ways that may contribute to its growth-inhibiting beneficial effects in breast cancerKeywords: modulatory effects of ERb on ERa. MCF-7 cells expressing endogenous ERalpha were infected with adenovirus carrying either estrogen receptor beta (AdERb) or no insert (Ad) at multiplicity of infection (moi) of 5 or 50.

High sugar consumption, as well as high-fat diet, is a known cause of obesity and metabolic syndrome. However, the synergistic effect of high-sugar and high-fat consumption rarely has been evaluated, especially in terms of transcriptional regulation. Therefore, we focused on the effect of high sugar consumption on hepatic transcriptional networks in normal and high fat-fed mice. C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups and were provided either 23%(w/v) sugar solution or plain water with either high-fat or normal-fat diet for 10 weeks. As a result, high sugar consumption significantly altered lipid metabolism-related genes in normal fat-fed mice; however, in high fat-fed mice, high sugar consumption altered inflammation-responsive genes rather than lipid metabolism. After all, these modulations eventually increased lipid accumulation in the liver and caused systemic metabolic disturbances. These observations for the first time suggested that high sugar consumption along with high-fat diet could lead to the development of severe metabolic syndrome via altering hepatic transcriptional networks. Total RNA was obtained from liver tissues in C57BL/6J mice supplied either plain water or 23% (w/v) sugar drink with either normal- or high-fat diet for 10 weeks.",

Interleukin 22 (IL-22) plays a pivotal role in the immune control of gut commensal and pathogenic bacteria and is secreted by a heterogeneous population of intestinal T cells, NCR- ILC3 and NCR+ILC3. Expression of NCR by ILC3 is believed to define an irreversible effector ILC3 end-state fate in which these cells are key to control of bacterial infection via their production of IL-22. Here we identify the core transcriptional signature that drives the differentiation of NCR- ILC3 into NCR+ ILC3 and reveal that NCR+ILC3 exhibit more plasticity than originally thought, as NCR+ ILC3 can revert to NCR- ILC3. Contrary to the prevailing understanding of NCR+ ILC3 genesis and function, in vivo analyses of mice conditionally deleted of the key ILC3 genes Stat3, Il22, Tbet and Mcl1 demonstrated that NCR+ ILC3 were not essential for the control of colonic infections in the presence of T cells. However, NCR+ ILC3 were mandatory for homeostasis of the caecum.

Based on substantial side effects of existing pharmacological approaches, efficient and safe insulin sensitization and glucose control remain critical therapeutic aims to prevent diabetic late complications 3. Here, we identify Transforming Growth Factor beta-like Stimulated Clone (TSC) 22 D4 as a critical molecular determinant of insulin signaling and glucose handling. Hepatocyte-specific inactivation of TSC22D4 enhanced insulin signaling in liver and skeletal muscle, while hepatic TSC22D4 overexpression blunted insulin tissue responses. Consequently, hepatic TSC22D4 inhibition both prevented and reversed hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance in various diabetes mouse models, respectively. TSC22D4 was found to exert its effects on systemic glucose homeostasis - in large parts - through the transcriptional regulation of the small secretory protein lipocalin (LCN) 13 as demonstrated by chromatin recruitment and genetic rescue experiments in vivo. As hepatic TSC22D4 levels were found to be elevated in human diabetic patients, correlating with decreased insulin sensitivity and hyperglycemia, our results establish the inhibition of TSC22D4 as an attractive insulin sensitizing option in diabetes therapy. 28 BKS.Cg-Dock7m +/+ Leprdb/J (000642) mice (12 week old ) were divided to 4 forms of treatment (n=7 per treatment group) consisting of 4 different shRNA adenoviruses (reference sample: control shRNA), LCN13 (LCN13 shRNA), TSC22D4 (TSC22D4 shRNA), TSC22D4 plus LCN13 (TSC22D4+LCN13 shRNA). 1 week after shRNA injection animals were sacrificed, liver, abdominal fat tissue, gastrocnemius tissue was immediately snap frozen. 3 representative animals of each treatment group were selected for microarray analysis (abdominal fat tissue).",

In order to discover the mechanism of interspecies-pregnant failure and find ways to overcome the xeon-pregnant obstacles, we chosen the rat embryos pregnant in mouse uterus as a interspecies-pregnancy model. Three groups were set, mouse embryos to mouse recipients (MM) as control group, rat embryos to mouse recipients (RM), and rat and mouse embryos to mouse recipients together (RMM) as experiment groups. The former studies showed that rat embryos live no longer than day 7 of mouse pregnancy (D7). Our results showed that rat embryos survived to D7, and still existed to day 9 of mouse pregnancy (D9) in RM group. Surprisingly, the rat embryos survived to day 13 of the mouse gestation (D13) in RMM group. Microarray analysis was used to detect the global-gene expression profile changes of the whole implantation sites among the three groups at D7 and D9. By this way, we screened out the genes promoting the implanted rat embryos development in a mouse uterus which helped the rat embryos survive to D13 in RMM group compared with RM group, and the genes hindering the rat embryos development in a mouse uterus which prevented rat embryos living longer than D7 in RM group and D13 in RMM group compared with MM group. These findings provide insights into the mechanism of interspecies pregnant failure and new idea for interspecies pregnant studies.Keywords: time course, pregnancy day. microarray was use to screen the genes among the day 7 and day 9 implantation sites of rat embryos implantation sites in a mouse uterus between rat embryos transfer to mouse recipients and rat embryos transfer to mouse recipients with mouse embryos. The mouse day7 and day 9 embryos implantation sites were use as control.totally 6 samples were analyzed, each samples two replications (one of them had three replications).",

Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Latent Membrane Protein 1 (LMP1) transforms rodent fibroblasts and is expressed in most EBV-associated malignancies. LMP1 Transformation Effector Site 2 (TES2)/C-Terminal Activation Region 2 (CTAR2) activates NF-kappaB, p38, JNK, ERK and IRF7 pathways. We have investigated LMP1 TES2 genome-wide RNA effects at 4 time points after LMP1 TES2 expression in HEK 293 cells. Using a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of < 0.001 after correction for multiple hypotheses, LMP1 TES2 caused > 2-fold changes in 1916 mRNAs; 1479 RNAs were up-regulated and 437 down-regulated. In contrast to TNFalpha stimulation, which transiently up-regulates many target genes, LMP1 TES2 maintained most RNA effects through the time course, despite robust and sustained induction of negative feedback regulators, such as IkappaBalpha and A20. LMP1 TES2 regulated RNAs encode many NF-kappaB signaling proteins and secondary interacting proteins. Consequently, many LMP1 TES2-regulated RNAs encode proteins that form an extensive interactome. Gene Set Enrichment Analyses found LMP1 TES2 up-regulated genes to be significantly enriched for Pathways in Cancer, B-and T-cell receptor signaling, and Toll-like receptor signaling. Surprisingly, LMP1 TES2 and IkappaBalpha super-repressor co-expression decreased LMP1 TES2 RNA effects to only 5 RNAs with FDR<0.001 and >2 fold change. Thus, canonical NF-kappaB activation is critical for almost all LMP1 TES2 RNA effects in HEK-293 cells and a more significant therapeutic target than previously appreciated. An LMP1 double point mutant (P204A, Q206A) was used to construct a HEK-293 TET-On LMP1 TES2 cell line. Stable cell clones were selected that carry an inducible system for LMP1 TES2 expression. The Tet-system is composed of three parts: 1) the LMP1 TES2 cDNA cloned into the tetracycline-regulated pJEF vector; 2) a tetracycline suppressor (tTS) that binds Tet-operator sites in the absence of tetracyclines and silences expression; 3) a reverse-tetracycline transactivator fused to the 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4HT) ligand binding domain (rTTA M2). LMP1 expression was induced by addition of doxycycline (1 ug/ml) and 4HT (100 nM). For simultaneous inducible expression of LMP1 TES2 and an IkBa super-repressor, a stable cell line was derived. A pJEF vector encoding IkBa residues 37-317 was introduced into the inducible LMP1 TES2 cell line. Cell lines were cultured with DMEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% tetracycline-free serum (Clontech). LMP1 expression was induced by addition of tetracycline (1 ug/ml). RNA samples were collected from triplicate samples using RNABee (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions from 293 cells induced for LMP1 TES2 (and IkBa super-repressor, where indicated) expression at 0, 6, 9, 12 and 24 hours of induction. Cells were in the log-phase of growth. Gene expression profiles were assayed using the Affymetrix HU-133 plus2 GeneChip according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time RT-PCR was performed with the Power SYBR Green RNA-to-CT(tm) 1-Step Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

To investigate the participation of deafness genes in the genetic program of the superior olivary complex (SOC), a prominent auditory brainstem center, we performed a comparative genome-wide microarray based gene expression analysis of the rat SOC and the rat brain at postnatal days (P) P4 and P25. Data were validated by qRT-PCR. Statistical analyses revealed 912 oligos up-regulated in the SOC at P4 and 1609 at P25. A total of 453 oligos were up-regulated in the SOC at both developmental stages. Subsequently, a list of 138 transcripts associated with hearing-impairment was extracted from publically available databases and literature. 26 of these transcripts were present in SOC-related gene signature lists, whereas only 11 were present in brain-related gene signature lists. Furthermore, in all 3 SOC-related gene signature lists, transcripts associated with hearing impairment were significantly enriched. Finally, there was a tendency of the SOC-related genes to map to human deafness loci with unknown etiology.Altogether, our study identified a tight genetic link between the SOC-related genetic program and deafness genes. The genome wide expression during the postnatal development of the SOC and the brain was investigated at two different time points: at postnatal (P) day 4 (before hearing onset) and at P25 (after hearing onset).

    "text": "BMPR2 mutation carriers with and without evidence of PAH. Background: While BMPR2 mutation strongly predisposes to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), only 20% of mutation carriers develop clinical disease. This finding suggests that modifier genes contribute to FPAH clinical expression. Since modifiers are likely to be common alleles, this problem is not tractable by traditional genetic approaches. Further, examination of gene expression is complicated by confounding effects attributable to drugs and the disease process itself. Methods: To resolve these problems, B-cells were isolated, EBV-immortalized, and cultured from familial PAH patients with BMPR2 mutations, mutation positive but disease-free family members, and family members without mutation. This allows examination of differences in gene expression without drug or disease-related effects. These differences were assayed by Affymetrix array, with follow-up by quantitative RT-PCR and additional statistical analyses. Results: By gene array, we found consistent alterations in multiple pathways with known relationship to PAH, including actin organization, immune function, calcium balance, growth, and apoptosis. Selected genes were verified by quantitative RT-PCR using a larger sample set. Analysis of overrepresented gene ontology groups suggests that it is pathway-specific, not gene-specific changes that carry increased risk of disease. Conclusions: B-cell lines are a valuable and accessible tool for assaying alterations in gene expression free from drug and disease effects. Predisposition to disease within BMPR2 mutation carriers was linked to several pathways, including proliferation, GTP signaling, and stress response.Keywords: Search for modifier genes.

Purpose: Small-cell prostate carcinoma (SCPC) morphology predicts for a distinct clinical behavior, resistance to androgen ablation, and frequent but short responses to chemotherapy. The model systems we report reflect the biology of the human disease and can be used to improve our understanding of SCPC and to develop new therapeutic strategies for it.Experimental Design: We developed a set of CRPC xenografts and examined their fidelity to their human tumors of origin. We compared the expression and genomic profiles of SCPC and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) xenografts to those of typical prostate adenocarcinoma xenografts and used a panel of 60 human tumors to validate our findings using immunohistochemistry.Results: We show that SCPC and LCNEC xenograft models retain high fidelity to their human tumors of origin and are characterized by a marked upregulation of UBE2C and other M-phase cell cycle genes in the absence of AR, retinoblastoma (RB1) and cyclin D1 (CCND1) expression and confirm these findings in a panel of CRPC patients' samples. In addition, array comparative genomic hybridization of the xenografts showed that the SCPC/LCNEC tumors display more copy number variations than the adenocarcinoma counterparts and that there is amplification of the UBE2C locus and microdeletions of RB1 in a subset of these, but no AR nor CCND1 deletions. Moreover, the AR, RB1, and CCND1 promoters showed no CpG methylation in the SCPC xenografts.Conclusion: Modeling human prostate cancer with xenografts allows in-depth and detailed studies of its underlying biology. The detailed clinical annotation of the donor tumors enables associations of anticipated relevance to be made. Futures studies in the xenografts will address the functional significance of the findings. 22 samples were analysed, that included MDA PCa 79 (n = 3), 117-9 (n = 3), 130 (n = 2), 144-4 (n = 4), 144-13 (n = 5), 146-10 (n = 3), 155-2 (n = 1), and 155-12 (n = 1).

However, the latter assay has been interpreted by some as one type of human-animal chimera and studies involving human-animal chimerism present a wide range of ethical issues with restrictive legislation in some countries. The need for teratoma assays is compelling because unproven differentiation may suggest a dangerously flawed cell resource for use in future therapies. We find that a three dimensional anchorage independent growth protocol for hESCs using methylcellulose and matrigel encourages prolonged growth of embryoid bodies (EBs) leading onto formation of teratomas in vitro.

    "text": "Allele-specific FKBP5 DNA demethylation: a molecular mediator of gene-childhood trauma interactions. While the paradigm that genetic predisposition and environmental exposures interact to shape development and function of the human brain and ultimately the risk of psychiatric disorders has drawn wide interest, the corresponding molecular mechanisms have not been elucidated yet. Here we show that a functional polymorphism altering chromatin interaction between the transcription start site and long range enhancers in the FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) gene, an important regulator of the stress hormone system, increases the risk of developing stress-related psychiatric disorders in adulthood by allele-specific, childhood trauma-dependent DNA demethylation in functional glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) of FKBP5. This demethylation is linked to increased stress-dependent gene transcription followed by a long-term dysregulation of the stress hormone system and a global impact on the function of immune cells and brain areas associated with stress regulation. This first identification of molecular mechanisms of genotype-directed long-term environmental reactivity will also critically contribute to designing more effective treatment strategies for stress-related disorders.Effects of FKBP5 rs1360780 genotype x environment interaction on peripheral blood mRNA expression of GR responsive genes, as measured by gene expression arrays, were explored in 129 individuals (child abuse/risk allele carrier N = 40, child abuse/protective allele carrier N = 15; and no child abuse/risk allele carrier N = 60, no child abuse/protective allele carrier N = 14). In all 129 individuals, 1627 transcripts showed a significant correlation with plasma cortisol concentrations, suggesting their GR responsiveness. The correlation of 76 of these transcripts with cortisol plasma levels showed significant differences when stratifying by FKBP5 genotype in individuals with child abuse (Fisher z score >= 1.96) For these 76 transcripts, the mean absolute correlation coefficient with plasma cortisol was R = 0.23 in the risk allele carriers with child abuse, that is those exhibiting a demethylation of FKBP5 intron 7 as compared to R = 0.74 in the carriers of the protective genotype with child abuse where intron 7 methylation remains largely stable. This indicates a relative GR-resistance in the trauma exposed FKBP5 risk allele vs. protective genotype carriers. These 76 transcripts did not show a genotype-dependent difference in correlation coefficients in non-trauma exposed individuals suggesting that exposure to early trauma enhances FKBP5 genotype-dependent effect of GR sensitivity, most likely by epigenetic mechanisms. These findings suggest that the combination of FKBP5 risk allele carrier status and early trauma exposure alters the stress hormone-dependent regulation of several genes in peripheral blood cells, and might thereby enhance the reported association of early trauma with immune and inflammatory dysregulation, further promoting system-wide symptoms of stress-related disorders.",

We used a short-term cocaine-dependent conditioned place preference (CPP) to identify genetic hallmarks of early steps of reward memory in basal ganglia including accumbens nucleus (NAc), globus pallidus (GP) and subthalamic nucleus (STN). Using genome-wide microarray analysis and CPP as a quantitative trait, we found that synaptic plasticity-related genes are deregulated in these three structures. A significant enrichment in bona fide transcripts involved in dendritic spine local translation was evidenced. mGluR5 is transcriptionally deregulated in Acc and GP of cocaine-treated animals. Grin3a that encodes a NMDA receptor subunit involved in Ca++ permeability is deregulated in NAc. Furthermore, Orexin/Hcrt transcript level is decreased in STN, a region known to be involved in discriminating addictive drugs and natural rewards. We also found that mGluR5 and Grin3a expression deregulation is sufficient to induce changes in synaptic plasticity-related genes. Altogether, these results suggest that a combined deregulation of mGluR5 and Grin3A pathway in NAc, mGluR5 in GP and orexin system in STN may generate an incentive memory contrasted between addictive drugs and natural rewards. Such pathways may include clusters of genes that are potential susceptibility genes for transition to addiction. Agilent Whole Mouse Genome oligomicroarrays (GEO accession no. GPL2872, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) were used. They contain 60-mer DNA probes synthesized in situ in a 44k format. Of 44,290 spots, 2756 are controls. The remaining 41,534 spots represent 33,661 unique transcripts which correspond to 20,202 unique human genes. Five independent (five subthalamic nuclei from mice treated with cocaine compared to five subthalamic nuclei from mice treated with saline solution) hybridizations were carried out for each group of biological conditions using exchanged dye-labeled RNA targets (i.e., Cy3 and Cy5 dyeswapping experiments). Each hybridization was numerized hybridization by a GenePix 4000B Microarray Scanner and an Agilent G6525 Microarray Scanner .",

Neuroblastoma is a pediatric tumor of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system with a highly variable prognosis. Activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in neuroblastoma is correlated with poor patient prognosis, but the precise downstream effectors mediating this effect have not been determined. Here, we identify the forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a as a key target of the PI3K/AKT pathway in neuroblastoma. FOXO3a expression was elevated in low stage neuroblastoma tumors and normal embryonal neuroblasts, but reduced in late stage neuroblastoma. Inactivation of FOXO3a by AKT was essential for neuroblastoma cell survival. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103 activated FOXO3a and triggered apoptosis. This effect was rescued by FOXO3a silencing. Conversely, apoptosis induced by PI-103 or the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 was potentiated by FOXO3a overexpression. Further, levels of total or phosphorylated FOXO3a correlated closely with apoptotic sensitivity to MK-2206. In clinical specimens, there was an inverse relationship between gene expression signatures regulated by PI3K signaling and FOXO3a transcriptional activity. Moreover, high PI3K activity and low FOXO3a activity were each associated with an extremely poor prognosis. Our work indicates that expression of FOXO3a and its targets offer useful prognostic markers as well as biomarkers for PI3K/AKT inhibitor efficacy in neuroblastoma.

It is therefore conceivable that chromatin-borne information participates in alternative splicing. Here, we find that elevated levels of tri-methylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me3) are a characteristic of the alternative exons of several genes including CD44. On this gene, the chromodomain protein HP1gamma, frequently defined as a transcriptional repressor, facilitates inclusion of the alternative exons via a mechanism involving decreased RNA polymerase II elongation rate. In addition, accumulation of HP1gamma on the variant region of the CD44 gene stabilizes association of the pre-mRNA with the chromatin. Altogether, our data provide evidence for localized histone modifications impacting alternative splicing. They further implicate HP1gamma as a possible bridging molecule between the chromatin and the maturating mRNA, with a general impact on splicing decisions.

AIRmax and AIRmin mouse lines show a differential lung inflammatory response and differential lung tumor susceptibility after urethane treatment, thus constituting a good genetic model to investigate differences in gene expression profiles related to inflammatory response and lung tumor susceptibility. The transcript profile of ~24,000 known genes was analyzed in normal lung tissue of untreated and urethane-treated AIRmax and AIRmin mice. In lungs of untreated mice, inflammation associated genes involved in pathways such as \"leukocyte transendothelial migration\", \"cell adhesion\" and \"tight junctions\" were differentially expressed in AIRmax versus AIRmin mice. Moreover, gene expression levels differed significantly in urethane-treated mice even at 21 days after treatment. In AIRmin mice, modulation of expression of genes involved in pathways associated with inflammatory response paralleled the previously observed persistent infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lung of these mice. In conclusion, a specific gene expression profile in normal lung tissue is associated with mouse line susceptibility or resistance to lung tumorigenesis and with different inflammatory response, and urethane treatment causes a long-lasting alteration of the lung gene expression profile that correlates with persistent inflammatory response of AIRmin mice.

An improved mechanistic understanding of the thyroid hormone (TH) action on bile acid (BA) synthetic pathway, the major route for cholesterol elimination, will facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic targets for hypercholesterolemia. Here, we show that hepatic miR-378 is positively regulated by TH. Transient overexpression of miR-378 in the liver of mice reduces the serum cholesterol levels, which is accompanied with an upregulation of key enzymes involved in the intrahepatic conversion of cholesterol to BAs. Importantly, transgenic mice with liver-specific and moderate overexpression of miR-378 also display a decrease in serum cholesterol levels accompanied with an enhanced BA synthesis and are resistant to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. In contrast, mice lacking miR-378 exhibit an elevation of serum cholesterol levels accompanied with an impaired BA synthesis. Mechanistic studies reveal that hepatic miR-378 regulates BA synthesis and cholesterol homeostasis through its direct target gene MAFG, which is a transcriptional repressor of BA synthetic genes. We also show that miR-378 serves as an essential component in either incoherent or coherent feed-forward loop to confer robust and precise controls on BA synthesis in response to TH signalling. Together, we identify a previously undescribed miR-378-mediated mechanism underlying the cholesterol-lowering effect of TH. Our findings not only add a new dimension to our understanding the regulation of BA synthesis by TH, but also provide new therapeutic regimens to manage serum cholesterol levels.

Developmental pathways that orchestrate the fleeting transition of endothelial cells into haematopoietic stem cells remain undefined. Here we demonstrate a tractable approach for fully reprogramming adult mouse endothelial cells to haematopoietic stem cells (rEC-HSCs) through transient expression of the transcription-factor-encoding genes Fosb, Gfi1, Runx1, and Spi1 (collectively denoted hereafter as FGRS) and vascular-niche-derived angiocrine factors. The induction phase (days 0-8) of conversion is initiated by expression of FGRS in mature endothelial cells, which results in endogenous Runx1 expression. During the specification phase (days 8-20), RUNX1+ FGRS-transduced endothelial cells commit to a haematopoietic fate, yielding rEC-HSCs that no longer require FGRS expression. The vascular niche drives a robust self-renewal and expansion phase of rEC-HSCs (days 20-28). rEC-HSCs have a transcriptome and long-term self-renewal capacity similar to those of adult haematopoietic stem cells, and can be used for clonal engraftment and serial primary and secondary multi-lineage reconstitution, including antigen-dependent adaptive immune function. Inhibition of TGF? and CXCR7 or activation of BMP and CXCR4 signalling enhanced generation of rEC-HSCs.

Quiescent cells are widely reported to exhibit reduced size, nucleotide synthesis, and metabolic activity. Much lower glycolytic rates have been reported in quiescent compared with proliferating lymphocytes. In contrast, we show here that primary human fibroblasts continue to exhibit high metabolic rates when induced into quiescence via contact inhibition. By monitoring isotope labeling through metabolic pathways and quantitatively identifying fluxes from the data, we show that contact-inhibited fibroblasts utilize glucose in all branches of central carbon metabolism at rates similar to those of proliferating cells, with greater overflow flux from the pentose phosphate pathway back to glycolysis. Inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway resulted in apoptosis preferentially in quiescent fibroblasts. By feeding the cells labeled glutamine, we also detected a \"backwards\" flux in the tricarboxylic acid cycle from a-ketoglutarate to citrate that was enhanced in contact-inhibited fibroblasts; this flux likely contributes to shuttling of NADPH from the mitochondrion to cytosol for redox defense or fatty acid synthesis. The high metabolic activity of the fibroblasts was directed in part toward breakdown and resynthesis of protein and lipid, and in part toward excretion of extracellular matrix proteins. Thus, reduced metabolic activity is not a hallmark of the quiescent state. Quiescent fibroblasts, relieved of the biosynthetic requirements associated with generating progeny, direct their metabolic activity to preservation of self integrity and alternative functions beneficial to the organism as a whole. mRNAs were analyzed by two color microarray from two separate human neonatal dermal fibroblasts cell lines in proliferating, 7 days contact inhibition, or 14 days contact inhibition.

In order to obtain an overview of PPARalpha-regulated genes relevant to lipid metabolism, and to probe for novel candidate PPARalpha target genes, livers from several animal studies in which PPARalpha was activated and/or disabled were analyzed by Affymetrix GeneChips. Numerous novel PPARalpha-regulated genes relevant to lipid metabolism were identified. Out of this set of genes, eight genes were singled out for study of PPARalpha-dependent regulation in mouse liver and in mouse, rat, and human primary hepatocytes, including thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip), electron-transferring-flavoprotein beta polypeptide (Etfb), electron-transferring-flavoprotein dehydrogenase (Etfdh), phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (Pctp), endothelial lipase (EL, Lipg), adipose triglyceride lipase (Pnpla2), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL, Lipe), and monoglyceride lipase (Mgll).

The disease progression accelerates as glucose tolerance deteriorates suggesting that acquired factors contribute. To identify how environmental factors may lead to the expansion and pathogenicity of the diabetogenic T cells, we analyzed diabetogenic NRP-V7-reactive CD8+ T cells that recognize a peptide from the diabetes antigen IGRP in prediabetic NOD mice. There was an increase in the frequency of the NRP-V7-reactive cells coinciding with the time of glucose intolerance. The T cells persisted in hyperglycemic NOD mice maintained with an insulin pellet despite destruction of beta cells. We compared gene expression in the NRP-V7-reactive T cells to others that shared their phenotype but not selected for reactivity to diabetes antigens viral antigen reactive cells. Compared to these other cells, the NRP-V7-reactive cells exhibited gene expression of memory precursor effector cells. They had reduced cellular proliferation and were less dependent on oxidative phosphorylation.

OBF1, also known as Bob.1 or OCA-B, is a B lymphocyte-specific transcription factor which coactivates Oct1 and Oct2 on B cell specific promoters. So far, the function of OBF1 has been mainly identified in late stage B cell populations. The central defect of OBF1 deficient mice is a severely reduced immune response to T cell-dependent antigens and a lack of germinal center formation in the spleen. Relatively little is known about a potential function of OBF1 in developing B cells. Here we have generated transgenic mice overexpressing OBF1 in B cells under the control of the immunoglobulin heavy chain promoter and enhancer. Surprisingly, these mice have greatly reduced numbers of follicular B cells in the periphery and have a compromised immune response. Furthermore, B cell differentiation is impaired at an early stage in the bone marrow. A first block is observed during B cell commitment and a second differentiation block is seen at the large preB2 cell stage. The cells that succeed to escape the block and to differentiate into mature B cells have post-translationally downregulated the expression of transgene, indicating that expression of OBF1 beyond the normal level early in B cell development is deleterious. Indeed ID3, which is a negative regulator of B cell differentiation, is upregulated in the EPLM and preB cells of the transgenic mice. Furthermore ID3 promoter contains an octamer site suggesting that it is a potential OBF-1 direct target gene. These results provide evidence that OBF1 expression has to be tightly regulated in early B cells to allow efficient B lymphocyte differentiation.

In this first report, we examine the genome-wide chromatin localization of an altered-specificity mutant ER with a DNA-binding domain deficient in binding to estrogen response element (ERE)-containing DNA (DBDmut ER) vs. wild type ERa. Using high-throughput sequencing of ER chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP-Seq) and mRNA transcriptional profiling, we show that direct ERE binding is required for most (75%) estrogen-dependent gene regulation and 90% of hormone-dependent recruitment of ER to genomic binding sites. De novo motif analysis of the chromatin binding regions in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells defined unique transcription factor profiles responsible for genes regulated through tethering vs. direct DNA (ERE) binding, with Runx motifs enriched in ER-tethered sites. We confirmed a role for Runx1 in mediating ERa genomic recruitment and regulation of tethering genes. Our findings delineate the contributions of ERE binding vs. binding through response elements for other transcription factors in chromatin localization and ER-dependent gene regulation, paradigms likely to underlie the gene regulatory actions of other nuclear receptors as well.This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

    "text": "Liver-specific knockdown of class IIa HDACs has limited efficacy on glucose metabolism but entails severe organ side effects in mice. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are important regulators of epigenetic gene modification that are involved in the transcriptional control of metabolism. In particular class IIa HDACs have been shown to affect hepatic gluconeogenesis and previous approaches revealed that their inhibition reduces blood glucose in type 2 diabetic mice. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the potential of class IIa HDAC inhibition as a therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of metabolic diseases. For that, siRNAs selectively targeting HDAC4, 5 and 7 were selected and used to achieve a combinatorial knockdown of these three class IIa HDAC isoforms. Subsequently, the hepatocellular effects as well as the impact on glucose and lipid metabolism were analyzed in vitro and in vivo. The triple knockdown resulted in a statistically significant decrease of gluconeogenic gene expression in a murine hepatic cell line as well as in human primary hepatocytes. Despite a similar HDAC-induced downregulation of hepatic genes involved in gluconeogenesis in mice using a liver-specific lipid nanoparticle siRNA formulation, the in vivo effects on whole body glucose metabolism were only limited and did not outweigh the safety concerns observed by histopathological analysis in spleen and kidney. Mechanistically, Affymetrix gene chip analysis and gene expression studies provide evidence that class IIa HDACs directly target and thus regulate the expression of HNF4a and FOXP1 in the liver, thereby modifying gene regulatory mechanisms mediating glucose and lipid metabolism and transport. In conclusion, the combinatorial knockdown of HDAC4, 5 and 7 by therapeutic siRNAs affected multiple pathways in vitro and in vivo leading to the downregulation of genes involved in gluconeogenesis. However, the effects on the gene expression level were not paralleled by a significant reduction of gluconeogenesis in mice, as shown in pyruvate tolerance tests. However, the liver-specific inhibition of these HDAC isoforms was associated with severe adverse effects in vivo, making this approach not a viable treatment option for chronic metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes. Four different groups of HDAC siRNA treatments with 4 replicate samples each were compared to four replicate LV3 (scrambled siRNA) control samples.",

    "text": "Role of Branched Chain Amino Acid Transaminase 1 (BCAT1) in Acute Myeloid Leukemia [expression_BCAT1-KD #2]. The branched chain amino acid (BCAA) pathway and high levels of BCAA transaminase 1 (BCAT1) have recently been associated with aggressiveness in several cancer entities. However, the mechanistic role of BCAT1 in this process remains largely uncertain. By performing high-resolution proteomic analysis of human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) stem cell (LSC) and non-LSC populations, we found the BCAA pathway enriched and BCAT1 overexpressed in LSCs. We show that BCAT1, which transfers a-amino groups from BCAAs to a-ketoglutarate (aKG), is a critical regulator of intracellular aKG homeostasis. Next to its role in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle aKG is an essential co-factor for aKG-dependent dioxygenases such as EGLN1 and the TET family of DNA demethylases. Knockdown of BCAT1 in leukaemia cells caused accumulation of aKG leading to HIF1a protein degradation mediated by EGLN1. This resulted in a growth and survival defect and abrogated leukaemia-initiating potential. In contrast, overexpression (OE) of BCAT1 in leukaemia cells decreased intracellular aKG levels and caused DNA hypermethylation via altered TET activity. BCAT1high AMLs displayed a DNA hypermethylation phenotype similar to cases carrying mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDHmut), in which TET2 is inhibited by the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate. High levels of BCAT1 strongly correlate with shorter overall survival in IDHwtTET2wt, but not IDHmut or TET2mut AMLs. Gene sets characteristic for IDHmut AMLs were enriched in IDHwtTETwtBCAT1high patient samples. BCAT1high AMLs showed robust enrichment for LSC signatures and paired sample analysis revealed a significant increase of BCAT1 levels upon disease relapse. In summary, by limiting intracellular aKG, BCAT1 links BCAA catabolism to HIF1a stability and regulation of the epigenomic landscape. Our results suggest the BCAA-BCAT1-aKG pathway as a therapeutic target to compromise LSC function in IDHwtTET2wt AML patients. Primary AML samples were lentivirally transduced with shBCAT1-2 or shNT as control, transduced cells were FACS sorted 48 hrs after the transduction, cells were lysed and RNA was extracted.",

The identification of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) susceptibility genes by genome-wide association has linked this pathology to autophagy, a lysosomal degradation pathway that is crucial for cell and tissue homeostasis. Here, we describe autophagin-1 (ATG4B) as an essential protein in the control of inflammatory response during experimental colitis. In this pathological condition, ATG4B protein levels increase paralleling the induction of autophagy. Moreover, ATG4B expression is significantly reduced in affected areas of the colon from IBD patients. Consistently, atg4b-/- mice present Paneth cell abnormalities, as well as an increased susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis. Atg4b-deficient mice exhibit significant alterations in proinflammatory cytokines and mediators of the immune response to bacterial infections, which are reminiscent of those found in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Additionally, antibiotic treatments and bone marrow transplantation from wild-type mice reduced colitis in atg4b-/- mice. Taken together, these results provide additional evidence on the importance of autophagy in intestinal pathologies and describe ATG4B as a novel protective protein in inflammatory colitis. Finally, we propose that Atg4b-null mice are a suitable model for in vivo studies aimed at testing new therapeutic strategies for intestinal diseases associated with autophagy deficiency. Seven samples were collected in total: three from wild-type mice (1 from the ileum and the colon of control mice, and 1 from the colon of a DSS-treated mouse) and four from Atg4b knock-out mice (1 from the ileum and the colon of control mice, and 2 from the colon of DSS-treated mice).",

However, difficulty in the extraction of highly purified NPRs from normal nervous tissue prevents further studies and applications. In this study, we reported conversion of human fetal dermal fibroblasts into human induced neuronal restricted progenitors (hiNRPs) in seven days by using just three defined factors: Sox2, c-Myc, and either Brn2 or Brn4.

Mesodiencephalic dopaminergic (mdDA) neurons critically regulate locomotory behavior and emotion, and dysfunction is associated with psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's Disease (PD). A pathological hallmark of PD is the specific degeneration of Substantia Nigra (SN) neurons, whereas Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) neurons are relatively unaffected. Differential molecular programming of the developing SN versus VTA may underly this specific vulnerability, and indeed molecularly distinct mdDA subsets have been identified during development. Driven by the hypothesis that the molecular signature of the SN and VTA originates from differential developmental programming and position along the rostral/caudal axis, we performed genome-wide expression profiling of FACS-purified rostral versus caudal mdDA neurons. Here, we present the distinct transcriptomes of these mdDA subsets and demonstrate how, on a genome-wide scale: 1) transcription factor regulation relates to developmental position, 2) rostral and caudal mdDA neurons differ in their functional genome, 3) the molecular signature of rostral versus caudal mdDA neurons relates to the SN versus VTA molecular profile in adult mice and human and 4) human homologues of rostrally enriched genes are mostly downregulated in the SN of PD patients. Our analyses substantiate the relationship of developmental positions with the SN versus VTA distinction in adult, and suggest cross-species conservation of molecular programs. Driven by these observations, we present 69 target genes that are rostral enriched and downregulated in PD, and thus provide new leads for the investigation of both the complex coding of developing mdDA subsets and and the molecular mechanisms underlying subset-specific vulnerability in PD.

    "text": "Transcript variation in C57BL/6J mice under normal laboratory conditions. BACKGROUND: The transcript levels of many genes exhibit significant variation in tissue samples from inbred laboratory mice. A microarray experiment was designed to separate transcript abundance variation across samples from adipose, heart, kidney, and liver tissues of C57BL/6J mice into within-mouse and between-mouse components. Within-mouse variance captures variation due to heterogeneity of gene expression within tissues, RNA-extraction, and array processing. Between-mouse variance reflects differences in transcript levels between these genetically identical mice. Many biological sources can contribute to heterogeneous transcript levels within a tissue sample including inherent stochasticity of biochemical processes such as intrinsic and extrinsic noise within cells and differences in cell-type composition which can result from heterogeneity of stem and progenitor cell populations. Differences in global signaling patterns between individuals and micro-environmental influences such as interactions with pathogens and cage mates can also contribute to variation, but are likely to contribute more to the between-mouse variance component.RESULTS: The nature and extent of transcript abundance variation differs across tissues. Adipose has the largest total variance and the largest within-mouse variance. Liver has the smallest total variance, but it has the most between-mouse variation. Genes with high variability can be classified into groups with correlated patterns of expression that are enriched for specific biological functions. Variation between mice is associated with circadian rhythm, growth hormone signaling, immune response, androgen regulation, lipid metabolism, and the extracellular matrix. Genes showing correlated patterns of within mouse variation were also associated with biological functions, spatial connectivity of stochastic variation and heterogeneity of cell types within tissues.CONCLUSIONS: Genetically identical mice are individuals and they can experience different outcomes for medically important traits. This is reflected in the stochastic variation in gene expression observed between genetically identical mice. Much of the stochasticity has organismal, tissue, or spatial connectivity. Prior knowledge of the genes and functional classes of genes that are likely to vary in the absence of experimental perturbations, whether these are genetic or environmental, can inform experimental design decisions and the interpretation of gene expression data. Variation in gene expression in genetically identical mice sheds light on the impact of stochastic and micro-environmental factors and their phenotypic consequences. Four tissues were sampled from twelve 10-week old male mice. Six pairs of siblings were co-housed from weaning under uniform environmental conditions. From each mouse we obtained duplicate samples of adipose (inguinal fat pad), heart, kidney, and liver tissues by splitting whole organs or tissues prior to homogenization and RNA extraction. Adipose, heart, and liver tissues were coarsely cut into pieces and divided into two samples that were homogenized separately prior to RNA extraction. The left and right kidneys were processed separately. This sampling design allows us to partition the variance for each gene into within-mouse and between-mouse components, with a division line that corresponds to the step of splitting tissues.[Stochastic Variation of Transcript Abundance in C57BL/6J Mice]: The liver tissues were sampled from twelve 10-week old male mice.

A number of studies have provided some insights into the relationships between the two aspects of atherosclerosis: plasma lipids --- the risk factors, and circulating leukocytes --- the effectors of inflammation. In this study, we investigate the relationships between plasma lipids and leukocytes.Methods and Results---No significant correlation was found between leukocyte counts and plasma lipid levels in 74 individuals. Profiling and analyzing the leukocyte gene expression of 32 individuals revealed distinctive patterns in response to plasma lipid levels: 1) genes involved in lipid metabolism and in the electron transport chain were positively correlated with triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels; 2) genes involved in platelet activation were negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels; 3) transcription factors regulating lipidgenesis-related genes were correlated with plasma lipid levels; 4) a number of genes correlated to plasma lipid levels were found located in the regions of known QTLs associated with hyperlipemia. Conclusions--- We discovered interesting patterns of leukocyte gene expression in response to plasma lipid levels. Most importantly, genes involved in lipid metabolism, the electron transportation chain, and platelet activation were found correlated with plasma lipid levels. We suggest that leukocytes respond to changing plasma lipid levels by regulating a network of genes, including genes involved in lipid and fatty acid metabolism, through the activation of key transcription factors, such as sterol regulatory element binding transcription factors and peroxisome proliferative activated receptors.Keywords: Atherosclerosis, leukocyte, lipid, gene expression. 1.

Here, we demonstrate that aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity may be used for isolation of cells with progenitor-like characteristics from adult human renal cortical tissue. Gene expression profiling of the isolated ALDHhigh and ALDHlow cell fractions followed by immunohistochemical interrogation of renal tissues enabled us to delineate a tentative progenitor cell population with a scattered distribution in the epithelial layer of the proximal tubules (PT). The cells differed from the surrounding cells by expression of CD133, CD24, vimentin, KRT7, KRT19, and BCL2, and were negative for PT-specific markers. Based on functional and bioinformatic analyses as well as an immunophenotypical resemblance to cells of regenerating tubules we suggest that these cells are endowed with a more robust phenotype, allowing increased resistance to acute renal injury, enabling rapid repopulation of the tubules. The rare intratubular cells also displayed marked transcriptional and immunophenotypical similarities to that of cortical adenomas and papillary renal cell carcinomas, indicating that these renal neoplasms arise through oncogenic transformation of this subset of PT cells. Total RNA extracted from three pairs of ALDH-high and ALDH-low cell fractions were hybridized to Illumina humanHT-12 v3.0 Expression BeadChips (Illumina Inc) at the SCIBLU Genomics Centre at Lund University Sweden (http://www.lth.se/sciblu).",

Mammalian neurons express extra-long pre-mRNAs which are vulnerable to misregualtion of transcriptional elongation or processing but their regulation is still largely unknown. Here we found that RNA-binding protein PSF is specifically expressed in differentiated neuron of embryonic mouse brain and is essential for the expression of extra-long neuronal gene. HITS-CLIP indicated co-transcriptional binding of PSF to the nascent pre-mRNAs. When PSF was disrupted, pre-mRNA level of long genes was down-regulated in the middle of their transcripts toward their 3' ends. In Pol II ChIP-Seq, decrease of the RNA polymerase II density was observed parallel to pre-mRNAs, indicating that transcriptional elongation was impaired. Loss of PSF caused massive apoptosis in embryonic mouse brains and heterozygous PSF mutant mice displayed schizophrenia-like abnormal behaviors. Gene Ontology analysis demonstrated that PSF-regulated genes have essential functions at the late developmental stage of brains. Our findings indicate that PSF is required for the neuronal development through facilitating the transcriptional elongation of extra-long neuronal genes and dysfunction of PSF could be a cause of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.

Glis3 mutant mice (Glis3zf/zf) die within the first week after birth due to overt diabetes, evidenced by hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia. Histopathological analysis showed that Glis3zf/zf mice develop a pancreatic phenotype with a dramatic loss of beta- (insulin) and delta- (somatostatin) cells contrasting a smaller relative loss of alpha- (glucagon), PP- (pancreatic polypeptide), and epsilon- (ghrelin) cells. Glis3zf/zf mice develop ductal cysts with decreased number of primary cilia, while the acini are not significantly affected. Gene expression profiling by microarray analysis demonstrated that the expression of terminal hormonal genes and several transcription factors important in endocrine development were significantly deregulated in Glis3zf/zf mice. During pancreatic development, Glis3 mRNA expression is induced during the secondary transition, a stage of cell lineage specification and extensive patterning. Changes in pancreatic development of Glis3zf/zf mice are noted during and after this stage. The population of pancreatic progenitors appears not to be greatly affected in Glis3zf/zf mice; however, the number of neurogenin 3 (Ngn3) positive, endocrine progenitors is significantly reduced. Our study indicates that Glis3 plays a key role in cell lineage specification, particularly the development of mature pancreatic beta-cells. In addition, we identified evidence that Glis3 regulates insulin gene expression through two Glis-binding sites in its proximal promoter indicating that Glis3 is a regulator of insulin gene expression. .

MEIS2 has an important role in development and organogenesis, and is implicated in the pathogenesis of human cancer. The molecular basis of MEIS2 action in tumorigenesis is not clear. Here, we show that MEIS2 is highly expressed in human neuroblastoma cell lines and is required for neuroblastoma cell survival and proliferation. Depletion of MEIS2 in neuroblastoma cells leads to M phase arrest and mitotic catastrophe, whereas ectopic expression of MEIS2 markedly enhances neuroblastoma cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenicity. Gene expression profiling reveals an essential role of MEIS2 in maintaining the expression of a large number of late cell cycle genes, including those required for DNA replication, G2-M checkpoint control and M phase progression. Importantly, we identify MEIS2 as a transcription activator of the MuvB-BMYB-FOXM1 complex that functions as a master regulator of mitotic gene expression. Further, we show that FOXM1 is a direct target gene of MEIS2 and is required for MEIS2 to upregulate mitotic genes. These findings link a development gene to the control of cell cycle progression and suggest that high MEIS2 expression is a molecular mechanism for high expression of mitotic genes that is commonly observed in cancers of poor prognosis. Affymetrix microarray assays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on total RNA isolated from three independent samples of BE(2)-C cells infected with lentiviruses expressing either shGFP or shMEIS2-43 for 48 hours.",

The advent of human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells enables for the first time the derivation of unlimited numbers of patient-specific stem cells and holds great promise for regenerative medicine. However, realizing the full potential of iPS cells requires robust, precise and safe strategies for their genetic modification. Safe human iPS cell engineering is especially needed for therapeutic applications, as stem cell-based therapies that rely on randomly integrated transgenes pose oncogenic risks. Here we describe a strategy to genetically modify iPS cells from patients with beta-thalassemia in a potentially clinically relevant manner. Our approach is based on the identification and selection of \"safe harbor\" sites for transgene expression in the human genome. We show that thalassemia patient iPS cell clones harboring a transgene can be isolated and screened according to chromosomal position. We next demonstrate that iPS cell clones that meet our \"safe harbor\" criteria resist silencing and allow for therapeutic levels of beta-globin expression upon erythroid differentiation without perturbation of neighboring gene expression. Combined bioinformatics and functional analyses thus provide a robust and dependable approach for achieving desirable levels of transgene expression from selected chromosomal loci. This approach may be broadly applicable to introducing therapeutic or suicide genes into patient specific iPS cells for use in cell therapy. iPS cell clones were derived from beta-thalassemia patients. A single copy of beta-globin transgene cis-linked to locus control region (LCR) elements and an excisable Neo-eGFP transcription unit were inserted into these cell clones. beta-globin expression was induced by erythroid differentiation.",

Alterations of the cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction also contribute to those pathological settings. However, the functional interplay between EMT and cell-ECM interaction is poorly understood. Here, we show that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, a potent mediator of inflammation, induces EMT-associated fibrosis in retinal pigment epithelial cells, and that this is regulated by hyaluronan (HA)-CD44-Moesin interaction. TNF-a elicits both HA synthesis and Moesin phosphorylation through protein kinase C activation, promoting binding of CD44 to the newly synthesized HA. The HA-CD44-Moesin interaction leads to cell-cell dissociation through actin remodeling and increased cellular motility associated with mesenchymal phenotype. Furthermore, we established an in vivo model of TNF-a-induced fibrosis in the mouse eye, and the ocular fibrosis was completely suppressed in CD44-null mice. Therefore, HA production and its interaction with CD44 plays essential role in TNF-a-induced-EMT, and the interference of the complex formation can be a new strategy for the fibrotic disorders. ARPE19 cell lines were treated with TGF and TNF for 6 and 42 hour. Each experiment were repeated three times.

Lacrimal glands of female BALB/c mice were experimentally injured by intra-glandular injection of interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1a). The lacrimal glands were harvested at various time points following injury (1 to 14 days) and used to either prepare single cell suspensions for CyTOF immuno-phenotyping analyses or to extract RNA for gene expression studies using RNA-Seq. CyTOF immuno-phenotyping identified monocytes and neutrophils as the major infiltrating populations 1 and 2 days post injury. Clustering of significantly differentially expressed genes identified 13 distinct molecular signatures: 3 associated with immune/inflammatory processes included genes up-regulated at days 1-2 and 3 associated with reparative processes with genes up-regulated primarily between days 4 and 5. Finally, clustering identified 65 genes which were specifically up-regulated 2 days post injury which was enriched for muscle specific genes. The expression of select muscle-related proteins was confirmed by immunohistochemistry which identified a subset of cells expressing these proteins. Double staining experiments showed that these cells are distinct from the myoepithelial cells. We conclude that experimentally induced injury to the lacrimal gland leads to massive infiltration by neutrophils and monocytes which resolved after 3 days. RNAseq and immunohistochemistry identified a group of cells, other than myoepithelial cells, that express muscle-related proteins that could play an important role in lacrimal gland repair.

Background and Aims: RNA biomarkers derived from sloughed enterocytes would provide an ideal, non-invasive method for early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) and precancerous adenomas. To realize this goal, a highly reliable method to isolate preserved human RNA from stool samples is needed. Here we develop a protocol to identify RNA biomarkers associated with CRC to assess the use of these biomarkers for noninvasive screening of disease.Methods: Stool samples were collected from 454 patients prior to a colonoscopy. A nucleic acid extraction protocol was developed to isolate human RNA from 330 stool samples and transcript abundances were estimated by microarray analysis. This 330-patient cohort was split into a training set of 265 individuals to develop a machine learning model and a testing set of 65 individuals to determine the model's ability to detect colorectal neoplasms.Results: Analysis of the transcriptome from 265 individuals identified 200 transcript clusters as differentially expressed (p<0.03). These transcripts were used to build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based model to classify 65 individuals within the testing set. This SVM algorithm attained a 95% sensitivity for precancerous adenomas and a 65% sensitivity for CRC (stage I-IV). The machine learning algorithm attained a specificity of 59% for healthy individuals and an overall accuracy of 72.3%.Conclusions: We developed an RNA-based neoplasm detection model that is sensitive for CRC and precancerous adenomas. The model allows for non-invasive assessment of tumors and could potentially be used to provide clinical guidance for individuals within the screening population for colorectal cancer. Total RNA was isolated from 338 stool samples and the transcriptome was assessed using the Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0. Differentially expressed genes were identified using the transcript fold change between healthy and diseased individuals. These transcriptomes were used to build a machine learning algorithm to classify individuals as diseased or not diseased.Reference samples are 'normal,' cases are 'adenomas' or 'cancer'.",

The spinal cord and mesodermal tissues of the trunk such as the vertebral column and skeletal musculature derive from neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs). Sox2, Brachyury (T) and Tbx6 have been correlated with NMP potency and lineage choice, however, their exact role and interaction in these processes have not been revealed yet. Here we present a global analysis of NMPs and their descending lineages performed on purified cells from E8.5 wild-type and mutant embryos. We show that T, cooperatively with WNT signaling, controls the progenitor state and the switch towards the mesodermal fate. Sox2 acts antagonistically and promotes neural development. Tbx6 reinforces the mesodermal fate choice, represses the progenitor state and confers paraxial fate commitment. Our findings refine previous models and establish new concepts of the molecular principles of mammalian trunk development comprising NMP maintenance, lineage choice and mesoderm formation. Bulk transcriptomes (RNA-Seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq) from T/Sox2 expressing subpopulations isolated during trunk development from wildtype and T knock-out mouse embryos. Data is supplemented by Fluidigm single-cell RNA-Seq for T/Sox2 co-expressing cells from wildtype embryos and a bulk RNA-Seq comparison of wildtype and Tbx6 knock-out mouse embryos. ChIP-Seq for T, Sox2, Tbx6 and beta-catenin has been performed with chromatin from in vitro differentiated neuromesodermal progenitors and presomitic mesoderm.",

Despite decades of clinical use, mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance are poorly understood. We treated primary murine T lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs) with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) alone and in combination with the pan-PI3 kinase inhibitor GDC-0941 and observed a robust response to DEX that was modestly enhanced by GDC-0941. Continuous in vivo treatment invariably resulted in outgrowth of drug-resistant clones, ~30% of which showed markedly reduced glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein expression. A similar proportion of relapsed human T-ALLs also exhibited low GR protein levels. De novo or pre-existing mutations in the gene encoding GR (Nr3c1) occurred in relapsed clones derived from multiple independent parental leukemias. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing confirmed that loss of GR expression confers DEX resistance. Exposing drug-sensitive T-ALLs to DEX in vivo altered transcript levels of multiple genes, and this response was attenuated in relapsed T-ALLs.

Factors which contribute to the adipocyte differentiation and function would be the promising targets to combat the obesity and associated metabolic disorders. The activating transcription factor 7 (ATF7), a stress-responsive chromatin regulator, has recently been shown to be involved in the energy metabolism; however, the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we show that ATF7 is required for adipocyte differentiation and it interacts with histone dimethyltransferase G9a in adipocyte to repress the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression, which suppresses adipogenesis. Ablation of ATF7 promotes the beige biogenesis and browning of inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT). ATF7 binds to the transcription regulatory regions of Ucp1 gene, and silences it by maintaining the histone H3K9 dimethylation level. These results establish the multifunction of ATF7 in adipocyte and provide molecular insights into the epigenetic control of development and function of adipose tissues.We used microarrays to identify the differentatial expression genes in the inguinal white adipose tissue of ATF7 KO mice.

Class-switch recombination (CSR), induced by activation-induced cytidine deaminase, can be divided into two phases: DNA cleavage of the switch (S) regions, and the joining of the cleaved ends of the different S regions. Here, we show that the DSIF complex (Spt4 and Spt5), a transcription elongation factor, is required for CSR in CH12F3-2A cells, and Spt4 and Spt5, carry out independent functions in CSR. Depleting Spt5 reduced the H3K4me3 levels and DNA cleavage at the Sa region, whereas Spt4 knockdown did not perturb the H3K4me3 status or S region cleavage. Thus, we conclude that Spt5 plays a role similar to the histone chaperone FACT by regulating histone modification and DNA cleavage in CSR. Assay systems using synthetic repair substrates revealed that both Spt4 and Spt5 are required for non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination. Taken together, Spt4 and Spt5 are involved in multiple CSR steps, and can function independently. Spt4 or Spt5 were knocked down in CH12F3-2A cells in the presence of CD40L, IL4, TGFb (CIT) stimulation.

The model employed chemical carcinogens and partial hepatectomy to induce progenitor marker-positive HCC. Rats were administered the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin for a three week period and liver harvested one month following cessation of rapamycin treatment. Short-term rapamycin treatment resulted in a significant reduction of focal lesion burden. Microarray analysis was performed to characterize the gene expression signature of persistent focal lesions in the rapamcyin and placebo treated animals. This analysis revealed a persistent effect of short-term mTORC1 inhibition on gene expression that resulted in a genetic signature reminiscent of normal liver. Laser capture microdissection was performed to specifically isolate persistent focal lesions from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) liver sections derived from triplicate placebo and rapamycin treated rats. In addition, we captured liver tissue from FFPE sections derived from rats that had been administered 2-acetylaminofluorene in combination with 2/3 partial hepatectomy to induce oval cell proliferation and from normal adult rats.

The overexpression of transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc reprograms a somatic nucleus to one that is transcriptionally and epigenetically indistinguishable from an embryonic stem (ES) cell. However, it is still unclear if transcription factors can completely convert the nucleus of a differentiated cell into that of a distantly related cell type such that it maintains complete transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming in the absence of exogenous factor expression. To test this idea, we screened a library of doxycycline-inducible vectors encoding neural stem cell (NSC)-expressed genes and found that stable, self-maintaining NSC-like cells could be induced under defined growth conditions after transduction of transcription factors. These induced NSCs (iNSCs) were characterized in the absence of exogenous factor induction and were shown to be transcriptionally, epigenetically, and functionally similar to endogenous embryonic cortical NSCs. Importantly, iNSCs could be generated from multiple adult cell types including liver cells and B-cells with genetic rearrangements. Our results show that self-maintaining proliferative neural cells can be induced from non-ectodermal cells by expressing specific combinations of transcription factors. Expression analysis was performed on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), primary-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) and induced neural stem cells (iNSCs).",

Although stromal cells are known to regulate cancer progression, oncogene-dependent signalling through heterocellular cancer systems remains poorly elucidated. Here, we describe KRASG12D-dependent 'reciprocal' signalling across tumor and stromal Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDA) cells. Heterocellular multivariate phosphoproteomics demonstrates how an oncogenic cue (KRASG12D), a trans-cellular signal (SHH), and stromal cells drive a reciprocal response in tumor cells. KRASG12D-dependent reciprocal signalling regulates the tumor cell phosphoproteome, total proteome, and mitochondria activity via an IGFR1/AXL-AKT axis. The reciprocal KRASG12D signalling state requires a heterocellular context and is unreachable by cell-autonomous oncogenic KRAS alone. These findings provide evidence that oncogenic KRAS regulates tumor cells via heterocellular reciprocation.

The interplay between the inflammatory infiltrate and tissue resident cell populations (e.g. epithelial cells, fibroblasts and macrophages) invokes fibrogenesis. However, the temporal and mechanistic contributions of these cell populations to fibrosis remain poorly defined. To address this issue, liver inflammation, ductular reaction (DR) and fibrosis were induced in C57BL/6 mice by thioacetamide (TAA) administration for up to 12 weeks. TAA treatment induced two phases of liver fibrosis. A rapid peri-central inflammatory infiltrate enriched in F4/80+ monocytes co-localized with SMA+ myofibroblasts resulted in early collagen deposition, marking the start of an initial fibrotic phase (1-6 weeks). An expansion of bone marrow derived macrophages proceeded a second phase, characterized by accelerated progression of fibrosis (> 6 weeks) followed the migration of the DR from the portal tracts to the centrilobular site of injury, in association an increase in DR/macrophage interactions. Although CCL2 mRNA was rapidly induced in response to TAA, CCL2 deficiency only partially abrogated fibrosis. In contrast, CSF-1R blockade diminished CCR2neg (Ly6Clo) monocytes, attenuated the DR and significantly reduced fibrosis, illustrating the critical role of CSF-1 dependent monocyte/macrophage differentiation and linking the two phases of injury. We demonstrate that in response to liver injury, CSF-1 drives early monocyte mediated myofibroblast activation and collagen deposition, subsequent macrophage differentiation and their association with the advancing DR, the formation of fibrotic septa and the progression of liver fibrosis to cirrhosis.

    "text": "Gene Expression Profiling of Whole Blood: Comparison of target preparation methods. Peripheral blood is an accessible and informative source of transcriptomal information for many human disease and pharmacogenomic studies. While there can be significant advantages to analyzing RNA isolated from whole blood, particularly in clinical studies, the preparation of samples for microarray analysis is complicated by the need to minimize artifacts associated with highly abundant globin RNA transcripts. The impact of globin RNA transcripts on expression profiling data can potentially be reduced by using RNA preparation and labeling methods that remove or block globin RNA during the microarray assay. We compared four different methods for preparing microarray hybridization targets from human whole blood collected in PAXGene tubes. Three of the methods utilized the Affymetrix one-cycle cDNA synthesis/in vitro transcription protocol but varied treatment of input RNA as follows: i. no treatment; ii. treatment with GLOBINclear; or iii. treatment with globin PNA oligos. In the fourth method cDNA targets were prepared with the Ovation amplification and labeling system.Results: We find that microarray targets generated with labeling methods that reduce globin mRNA levels or minimize the impact of globin transcripts during hybridization detect more transcripts in the microarray assay compared with the standard Affymetrix method. Comparison of microarray results with quantitative PCR analysis of a panel of genes from the NF-kappa B pathway shows good correlation of transcript measurements produced with all four target preparation methods, although method-specific differences in overall correlation were observed. The impact of freezing blood collected in PAXGene tubes on data reproducibility was also examined. Expression profiles show little or no difference when RNA is extracted from either fresh or frozen blood samples.Conclusion: RNA preparation and labeling methods designed to reduce the impact of globin mRNA transcripts can significantly improve the sensitivity of the DNA microarray expression profiling assay for whole blood samples. While blockage of globin transcripts during first strand cDNA synthesis with globin PNAs resulted in the best overall performance in this study, we conclude that selection of a protocol for expression profiling studies in blood should depend on several factors, including implementation requirements of the method and study design. RNA isolated from either freshly collected or frozen blood samples stored in PAXGene tubes can be used without altering gene expression profiles.Keywords: Whole Blood, Protocol Variation, Expression Profiling, Microarray, globin, PAXGene, PNA. Blood samples were collected from healthy, human donors in PAXGene tubes; RNA was isolated either on day of collection or after freezing and storage. Four different methods of microarray target preparation for whole blood RNA samples were examined. Three of the methods used total RNA extracted from whole blood as the starting sample for mRNA amplification and target labeling: Affymetrix one-cycle target labeling (Method 1: no depletion_Affymetrix); Affymetrix one-cycle target labeling with globin PNAs added during cDNA synthesis (Method 2: Globin PNAs_Affymetrix); and NuGEN Ovation system v1 (Method 4: no depletion_NuGEN). In the other method tested, total RNA was treated with Ambion GLOBINclear to reduce globin transcripts prior to labeling with the Affymetrix one-cycle labeling protocol (Method 3: GLOBINclear_Affymetrix). The Affymetrix one-cycle target labeling protocol produces biotin-labeled, amplified cRNA; the NuGEN protocol produces biotin-labeled, amplified cDNA targets. The analysis of this study included 24 total samples, with three biological replicates per sample storage state (fresh/frozen) and labeling method (Methods 1 - 4).",

Inhibitors of the MAPKs, BRAF and MEK, induce tumor regression in the majority of patients with BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma. The clinical benefit of MAPK inhibitors is restricted by the development of acquired resistance with half of those who benefit having progressed by 6-7 months and long-term responders uncommon. There remains no agreed treatment strategy on disease progression in these patients. Without published evidence, fears of accelerated disease progression on inhibitor withdrawal have led to the continuation of drugs beyond formal disease progression. We now demonstrate that treatment with MAPK inhibitors beyond disease progression can provide significant clinical benefit, and the withdrawal of these inhibitors led to a marked increase in the rate of disease progression in two patients. We also show that MAPK inhibitors retain partial activity in acquired resistant melanoma by examining drug-resistant clones generated to dabrafenib, trametinib or the combination of these drugs. All resistant sublines displayed a markedly slower rate of proliferation when exposed to MAPK inhibitors, and this coincided with a reduction in MAPK signalling, decrease in BrdU incorporation and S-phase inhibition. This cytostatic effect was also associated diminished levels of cyclin D1 and p-pRb.. Two short-term melanoma cultures generated from resistant tumour biopsies also responded to MAPK inhibition with comparable inhibitory changes in proliferation and MAPK signalling. These data provide a rationale for the continuation of BRAF and MEK inhibitors after disease progression and support the development of clinical trials to examine this strategy.

To identify potential receptors for sFNDC4 we screened a population of immortalized stromovascular mouse cells derived from inguinal white fat for cells, which showed high (high binding cells-HBC) or low binding (low binding cells-LBC) to recombinant FcsFNDC4.We utilised microarray to identify differentially expressed genes between HBC and LBC.

The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is a highly successful intracellular pathogen, owing in part to its ability to subvert the host immune system. In particular, parasite infection suppresses STAT1 signaling in a variety of cell types, including IFN-g activated macrophages, via a block within the nucleus. A high-throughput screen to identify genes able to overcome parasite-mediated suppression of STAT1 activity identified 9 transcription factors as enhancers of STAT1 signaling in T. gondii infected cells, including the orphan nuclear hormone receptor TLX. Expression profiling revealed that TLX is a transcriptional regulator that drives the steady-state expression of STAT1-independent genes involved brain function and development, while enhancing the output of a subset of IFN-g-dependent target genes. Infection of TLX deficient mice with Toxoplasma results in impaired production of interleukin-12 by dendritic cells and increased parasite burden in the brain during chronic infection. These results demonstrate a previously unrecognized function for this orphan nuclear hormone receptor in regulating STAT1 signaling and host defense, and reveal that STAT1 activity can be modulated in a context-specific manner by such 'modifiers'.

Microvascular endothelial cells (EC) are increasingly recognized as organ-specific gatekeepers of their microenvironment. Microvascular EC instruct neighboring cells in their organ-specific vascular niches by angiocrine factors that comprise secreted growth factors/angiokines, but also extracellular matrix molecules and transmembrane proteins. The molecular regulators, however, that drive organ-specific microvascular transcriptional programs and thereby regulate angiodiversity, are largely elusive. Opposite to continuous barrier-forming EC, liver sinusoids are a prime model of discontinuous, permeable micro-vessels. Here, we show that transcription factor GATA4 controls liver sinusoidal endothelial (LSEC) specification and function. LSEC-restricted deletion of GATA4 caused transformation of discontinuous liver sinusoids into continuous capillaries. Capillarization was characterized by ectopic basement membrane deposition and formation of an abundantly VE-Cadherin expressing continuous endothelium. Correspondingly, ectopic expression of GATA4 in cultured continuous EC mediated downregulation of continuous EC transcripts and upregulation of LSEC genes. Regarding angiocrine functions, the switch from discontinuous LSEC to continuous EC during embryogenesis caused liver hypoplasia, fibrosis, and impaired colonization by hematopoietic progenitor cells resulting in anemia and embryonic lethality. Thus, GATA4 acts as master regulator of hepatic microvascular specification and acquisition of organ-specific vascular competence indispensable for liver development. The data also establish an essential role of the hepatic microvasculature for embryonic hematopoiesis. bEnd3 cells were transduced with mouse Gata4 or empty vector for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.",

    "text": "Expression data of genes that regulate reactive oxygen species in bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. Although anemia is common in Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We asked whether SBDS, which is mutated in most SDS patients, is critical for erythroid development. We found that SBDS expression is high early during erythroid differentiation. Inhibition of SBDS in CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells and early progenitors (HSC/Ps) and K562 cells led to slow cell expansion during erythroid differentiation. Induction of erythroid differentiation resulted in markedly accelerated apoptosis in the knockdown cells; however, proliferation was only mildly reduced. The percentage of cells entering differentiation was not reduced.Differentiation also increased the oxidative stress in SBDS-knockdown K562 cells, and antioxidants enhanced the expansion capability of differentiating SBDS-knockdown K562 cells and colony production of SDS patient HSC/Ps. Erythroid differentiation also resulted in reduction of all ribosomal subunits and global translation. Furthermore, stimulation of global translation with leucine improved the erythroid cell expansion of SBDS-knockdown cells and colony production of SDS patient HSC/Ps. Leucine did not reduce the oxidative stress in SBDS-deficient K562 cells. These results demonstrate that SBDS is critical for normal erythropoiesis. Erythropoietic failure caused by SBDS-deficiency is at least in part related to elevated ROS levels and translation insufficiency since antioxidants and leucine improved cell expansion. Bone marrow mononuclear cells from nine SDS patients and nine control patients were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.",

Purpose: To determine the optimal RNA extraction and library generation protocols for mouse hippocampal tissue acquired by laser capture microdissection (LCM).Methods: Hippocampal subregion CA2 was captured from eight micron fresh frozen brain sections from AMIGO2 EGFP mice. Total RNA was extracted using the PicoPure (LCM standard) and QIAGEN micro RNeasy RNA extraction kits. RNA quantity and quality was assessed using a Bioanalzyer. Resulting RNA was used to generate cDNA libraries using NuGEN or SMARTer low input RNA-Seq library kits. We compared the effects of RNA quality and library generation approach to determine the methods that detected the greatest number of genes/exons with even coverage using minimal rounds of PCR.Results: We determined that the QIAGEN RNA extraction kit resulted in far superior RNA compared to the Picopure RNA extraction kit. We also found the NuGEN library generation kit that depletes ribosomal RNA towards the end of the protocol, led to higher cDNA library yields that required fewer rounds of PCR while providing even gene coverage and detection. RNA from laser-captured tissue from mouse hippocampus was extracted using two low input methods generating a lower quality RNA sample (RIN 7, PicoPure) and higher quality sample (RIN 9, QIAGEN). Each sample was used to prepare cDNA using two commerically available low-input library generation methods (Clontech or NuGEN). The effect of RNA quality and library generation method were compared. The effect of shearing cDNA and PCR amplification were also tested for libraries made with the QIAGEN extracted RNA and NuGEN library kits (3 libraries, 16, 18 or 20 cycles of PCR).

Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-activated transcription factors regulating a large variety of processes involved in reproduction, development, and metabolism. NRs are ideal drug targets. Immortalized cell lines recapitulate NR biology very poorly and primary cultures are laborious and require a constant need for donor material. There is a clear need for development of novel preclinical model systems that better resemble human physiology since technical uncertainty early in drug development is the cause of many preclinical drugs not reaching the clinic. Here, we studied whether organoids, mini-organs derived from the respective tissue's stem cells, can serve as a novel (preclinical) model system to study NR biology and targeteability. We characterized mRNA expression profiles of the NR superfamily in mouse liver, ileum, and colon organoids. NR mRNA expression patterns were similar to the respective tissues, indicating their suitability for NR research. Metabolic NRs Fxra, Lxra, Lxrb, Ppara, and Pparg were responsive to ligands in an NR-dependent fashion, as demonstrated by regulation of expression and binding to endogenous target genes. Transcriptome analyses of wildtype colonic organoids stimulated with Rosiglitazone showed that lipid metabolism was the highest significant changed function, greatly mimicking the known function of PPARs and Rosiglitazone in vivo. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that organoids constitutes a versatile and promising in vitro system to study NR biology and targeteability. Microarray analysis was performed on colonic organoids isolated from wildtype and intestinal epithelium-specific PPARg mice that were treated with the PPARg agonist Rosiglitazone or vehicle for 24 hrs.",

Here, we analyse the methylome of APCM in mouse intestinal adenoma as a model of intestinal cancer initiation, and inventory a map of over 13,000 adenoma-specific recurrent differentially methylated regions (DMRs). We find that multiple genes coding for Polycomb proteins are upregulated in adenoma, and concomitantly, hypermethylated DMRs form preferentially at Polycomb target sites. We establish that DMRs are absent from proliferating intestinal epithelial cells or intestinal stem cells, and thus arise de novo after loss of APC. Importantly, a core set of DMRs is conserved in human colon cancer, defining a class of early epigenetic alterations that are distinct from known sets of epigenetically silenced tumour suppressors. The data presented suggests a sequence of events that leads to an altered methylome of colon cancer cells, and may allow more specific selection of clinical epigenetic biomarkers.

Inflammatory disorders including arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and multiple sclerosis are characterised by the excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines resulting in inflammation, tissue damage and chronic pain.In a healthy immune system, the host has developed mechanisms to protect itself from excessive inflammation. One such mechanism is mediated by the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which primarily acts to limit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antigen presenting capabilities of cells in the innate immune system. Since the discovery of IL-10, much emphasis has been placed on extrapolating its exact mechanism of inhibition with the aim of potentiating its use therapeutically. Significantly, the systemic administration of IL-10 has had success in many animal models of inflammation as well as clinical success in human disorders such as psoriasis and Crohn's disease. Despite this, major gaps in our knowledge remain which have weakened the expected therapeutic effect for this anti-inflammatory cytokine.Our early studies discovered that in response to innate immune stimulation, IL-10 can potently inhibit miR-155 (McCoy et al., 2010), a miRNA characterised as a promoter of inflammation and found over-expressed in autoimmune pathologies. This finding suggests that the IL-10/miR-155 axis is a novel mechanism utilised by IL-10 to administer its function.

An early hallmark of Toxoplasma gondii infection is the rapid control of the parasite population by a potent multifaceted innate immune response that engages resident and homing immune cells along with pro- and counter-inflammatory cytokines. In this context, IFN-g activates a variety of T. gondii-targeting activities in immune and nonimmune cells but can also contribute to host immune pathology. T. gondii has evolved mechanisms to timely counteract the host IFN-g defenses by interfering with the transcription of IFN-g-stimulated genes. We now have identified TgIST (T. gondii inhibitor of STAT1 transcriptional activity) as a critical molecular switch that is secreted by intracellular parasites and traffics to the host cell nucleus where it inhibits STAT1-dependent proinflammatory gene expression. We show that TgIST not only sequesters STAT1 on dedicated loci but also promotes shaping of a nonpermissive chromatin through its capacity to recruit the nucleosome remodeling deacetylase (NuRD) transcriptional repressor. We found that during mice acute infection, TgIST-deficient parasites are rapidly eliminated by the homing Gr1+ inflammatory monocytes, thus highlighting the protective role of TgIST against IFN-g-mediated killing. By uncovering TgIST functions, this study brings novel evidence on how T. gondii has devised a molecular weapon of choice to take control over a ubiquitous immune gene expression mechanism in metazoans, as a way to promote long-term parasitism.

To identify E protein domains and host responses that contribute to rSARS-CoV-MA15-DE attenuation, several mutants (rSARS-CoV-MA15-E*) containing point mutations or deletions in the amino-terminal or the carboxy-terminal regions of E protein, respectively, were generated. Amino acid substitutions in the amino terminus, or deletion of domains in the internal carboxy terminal region of E protein led to viral attenuation. Attenuated viruses induced minimal lung injury and limited neutrophil influx to the lungs but, interestingly, increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts in BALB/c mice. To analyze the host responses leading to rSARS-CoV-MA15-E* attenuation, the differential gene expression elicited by the native virus and the mutant ones in infected cells was analyzed. The expression levels of a large number of proinflammatory cytokines inducing lung injury was reduced in the lungs of rSARS-CoV-MA15-E* infected mice, whereas the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines were increased, both at the mRNA and protein levels.

In this study, we revealed a role for Tet2 in sustaining the immunosuppressive function of tumor-tissue myeloid cells. We found that Tet2 expression is increased in intratumoral myeloid cells both in mouse models of melanoma and in melanoma patients, and that this increased expression is dependent on an IL-1R-MyD88 pathway. Ablation of Tet2 in myeloid cells suppressed melanoma growth in vivo, and shifted the immunosuppressive gene expression program in tumor-associated macrophages to a proinflammatory one, with a concomitant reduction of the immunosuppressive function. This resulted in increased numbers of effector T cells in the tumor, and T cell depletion abolished the reduced tumor growth observed upon myeloid-specific deletion of Tet2. Our findings reveal a non-cell-intrinsic, tumor-promoting function for Tet2, and suggest that Tet2 may present a therapeutic target for the treatment of non-hematologic malignancies.

Acquisition and maintenance of vascular smooth muscle fate is essential for the morphogenesis and function of the circulatory system. Loss of contractile properties or changes in the identity of vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMC) can result in structural alterations associated with aneurysms and vascular wall calcifications. Here we report that maturation of sclerotome-derived vSMC is dependent on a transcriptional switch between mouse embryonic days 13 and 14.5. At this time point, Jag1-mediated repression of sclerotome transcription factors Pax1, scleraxis and Sox9 is necessary to fully enable vSMC maturation. Specifically, Notch signaling in vSMC antagonizes sclerotome and cartilage transcription factors, and promotes upregulation of contractile genes. In the absence of Jag1, vSMC acquire a chondrocytic transcriptional repertoire that can lead to ossification of the vascular wall. Importantly, our findings suggest that sustained Notch signaling is essential throughout vSMC life to maintain contractile function, prevent vSMC reprogramming and promote vascular wall integrity. mRNA profile of vSMC from the descending aorta of 14.5 embryos Wild type (WT), SMC Jag1-heterozygous (HTZ) and SMC Jag1-null (KO) was generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate.",

We present a novel integrated computational and experimental approach to identify direct targets of a transcription factor. This consists in measuring time-course (dynamic) gene expression profiles upon perturbation of the transcription factor under study, and in applying a novel reverse-engineering\" algorithm (TSNI) to rank genes according to their probability of being direct targets. Using primary keratinocytes as a model system, we identified novel transcriptional target genes of Trp63, a crucial regulator of skin development. TSNI-predicted Trp63 target genes were validated by Trp63 knockdown and by ChIP-chip to identify Trp63-bound regions in vivo. Our study revealed that short sampling times, in the order of minutes, are needed to capture the dynamics of gene expression in mammalian cells. We show that Trp63 transiently regulates a subset of its direct targets, thus highlighting the importance of considering temporal dynamics when identifying transcriptional targets. Using this approach, we uncovered a previously unsuspected transient regulation of the AP-1 complex by Trp63, through direct regulation of a subset of AP-1 components. The integrated experimental and computational approach described here is readily applicable to other transcription factors in mammalian systems and is complementary to genome-wide identification of transcription factor binding sites.Keywords: time course, p63, keratinocytes.

Fibroblasts within the mammary tumor microenvironment are active participants in carcinogenesis mediating both tumor initiation and progression. Our group has previously demonstrated that genetic loss of PTEN in mammary fibroblasts induces an oncogenic secretome that remodels the extracellular milieu accelerating ErbB2-driven mammary tumor progression. While these prior studies highlighted a tumor suppressive role for stromal PTEN, how the adjacent normal epithelium transforms in response to PTEN loss was not previously addressed. To identify these early events, we have evaluated both phenotypic and genetic changes within the pre-neoplastic mammary epithelium of mice with and without stromal PTEN expression. We report that fibroblast-specific PTEN deletion greatly restricts mammary ductal elongation and induces aberrant alveolar side-branching. These mice concomitantly exhibit an expansion of the mammary epithelial stem cell (MaSC) enriched basal/myoepithelial population and further genome wide expression analysis followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that NOTCH signaling is diminished in these cells. NOTCH3 was confirmed to be downregulated in the MaSC-enriched pool by confirmatory qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence. Mechanistically, JAGGED-1, a transmembrane ligand for the NOTCH receptor, is downregulated in the PTEN-null fibroblasts leading to a loss in the paracrine activation of NOTCH signaling from the surrounding stroma.

The zebrafish has proven to be a versatile and valuable model for investigating the molecular and cellular basis of Fragile X syndrome (FXS). Reduction of expression of the zebrafish FMR1-ortholgous gene, fmr1, causes developmental and behavioural phenotypes related to the human syndrome. The hu2787 nonsense mutation allele of fmr1 is now the most widely used zebrafish model of FXS, although the FXS-relevant phenotypes seen from morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (morpholino) suppression of fmr1 transcript translation were not observed when this allele was first described. The subsequent discovery of genetic compensation, whereby morpholino-directed knockdown can give a more \"pure\" loss-of-function phenotype while mutations causing nonsense mediated decay of transcripts cause compensatory upregulation of homologous transcripts, suggested an explanation for the differences observed. To test for molecular evidence of genetic compensation in fmr1hu2787 homozygous mutants, we compared the transcriptomes of homozygous mutant and wild type larvae at 2 days post fertilisation. We observed statistically significant changes in the expression of a number of gene transcripts, but none with sequence homology to fmr1. Curiously, the majority of differentially expressed genes are located, like fmr1, on chromosome 14. Quantitative PCR tests on genomic DNA did not support that the apparent expression differences were artefacts due to changes in relative chromosome abundance. The coordinate dysregulation of chromosome 14 genes due to mutation of fmr1 supports this gene's involvement in a chromosome-wide gene regulation complex. Four clutches of zebrafish embryos were obtained from pair-matings of zebrafish homozygous for the hu2787 allele of fmr1. Another four clutches of zebrafish embryos were obtained from wild-type zebrafish. Each clutch was derived from a different pair of parents.",

Embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal and differentiation are governed by a broad-ranging regulatory network. Although the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms involved have been investigated extensively, post-transcriptional regulation is still poorly understood. Here we describe a critical role of the THO complex in ESC self-renewal and differentiation. We show that THO preferentially interacts with pluripotency gene transcripts through Thoc5, and is required for self-renewal at least in part by regulating their export and expression. During differentiation, THO loses its interaction with those transcripts due to reduced Thoc5 expression, leading to decreased expression of pluripotency proteins that facilitates exit from self-renewal. THO is also important for the establishment of pluripotency, as its depletion inhibits somatic cell reprogramming and blastocyst development. Together, our data indicate that THO regulates pluripotency gene mRNA export to control ESC self-renewal and differentiation, and therefore uncover a role for this aspect of post-transcriptional regulation in stem cell fate specification. mouse J1 cells were transfected with non-targeting (NT), Thoc2, and Thoc5 siRNAs.

The hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei are important integrative structures that regulate co-ordinated responses to perturbations in cardiovascular homeostasis. Through descending projections from parvocellular neurons to the brainstem, the PVN acts as an autonomic 'premotor nucleus', regulating reflex changes in sympathetic nerve activity that are involved in blood pressure and blood volume regulation. Endocrine responses are mediated through axonal projections from SON and PVN magnocellular neurons (MCNs) to the capillaries of the posterior pituitary neural lobe. In response to dehydration, a massive release of the antidiuretic peptide hormone vasopressin (VP) into the circulation is accompanied by a dramatic functional remodelling of the HNS. We have used microarrays to comprehensively catalogue the genes expressed in the PVN, the SON and the neurointermediate lobe (NIL) of the pituitary gland. Further, we have identified transcripts that are regulated as a consequence of dehydration, as well as RNAs that are enriched in either the PVN or the SON. We suggest that these differentially expressed genes represent candidate regulators and effectors of HNS activity and remodelling.Keywords: DEHYDRATION, PVN.

Delaying first childbirth is associated with a range of pregnancy complications, but the mechanisms underlying this are unclear. We have hypothesized that prolonged, cyclical, pre-pregnancy exposure to estrogen and progesterone contributes to age-related deterioration of uterine function. We conducted a series of studies in virgin mice of varying age and exposure to hormonal manipulations. We compared the myometrial transcript profile from young (10-12 weeks, n=7) and old (28-30 weeks, n=7) mice. We validated this list using a second experiment of young versus old mice housed in a different animal facility and comparing animals of 10-12 (n=8) and 38-40 (n=7) weeks of age. The pattern of change in these transcripts was very similar. We determined whether removal of the ovaries in early life (8-10 weeks of age) prevented age-related changes. When we compared old animals (38-40 weeks) which had early ovariectomy (n=7) with sham operated controls of the same age (n=7), we found that the transcripts which had been down-regulated by age were upregulated in old animals that had an early ovariectomy. The converse was observed for genes which had been downregulated by age. Hence, early ovariectomy prevented changes in myometrial gene expression associated with aging. We then studied the effect of prolonged, continuous exposure to progesterone between 8 and 36 weeks of age. When we compared old animals (38-40 weeks) that received progesterone implants from 8 to 36-38 weeks (n=10) with old animals receiving implants containing only vehicle (n=5), transcripts which had been down-regulated by age were upregulated by prolonged exposure to progesterone.

In the present study, we aimed to characterize the mRNA and large intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) expression differences between human primary CD4+ T effector subsets and identify potential subset-specific genes. To achieve this goal, mRNA and lincRNA microarray profiling of flow cytometry-sorted human primary Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg cells was performed.

Congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is one of the leading prenatal causes of mental retardation and congenital deformities world-wide. Access to cultured human neuronal lineages, necessary to understand the species specific pathogenic effects of HCMV has been limited by difficulties in sustaining primary cultures. Neuronal cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells now provide a novel opportunity to investigate HCMV pathogenesis. We derived iPS cells from human adult fibroblasts and induced neural lineages to investigate their permissiveness to infection with HCMV strain Ad169. Analysis of iPS cells and nearly pure populations of iPS-derived neural stem cells (NSCs), neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs) and neurons suggests that (i) iPS cells are not permissive to HCMV infection; (ii) Neural stem cells have impaired differentiation when infected by HCMV; (iii) NPCs are fully permissive for HCMV infection; the supernatant from infected neural stem cells and NPCs (but not mock infected cells) induced cytopathic effects in human fibroblasts; (iv) most iPS-derived neurons are not permissive to HCMV infection; and (v) infected neurons have impaired calcium influx in response to glutamate. Our approach offers powerful cellular models to investigate the effect of neurotropic viral agents on human neurodevelopment. Adherent monolayer culture of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) were either infected with HCMV Ad169 in triplicate, with each individual sample harvested separately to provide biological replicates for expression analysis.

    "text": "Sustained L-type Calcium Channel Blockade Alters Gene Regulation in the Adult Mouse Ventricle. Objective: L-type calcium channels (LTCC) homeostatically regulate calcium on a beat by beat basis, but also provide Ca that over long time scales may contribute to transcriptional regulation. We previously showed that sustained LTCC blockade (CCB) elicits LTCC remodeling in ventricular cardiac myocytes (CM). Here we hypothesize that sustained CCB has broad effects on the expression of genes involved in calcium handling. Methods and Results: Therefore, we subjected adult mice to sustained CCB for 24 hours and performed gene expression profiling. In comparison to vehicle-only control animals, 231 genes were up-regulated, and 111 genes were down-regulated by sustained LTCC blockade (p <0.01). Gene ontology analysis suggested that the CaMKIIdelta signaling pathway was up-regulated in these cells. Unexpectedly, phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) at threonine17 (Thr17), an index of CaMKIIdelta activity, was not changed by sustained CCB; however, the degree of phosphorylation of the neighboring PLN-Ser16 substrate site for PKA was significantly reduced by sustained CCB compared to control. Gene expression profiling suggested no change in PKA, but it showed that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) mRNA increased, and immunoblots demonstrated that PP2Ac-alpha protein was significantly increased by sustained CCB. Consistent with elevated PP2Ac-alpha protein expression LTCC exhibited decreased phosphorylation of the C-terminal Ser1928 PKA substrate site. Conclusions: We conclude that sustained CCB elicits a spectrum of transcriptional events, including compensatory up-regulation of LTCC and PP2Ac-alpha. Although this study is restricted to mouse, these results suggest the new hypothesis that clinically-relevant sustained LTCC blockade in humans results in changes in gene regulation in the heart. Keywords: L-type calcium channel, calcium channel blockade, verapamil. Female and male ICR mice (12-14 weeks age) weighing between 25 and 30 grams were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine mixture ( i.p.) allowing the subcutaneous implantation of miniosmotic pumps (Alzet, model 2001). The pumps were filled with either verapamil or vehicle (0.02% ascorbic acid). Control animals carried mini-pumps with vehicle and control animals were investigated in parallel with each set of experimental animals. Mini pumps delivered verapamil at 3.6 mg/kg/day for 24 (RNA)-48 (protein) hours. After treatment animals were anesthetized and weighed. Hearts were excised, rinsed, blotted dry, weighed, and then frozen on dry ice and the stored at -80oC until studied.

Putative LMX1B target genes have been identified through mouse gene targeting studies; however, in the absence of in vivo molecular characterization of their regulation, their identity as direct LMX1B targets remains hypothetical. We describe here the first molecular characterization of LMX1B target gene regulation. A tetracycline-inducible expression system and microarray analysis showed that a subset of NF-kappa B target genes, including IL-6 and IL-8 are upregulated in LMX1B-expressing HeLa cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that LMX1B binds to the proximal promoter region of IL-6 and IL-8 in vivo, in the vicinity of the characterized kappa B site, and that LMX1B recruitment correlates with an increased NF-kappa B DNA association. Inhibition of NF-kappa B activity by short interfering RNA-mediated knock-down of p65 impairs LMX1B-dependent induction of NF-kappa B target genes, while activation of NF-kappa B activity by TNF-alpha results in a synergistic induction of these genes by LMX1B. IL-6 promoter-driven reporter assays showed that the kappa B site and an adjacent putative LMX1B binding motif are both involved in LMX1B-mediated transcription. Expression of a number of NF-kappa B target genes is affected in the kidney of Lmx1b-/- knock-out mice, thus supporting the biological relevance of the data obtained in the human cell line. Together, these data demonstrate for the first time that LMX1B directly regulates transcription of a subset of NF-kappa B target genes in cooperation with nuclear p50/p65 NF-kappa B. Human subset (GSM303547-GSM303550): Two biological replicates of non-expressing HtTA-LMX1B cells (grown in doxycycline-containing medium) and of LMX1B-expressing HtTA-LMX1B cells (grown for 4 days in doxycycline-free medium) were processed for gene expression array analyses using an Affymetrix platform.Mouse subset (GSM304379-GSM304384): Three kidney samples from newborn wild-type mice and from newborn Lmx1b-/- knock-out mice were processed for gene expression array analyses using an Agilent platform.",

Chemotherapy can potentially impair fertility in premenopausal cancer patients. Female fertility preservation has been mainly focused on the ovarian aspects and benefited greatly from assisted reproductive technologies, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). The rate-limiting step for the success of IVF is embryo implantation in the uterus. Doxorubicin (DOX) is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent with ovarian toxicity. It remains unknown if the uterus is a direct target of DOX. To circumvent the indirect uterine effect from ovarian toxicity of DOX and to investigate potential long-term impact of DOX on the uterus, young adult ovariectomized CD-1 mice were given an intraperitoneal injection once with PBS or DOX (10 mg/kg, a human relevant chemotherapeutic dose), and 30 days later, each set of mice was randomly assigned into three groups and subcutaneously injected with oil, 17b-estradiol (E2, for 6 hours), and progesterone (P4, for 54 hours), respectively. Uterine transcriptomic profiles were determined using RNA-seq. Principal component analysis of the uterine transcriptomes revealed four clusters from the six treatment groups: PBS-oil & DOX-oil, PBS-P4 & DOX-P4, PBS-E2, and DOX-E2, indicating that DOX treatment did not affect the overall uterine transcriptomic profiles in the oil and P4-treated mice but altered uterine responses to E2 treatment.

Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease linked to elevated blood cholesterol levels. Since cholesterol retention and cholesterol crystals in arterial walls are key pathogenetic factors for atherogenesis, we assessed the therapeutic potential of increasing cholesterol solubility in vivo. Here we show that treatment of murine atherosclerosis with the cyclic oligosaccharide 2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin (CD), a compound that solubilizes lipophilic substances, reduced atherosclerotic plaque size, cholesterol crystal (CC) load and promoted plaque regression even under continuing Western diet. CD solubilized CC and promoted cholesterylester and oxysterol production in macrophages leading to liver X receptor-mediated transcriptional reprogramming with increased cholesterol efflux and decreased inflammation. CD treatment may thus be used to increase cholesterol solubility and clearance to prevent or treat atherosclerosis.

Background: Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are considered responsible for cancer relapse and drug-resistance. Understanding the identity of BCSCs may open new avenues in breast cancer therapy. Although several discoveries have been made on BCSCs characterization, the factors critical to BCSCs is largely unclear. This study was aimed to determine whether genomic mutation contributes to the acquisition of cancer stem-like phenotype, and to investigate the genetic and transcriptional features of BCSCs.Methods: We detected the potential mutation hotspot regions by using whole genome sequencing on parental cancer cells and derived serial-generation spheroids in increasing order of BCSC frequency, and then performed target deep DNA sequencing in the level of bulk-cell and single-cell. To identify the transcriptional program associated with BCSCs, bulk-cell and single-cell RNA sequencing were performed.Results: By analyzing whole genome sequencing of bulk cells, potential BCSCs associated mutation hotspot regions were detected. Validation by target deep sequencing, in both bulk-cell and single-cell levels, revealed no genetic changes specifically associated with BCSC phenotype. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing showed that cancer cells display profound transcriptional variability at the single-cell level that predicts BCSC features. Notably, this transcriptomic variability is enriched in transcription of a number of genes, revealed as BCSC markers. Individuals with breast cancer in a high-risk recurrence group exhibited higher expression of these transcriptomic variabilities, highlighting their clinical significance.Conclusions: Transcriptional variability, not genetic mutations, distinguish BCSCs from non-BCSCs. The identified BCSCs markers can become novel targets for BCSCs.

This analysis identified 33,542 epididymis-selective DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS), which were not evident in five cell types of different lineages. Identification of genes with epididymis-selective DHS at their promoters revealed gene pathways that are active in immature epididymis epithelial cells. These include processes correlating with epithelial function and also others with specific roles in the epididymis including retinol metabolism and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism. Peaks of epididymis-selective chromatin were seen in the androgen receptor gene and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which has a critical role in regulating ion transport across the epididymis epithelium. In silico prediction of transcription factor binding sites that were over-represented in epididymis-selective DHS identified epithelial transcription factors including ELF5 and ELF3, the androgen receptor, Pax2 and Sox9, as components of epididymis transcriptional networks. Active genes, which are targets of each transcription factor, reveal important biological processes in the epididymis epithelium. HEE cells were cultured as described previously (Harris and Coleman 1989). RNA was isolated by Trizol extraction from three primary cultures of HEE cells. Total RNA was purified by Millipore Microcon YM-100 filter centrifugation and shipped to MoGene, MO, for gene expression analysis on Nimblegen 4 x 72K HG18 60mer arrays.This submission represents transcriptome component of study.",

High activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is characteristic for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here we investigated how 4EGI-1, a small inhibitor of cap-dependent translation, induces apoptosis in T-ALL clones displaying hyperactive PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling. 4EGI-1 treatment reduced the ribosomal occupancy of transcripts that define the molecular difference between T-ALL blasts and normal thymocytes. These transcripts encoded proteins for the translational machinery, for mitochondrial metabolism as well as oncoproteins such as Cyclin D1, Bcl-2 and c-myc. Therefore, targeting translation initiation proves valuable in situations where mTOR is activated by multiple events. For each biological replicate 5 x 107 #483 T-ALL cells were treated with 100 mM 4EGI-1 or DMSO. After 2 h incubation at 37degC cells were washed in ice-cold PBS containing cycloheximide (0.1 mg/ml), pelleted and resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 % nonidet-P40, 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, 10000 IU/ml dalteparin sodium) and incubated for 5 min on ice.

Epithelial membrane protein-2 (EMP2) is a tetraspan protein predicted to regulateplacental development. Highly expressed in secretory endometrium and trophectoderm cells, previous studies suggest that it may regulate implantation by orchestrating the surface expression of integrins and other membrane proteins. In order to confirm the role of EMP2 in pregnancy, mice lacking EMP2 (Emp2-/- ) were generated. These animals are fertile but have reduced litter sizes. Moreover, their placentas exhibit dysregulation in pathways related to neoangiogenesis, coagulation, and oxidative stress, and have increased fibrin deposition and altered vasculature. Given that these findings often occur due to placental insufficiency resulting in an oxygen-poor environment, expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1a) was examined. Emp2-/- animals have reduced HIF-1a expression within cells of trophoblast origin. However, they appear to have a compensatory increase in uterine NK (uNK) cells, demonstrating a unique interplay between uNK cells and trophoblasts modulated through EMP2. To determine if these results translated to human pregnancy, placentas from normal, term deliveries or those complicated by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) were stained for EMP2. EMP2 was significantly reduced in both villous and extravillous trophoblast populations in IUGR placentas. Experiments in vitro using human trophoblast cells lines indicate that EMP2 modulates angiogenesis by altering HIF-1a expression. Our results reveal a novel role for EMP2 in regulating trophoblast function and vascular development in conditions of altered oxygen availability in mice and humans and suggest it may be a novel biomarker for placental insufficiency. Day 13.5 placental tissue was isolated from Emp2+/+ and Emp2-/- animals and snap-frozen.

In mammals, small RNAs are important players in post-transcriptional gene regulation. While their roles in mRNA destabilization and translational repression are well appreciated, their involvement in endonucleolytic cleavage of target RNAs is poorly understood. Very few microRNAs are known to guide RNA cleavage. Endogenous small interfering RNAs are expected to induce target cleavage, but their target genes remain largely unknown. We report a systematic study of small RNA-mediated endonucleolytic cleavage in mouse through integrative analysis of small RNA and degradome sequencing data without imposing any bias towards known small RNAs. Hundreds of small cleavage-inducing RNAs and their cognate target genes were identified, significantly expanding the repertoire of known small RNA-guided cleavage events. Strikingly, both small RNAs and their target sites demonstrated significant overlap with retrotransposons, providing evidence for the long-standing speculation that retrotransposable elements in mRNAs are leveraged as signals for gene targeting. Furthermore, our analysis showed that the RNA cleavage pathway is also present in human cells but affecting a different repertoire of retrotransposons. These results show that small RNA-guided cleavage is more widespread than previously appreciated. Their impact on retrotransposons in non-coding regions shed light on important aspects of mammalian gene regulation. rRNA depleted RNA sequencing was done for four stages of testis development.",

Chronic viral infections are characterized by a state of CD8 T cell dysfunction termed exhaustion. A better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate CD8 T cell responses during chronic infection is required to improve immunotherapies that restore function in exhausted CD8 T cells. Here we identify a novel population of virus-specific CD8 T cells with a T follicular helper (Tfh)-like signature in mice chronically infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). These Tfh-like CD8 T cells expressed the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitory receptor but at the same time also expressed co-stimulatory molecules and had a gene signature that was related to CD8 T cell memory precursor cells and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). These Tfh-like CD8 T cells acted as stem cells during chronic infection undergoing self-renewal and also differentiating into the terminally exhausted CD8 T cells that were present in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. The Tfh-like CD8 T cells were found only in lymphoid tissues and resided predominantly in the T cell zones along with naive CD8 T cells. Interestingly, the proliferative burst after PD-1 blockade came almost exclusively from this Tfh-like CD8 T cell subset. Importantly, the transcription factor TCF1 played a cell intrinsic and essential role in the generation of Tfh-like CD8 T cells. Taken together, our study identifies Tfh-like CD8 T cells as the critical subset for maintaining the pool of virus-specific CD8 T cells during chronic infection and as the cells that proliferate after PD-1 blockade. These findings provide a better understanding of T cell exhaustion and have implications towards optimizing PD-1 directed immunotherapy. 8 samples isolated from CD8 T-cells in LCMV clone 13 GK1.5 infected mice (2 naive, 3 CXCR5+Tim3-, 3 CXCR5-Tim3+) cells were analyzed.",

Loss- and gain-of-function analyses of p62 effectors revealed FERMT2 as an indicator of poor patient prognosis. Analyses in tumor cells, clinical biopsies and genetically-engineered mice (to compare p62 vs. ATG5) demonstrated that known p62 roles in autophagy and stress responses were not essential in melanomas. Instead, a genome-wide transcriptomic/proteomic/interactomic approach demonstrated that p62 controls FERMT2 and yet additional pro-metastatic genes by modulating transcript stability.

Attempts to use atRA for breast cancer treatment without a stratification strategy have resulted in limited overall effectiveness. To identify biomarkers for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with atRA, we characterized the effects of atRA on the tumor growth of 13 TNBC cell lines. This resulted in a range of tumor growth effects that was not predictable based on the levels of retinoid signaling molecules and transcriptional responses that were mostly independent of retinoic acid response elements. Given the importance of DNA methylation in regulating gene expression, we hypothesized that differential DNA methylation could predict the response of TNBCs to atRA. We identified over 1400 CpG sites that were differentially methylated between atRA resistant and sensitive cell lines. These CpG sites predicted the response of four TNBC patient-derived xenografts to atRA treatment and we utilized these xenografts to refine the profile to 6 CpGs. We identify as many as 17% of TNBC patients who could benefit from atRA treatment. These data illustrate that differential DNA methylation of specific sites may predict the response of patient tumors to atRA treatment.This study characterizes the gene expression of 2 triple-negative patient-derived breast cancer xenografts.

Knowing the gene expression profiles of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters throughout gestation is important for understanding the mechanisms of pregnancy-induced changes in drug pharmacokinetics. In this study, we compared gene expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters in the maternal liver, kidney, small intestine, and placenta of pregnant mice throughout gestation by microarray analysis. Specifically, we investigated cytochrome P450 (Cyp), UDP-glucuronosyltranserase (Ugt), and sulfotransferase (Sult), as well as ATP-binding cassette (Abc) and solute carrier (Slc) transporters. We found that relatively few Ugt and Sult genes were impacted by pregnancy in maternal tissues and placenta. Cyp1a2, most Cyp2 isoforms, Cyp3a11, and Cyp3a13 in the liver were down-regulated, with the greatest changes occurring on gestation days (gd) 15 and 19 compared to non-pregnant controls (gd 0). However, Cyp2d40, Cyp3a16, Cyp3a41a, Cyp3a41b, and Cyp3a44 in the liver were induced throughout pregnancy. Cyp expression in mid-gestation placenta (gd 10 and 15) was generally greater than that in term placenta (gd 19). There were also notable changes in Abc and Slc transporters. Abcc3 in the liver was down-regulated by 60%, and Abcb1a, Abcc4, and Slco4c1 in the kidney were down-regulated by 30-60% on gd 15 and 19 versus gd 0. Abcc5 in the placenta was induced 3-fold on gd 10 versus gd 15 and 19, whereas Slc22a3 expression in the placenta on gd 10 was 90% lower than that on gd 15 and 19. Overall, this study demonstrates important gestational age-dependent expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporter genes, which may have mechanistic relevance to human pregnancy.

    "text": "Biological events associated with 99mTcO4--mediated thyroid stunning effect. Rationale: Auger electrons bear a low energy (0-10 keV) which is deposited in a very small volume (a few nm3) around the site of emission. From a radio-toxicological point of view, the effects of Auger electrons on normal tissues are largely unknown, understudied and generally assumed negligible. In this context, the discovery that the Auger electron emitter 99mTc can induce stunning on primary thyrocytes in vitro, at low doses, is intriguing. Extrapolated in vivo, this observation suggests that, a radioisotope as commonly used in nuclear medicine as 99mTc may significantly influence thyroid biology. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the absorbed dose of 99mTc pertechnetate (99mTcO4-) required to induce thyroid stunning in vivo and to analyse the biological events associated/concomitant with this effect. Methods: SPECT/CT imaging of thyroid uptake of 99mTcO4- was used to demonstrate stunning effect in mice and quantitative analysis of the images was used for dosimetric calculations. The biological effects associated with this phenomenon were evaluated by Western blotting, quantitative RT-PCR, histology, immuno-histochmistry and global gene expression pattern analysis. Results: Auger electrons-mediated thyroid stunning can be observed in vivo, in mouse thyroid. The threshold of the absorbed dose to the thyroid required to obtain a significant stunning effect is in the range of 20 Gy. This effect is associated with a reduction in the levels of functional Na/I symporter (NIS) protein without any significant cell death. It is reversible within days. At the cellular level, a decrease in NIS mRNA, the activation of the p53 pathway and the generation of double-strand DNA breaks can be observed. Conclusion: Auger electrons emitted by 99mTc can induce thyroid stunning in vivo, in mice but the thyroid needs to be exposed to a dose of at least 20 Gy, a dose unlikely to be encountered in the clinical practice. Nevertheless, this report represents, to our knowledge, the first example of a significant action of Auger electrons on a normal tissue, in vivo and provides a unique experimental set-up to understand the fine molecular mechanisms involved in the biological effects of Auger electrons.

By applying a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p-value, where significance was set to p <= 0.05, statistically significant differential expression was determined. Furthermore, pathway analysis was performed on transcript lists from both cell lines using GeneCoDis to identify the KEGG and Panther pathways that are significantly different between MOELOW and MOEHIGH cell lines. We find that the splicesome, RNA transport, the cell cycle, and DNA replication were the most highly upregulated pathway whereas the repressed pathways included processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, focal adhesion, and the lysosome. RNA sequencing revealed that p53 in MOELOW and MOEHIGH cells was not mutated; however, MOEHIGH cells had a significant upregulation of a splice variant of p53. The splice variant behaved like wild-type on few targets and missense on some transcriptional targets by qRT-PCR. This study provides a framework for the application of comprehensive chromatin profiling towards characterization of diverse mammalian cell populations. This model provides a framework to uncover a step-wise progression of tumor formation from an oviductal origin to be compared to human disease.

    "text": "Her2/Neu breast cancer mouse model whole tissue transcriptome. Purpose: We generated extensive transcriptional and proteomic profiles from a Her2-driven mouse model of breast cancer that closely recapitulates human breast cancer. This report makes these data publicly available in raw and processed forms, as a resource to the community. Importantly, we previously made biospecimens from this same mouse model freely available through a sample repository, so researchers can obtain samples to test biological hypotheses without the need of breeding animals and collecting biospecimens.Experimental design: Twelve datasets are available, encompassing 841 LC-MS/MS experiments (plasma and tissues) and 255 microarray analyses of multiple tissues (thymus, spleen, liver, blood cells, and breast). Cases and controls were rigorously paired to avoid bias.Results: In total, 18,880 unique peptides were identified (PeptideProphet peptide error rate <=1%), with 3884 and 1659 non-redundant protein groups identified in plasma and tissue datasets, respectively. Sixty-one of these protein groups overlapped between cancer plasma and cancer tissue. Conclusions and clinical relevance: These data are of use for advancing our understanding of cancer biology, for software and quality control tool development, investigations of analytical variation in MS/MS data, and selection of proteotypic peptides for MRM-MS. The availability of these datasets will contribute positively to clinical proteomics. Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 microarrays were used to profile whole tissues from 5 different tissue types of 25 tumor-bearing and 25 control mice of the Her2/Neu breast cancer mouse model. The 5 tissues tested were from breast, liver, spleen, blood cell, and thymus. The tumor-bearing mice were bitransgenic for MMTV-rtTA/TetO-NeuNT, and the control mice were transgenic for TetO-NeuNT only. The control mice were age- and cage-matched to the tumor-bearing mice. All samples were lysed and total RNA isolated and amplified prior to hybridization.",

    "text": "Statistical identification of gene association by CID in application of constructing ER regulatory network. A variety of high-throughput techniques are now available for constructing comprehensive gene regulatory networks in systems biology. In this study, we report a new statistical approach for facilitating in silico inference of regulatory network structure. The new measure of association, coefficient of intrinsic dependence (CID), is model-free and can be applied to both continuous and categorical distributions. When given two variables X and Y, CID answers whether Y is dependent on X by examining the conditional distribution of Y given X. In this paper, we apply CID to analyze the regulatory relationships between transcription factors (TFs) (X) and their downstream genes (Y) based on clinical data. More specifically, we use estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) as the variable X, and the analyses are based on 48 clinical breast cancer gene expression arrays (48A). RESULTS: The analytical utility of CID was evaluated in comparison with four commonly used statistical methods, Galton-Pearson's correlation coefficient (GPCC), Student's t-test (STT), coefficient of determination (CoD), and mutual information (MI). When being compared to GPCC, CoD, and MI, CID reveals its preferential ability to discover the regulatory association where distribution of the mRNA expression levels on X and Y does not fit linear models. On the other hand, when CID is used to measure the association of a continuous variable (Y) against a discrete variable (X), it shows similar performance as compared to STT, and appears to outperform CoD and MI. In addition, this study established a two-layer transcriptional regulatory network to exemplify the usage of CID, in combination with GPCC, in deciphering gene networks based on gene expression profiles from patient arrays. CONCLUSION: CID is shown to provide useful information for identifying associations between genes and transcription factors of interest in patient arrays. When coupled with the relationships detected by GPCC, the association predicted by CID are applicable to the construction of transcriptional regulatory networks. This study shows how information from different data sources and learning algorithms can be integrated to investigate whether relevant regulatory mechanisms identified in cell models can also be partially re-identified in clinical samples of breast cancers. AVAILABILITY: the implementation of CID in R codes can be freely downloaded from (http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~lyliu/BC/). Total 48 clinical arrays (48A) used in this study can be found in GSE9309. We designed the experiments using a given breast cancer population with clear status of estrogen receptor alpha (ER), which were confirmed by immunochemical staining (If 310% immunopositive stain is found at tumor section, we designate it as ER(+). Otherwise, it is ER(-). ) in this study. 48A consist of 36A with positive in ER status and of 12A with negative in ER status.",

The cells of the airway epithelium play critical roles in host defense to inhaled irritants, and in asthma pathogenesis. These cells are constantly exposed to conidiospores of the ubiquitous mould Aspergillus fumigatus, which are small enough to reach the alveoli. This exposure is asymptomatic in most individuals but can be associated with a spectrum of diseases ranging from asthma and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis to aspergilloma and invasive aspergillosis. Airway epithelial cells have been shown to internalize A. fumigatus conidiospores in vitro, but the implications of this process for pathogenesis remain unclear. We have developed a cell culture model for this interaction using the 16HBE cell line and a transgenic A. fumigatus strain expressing green fluorescent protein. Comparing the transcriptional profiles of control cells and cells exposed to A. fumigatus conidiospores using Agilent Whole Human Genome microarrays revealed significant changes in gene expression in response to the presence of conidiospores. The identification of biologically relevant responses validates this methodology, and motivates further work to characterize the interactions between A. fumigatus conidiospores and primary airway epithelial cells of normal and asthmatic origins. Gene expression levels were investigated in 16HBE cells incubated in the presence or absence of A. fumigatus conidiospores for 6 hours.

Malignant gliomas constitute one of the most significant areas of unmet medical need, due to the invariable failure of surgical eradication and their marked molecular heterogeneity. Accumulating evidence has revealed a critical contribution by the Polycomb axis of epigenetic repression. However, a coherent understanding of the regulatory networks affected by Polycomb during gliomagenesis is still lacking. Here we integrate transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses to define Polycomb-dependent networks that promote gliomagenesis, validating them both in two independent mouse models and in a large cohort of human samples. We found that Polycomb dysregulation in gliomagenesis affects transcriptional networks associated to invasiveness and de-differentiation. The dissection of these networks uncovers Zfp423 as a crtitical Polycomb-dependent transcription factor whose silencing negatively impacts survival. The anti-gliomagenic activity of Zfp423 requires interaction with the SMAD proteins within the BMP signaling pathway, pointing to a novel synergic circuit through which Polycomb inhibits BMP signaling.

The net transcriptome of a cancer cell is defined by relative levels of transcription factors, activators, suppressors and co-factors. These in turn are controlled by epigenetic, genetic and metabolic restraints. Here we used RNA-Seq, ChIP-qPCR, and ChIP-Seq to determine the impact of MYCN protein levels on p53 and MYCN mediated transcription in neuroblastoma, a p53 wild-type neural crest derived pediatric malignancy. Of note, about 25% of neuroblastoma is MYCN amplified and expresses 10-100 fold higher levels of MYCN protein than non-amplified tumors. We hypothesized that p53 functions would be globally altered by extreme MYCN levels and this could help to explain aggressive biology and poor long term survival which distinguishes MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. In fact, we found that in the context of high MYCN levels, activation of p53 results in marked changes in transcription of specific p53 and MYCN target loci regulating apoptosis, DNA repair and cell cycle progression. Co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous and GST-fused proteins, as well as ChIP-qPCR confirms formation of p53/MYCN complexes and enrichment of both transcription factors at active loci. This p53/MYC interaction is independent of MYC/MAX complexes. Together, these data demonstrate MYCN to be a direct co-factor modulating p53 transcriptional output in MYCN amplified cancer. To explore the interaction of the MYCN and p53 transcriptional programs, we utilized a MYCN-inducible system to evaluate p53 transcriptional responses by RNA-Seq in the presence of high and low MYCN levels.

Cultured cancer cells exhibit substantial phenotypic heterogeneity when measured in a variety of ways such as sensitivity to drugs or the capacity to grow under various conditions. Among these, the ability to exhibit anchorage-independent cell growth (colony forming capacity in semisolid media), has been considered to be fundamental in cancer biology, because it has been connected with tumor cell aggressiveness in vivo such as tumorigenic and metastatic potentials, and also utilized as a marker for in vitro transformation. Although multiple genetic factors for anchorage-independence have been identified, the molecular basis for this capacity is still largely unknown. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying anchorage independent cell growth, we have used genome-wide DNA microarray studies to develop an expression signature associated with this phenotype. Using this signature, we identify a program of activated mitochondrial biogenesis associated with the phenotype of anchorage-independent growth and importantly, we demonstrate that this phenotype predicts potential for metastasis in primary breast and lung tumors.Keywords: Breast cancer cell lines with various colony-forming ability. To develop an expression signature reflecting the capacity for anchorage-independent cell growth, we first carried out colony formation assays with 19 breast cancer cell lines in suspension culture dish with methyl-cellulose containing media. Starting with 20,000 plated cells, five cell lines (MDA-MB-361, HCC38, ZR75, Hs578T and BT483) gave rise to less than 20 colonies, while 8 cell lines (MCF7, MDA-MB-231, BT20, SKBR3, MDA-MB-435s, T47D and BT474) showed formation of more than 500 colonies.

It is unknown how the VMH regulates skeletal muscle metabolism and predator threat responses, or potential interactions between these. Because skeletal muscle has a great capacity for increasing energy expenditure and is rapidly activated by PO, understanding how the VMH regulates this process could uncover novel targets for obesity treatments. Due to lack of investigation, we sought to provide a foundation for mechanistic exploration. We report transcriptome-wide alterations of the VMH following PO exposure. Our results uncovered novel functional relationships among genes that can now be probed to better understand the dual processing role of the VMH in skeletal muscle metabolism and predator-threat responses. We compared two conditions run in triplicate. Specifically, we compared the RNA-seq results of 3 Sprague Dawley rats exposed to predator odor to 3 Sprague Dawley rats exposed to control odor.",

Background:Physical forces, such as mechanical stress, are essential for tissue homeostasis and influence geneexpression of cells. In particular, the fibroblast has demonstrated sensitivity to extracellular matrices with assumedadaptation upon various mechanical loads. The purpose of this study was to compare the vocal fold fibroblastgenotype, known for its unique mechanically stressful tissue environment, with cellular counterparts at various otheranatomic locales to identify differences in functional gene expression profiles.Results:By using RNA-seq technology, we identified differentially expressed gene programs (DEseq2) among sevennormal human fibroblast primary cell lines from healthy cadavers, which included: vocal fold, trachea, lung, abdomen,scalp, upper gingiva, and soft palate. Unsupervised gene expression analysis yielded 6216 genes differentially expressedacross all anatomic sites. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed grouping based on anatomic site origin rather thandonor, suggesting global fibroblast phenotype heterogeneity. Sex and age-related effects were negligible. Functionalenrichment analyses based on separate post-hoc 2-group comparisons revealed several functional themes within thevocal fold fibroblast related to transcription factors for signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells andextracellular matrix components such as cell signaling, migration, proliferation, and differentiation potential.Conclusions:Human fibroblasts display a phenomenon of global topographic differentiation, which is maintained inisolation via in vitro assays. Epigenetic mechanical influences on vocal fold tissue may play a role in uniquely modellingand maintaining the local environmental cellular niche during homeostasis with vocal fold fibroblasts distinctlyspecialized related to their anatomic positional and developmental origins established during embryogenesis.

Purpose: This particular experiment is part of a broader study on the effects of early-life stress on the cerebellar endocannabinoid system. Early-life stress is a major developmental risk factor. Though studies are now considering the endogenous cannabinoid system, which is highly intertwied with the stress-response, as a moderator of these effects, studies have been largely focused on cerebral effects. Cerebellum is vulnerable to stress during early development and is dense with cannabinoid receptors, making it an important target for stress effects. Moreover, relatively little is known about sex-specific effects in cerebellum. Methods: Limited bedding, a naturalistic rodent model of early-life stress, was performed at postnatal days 2-9. Following, rats were reared normally and adult (postnatal day 70) cerebellar interpositus nucleus mRNA was assessed. Results: Transcriptomics for cerebellar interpositus nucleus revealed substantial sex effects, with minimal effects of stress. Specifically, expression of 25% of the genes evaluated significantly differed by sex alone. Interestingly, in the non-stressed groups, there were significant sex differences in Cnr1, cannabinoid receptor 1. Conclusion: We show robust sex-specific transcriptomics effects in cerebellar interpositus, perhaps suggesting a role for this system in sexual differentiation of the brain. Other regions of cerebellum should be evaluated. Cerebellar interpositus nucleus mRNA profiles were obtain for 70 day old Long-Evans rats with or without early-life limited bedding stress. 27 total samples were analyzed including 8 replicates of males having undergone limited bedding stress, 7 replicates of females having undergone limited bedding stress, 7 replicates of control males reared normally, and 6 replicates of control females reared normally.",

    "text": "GBM invasion transcriptiome. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most advanced form of a large subset of brain tumors collectively known as glioma, is the most aggressive and invasive type of brain tumor. Patients usually experience a median survival range of 9 to 12 months. GBMs are extremely difficult to manage because of the tumor cells' tendency to migrate and pervade into adjacent tissues. Surgical resection of GBMs generally only slows disease progression because any remaining tumor cells proceed to migrate through brain tissues and reform a new tumor mass. It is hypothesized that the invasive phenotype of these tumor cells may be attributable to unique gene expression. Stationary core and invasive rim tumor cells were collected separately by laser capture microdissection (LCM) from 19 biopsy samples. Identification of differentially expressed genes in the tumor core and invasive rim can give valuable insight to the genes and pathways potentially involved with the invasive phenotype. This information can then be used to generate possible biomarkers, diagnostic markers, or drug targets. Human glioblastoma tumor samples were obtained from patients who underwent primary therapeutic brain tumor resection. All specimens were collected and submitted to the study under institutional review board approved protocols. None of the patients had been subjected to chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to resection, in order to avoid genetic signatures that are due to exposure to alkylating agents and/or ionizing radiation. All specimens were verified as GBMs by a neuropathologist.Tumors are embedded in OCT, then sectioned in a cryostat at -20C, to a thickness of 8-10 um and placed onto HistoGene slides. Sections to be microdissected are removed from the -80C fixed and stained with an abbreviated Hematoxylin and Eosin protocol. Two thousand tumor core and invasive cells are dissected onto separate caps using the PixCell II instrument using CapSure(tm) Macro LCM Caps. The CapSure(tm) Macro LCM Caps LCM 0211 should be used with the AutoPix instrument. Cells in the tumor core are identified by nuclear atypia and size and captured using the larger spot sizes. Tumor cells immediately adjacent to necrotic areas, cortical areas, cells with small regular nuclei, endothelial and blood cells should be avoided. Individual white matter invading GBM cells can be identified by means of their nuclear atypia and heteropyknotic staining, which is consistent with that of the cells within the tumor core. They should be microdissected using the 7.5 um laser spot size and the initial power settings recommended by the PixCell II manual. After microdissection all harvested material should immediately be lysed on the cap by applying the lysis buffer (XB) from the PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit according to the PicoPure protocol and stored -80C. Cell populations harvested on different caps can be pooled at the time of RNA isolation. RNA integrity is varified by identification of distinct 28S and 18S ribosomal bands with an Agilent Bioanalyzer using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kit.Total RNA was isolated from 2000 LCM cells (to ensure at least 500 ng total RNA) using the PicoPure RNA solation Kit, following manufacturers protocol. mRNA is reverse transcribed with the RiboAmp RNA Amplification kit.500 ng total RNA is amplified with the RiboAmp RNA Amplification kit, following manufacturer's instructions. The total yield that can be expected falls between 30 and 60 ug copy RNA. The size of the copy RNA should be verified by gel electrophoresis. Approximately 500ng of copy RNA can be separated on a 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer. A smear of amplified material should be seen between 200 and 3000bp. Six ug amplified RNA are labeled in a RT with SuperScriptIII in the presence of dUTP Cy5 utilizing 6 ug random hexamers as primers. Universal reference RNA is amplified one round in the same manner and labeled with Cy3 dUTP. Labeled cDNA is hybridized overnight onto cDNA microarray. Following hybridization, arrays are washed, scanned and quantitated with the Axon GenePix 4000 microarray reader (Axon Instruments). Gene expression results are analyzed using GeneSpring (Silicon Genetics) software. Intensity dependent normalization is applied, where the ratio is reduced to the residual Lowess fit of the intensity versus ratio curve. The measured intensity of each gene is divided by its reference channel (signal from the universal reference RNA) in each sample. When the reference channel is below 10, the data point is considered uninformative. The ratios (sample over reference) for the tumor core experiments and invasive rim experiments are averaged and compared. Genes that are more than two-fold differentially regulated in the majority of the matched core/invasive rim sets are selected.",

Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a main type of T cell lymphomas and comprises three distinct entities: systemic ALK+, systemic ALK- and cutaneous ALK- ALCL. Little is known about their pathogenesis and their cellular origin, and morphological and immunophenotypical overlap exists between ALK- ALCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). We conducted gene expression profiling of microdissected lymphoma cells of ALK+ and ALK- systemic ALCL, cutaneous ALCL and cHL, and of eight subsets of normal T and NK cells. The analysis supports a derivation of ALCL from activated T cells, but the lymphoma cells acquired a gene expression pattern hampering an assignment to a CD4+, CD8+ or CD30+ T cell origin. Indeed, ALCL display a general down-modulation of T cell characteristic molecules. All ALCL types show significant expression of NFkB target genes and upregulation of genes involved in oncogenesis (e.g. EZH2). Surprisingly few genes are differentially expressed between systemic and cutaneous ALK- ALCL despite their different clinical behaviour, and between ALK- ALCL and cHL despite their different cellular origin.

DNA damage activates a complex signaling network in cells that blocks cell cycle progression, recruits factors involved in DNA repair, and/or triggers programs that control senescence or programmed cell death. Alterations in chromatin structure are known to be important for the initiation and propagation of the DNA damage response, although the molecular details are unclear. We investigated the role of chromatin structure in the DNA damage response by monitoring multiple timedependent checkpoint signaling and response events with a high-content multiplex image-based RNAi screen of chromatin modifying and interacting genes. We discovered that Brd4, a double bromodomain-containing protein, functions as an endogenous inhibitor of DNA damage signaling by binding to acetylated histones at sites of open chromatin and altering chromatin accessibility. Loss of Brd4 or disruption of acetyl-lysine binding results in an increase in both the number and size of radiation-induced !H2AX nuclear foci while overexpression of a Brd4 splice isoform completely suppresses !H2AX formation, despite equivalent double strand break formation. Brd4 knock-down cells displayed altered chromatin structure, prolonged cell cycle checkpoint arrest and enhanced survival after irradiation, while overexpression of Brd4 isoform B results in enhanced radiationinduced lethality. Brd4 is the target of the t(15;19) chromosomal translocation in a rare form of cancer, NUT Midline Carcinoma. Acetyl lysine-bromodomain interactions of the Brd4-NUT fusion protein suppresses !H2AX foci in discrete nuclear compartments, rendering cells more radiosensitive, mimicking overexpression of Brd4 isoform B. NUT Midline Carcinoma is sensitive to radiotherapy, however tumor material from this rare cancer is scarce. We therefore investigated Brd4 expression in another human cancer commonly treated with radiotherapy, glioblastoma multiforme, and found that expression of Brd4 isoform B correlated specifically with treatment response to radiotherapy. These data implicate Brd4 as an endogenous insulator of DNA damage signaling through recognition of epigenetic modifications in chromatin and suggest that expression of the Brd4 in human cancer can modulate the clinical response to DNA-damaging cancer therapy.

In this study, we compared the gene expression profiles of SP and non-SP cells in STS and identified Hedgehog (Hh) and Notch pathways as potential candidates for the targeting of SP cells. Upon verification of the activation of these pathways in SP cells, using primary tumor xenografts in NOD-SCID mice as our experimental model, we used the Hh blocker Triparanol and the Notch blocker DAPT to demonstrate that the suppression of these pathways effectively depleted the abundance of SP cells, reduced tumour growth, and inhibited the tumour-initiating potential of the treated sarcoma cells upon secondary transplantation. The data provide additional evidence that SP cells act as tumour initiating cells and points to Hh and Notch pathways as enticing targets for developing potential cancer therapies.We used microarrays to detail the difference in gene expressions between the side population cells in soft-tissue sarcoma in comparison to the bulk non-side-population cells. To examine whether certain pathways may be differentially regulated in SP cells versus non-SP cells, which represent the bulk of tumour cells, we compared the gene expression profiles of SP and non-SP cells in four primary STS tumours each from different patient.

Genetic variants altering cis-regulation of normal gene expression (cis-eQTLs) have been extensively mapped in human cells and tissues, but the extent to which environmental perturbation influences such traits has not been studied to date. We carried out large-scale induction experiments using primary human bone cells derived from 113 unrelated donors of Swedish origin harvested under 18 different conditions (seven treatments, two vehicles, each assessed at two time points). The treatments with the largest impact on the transcriptome, verified on two independent expression arrays, included BMP-2 (t=2h), dexamethasone (DEX) (t=24h), and PGE2 (t=24h). Using these treatments, we performed expression profiling for 18,144 RefSeq transcripts applying biological replicates of the complete study cohort (ntotal=782) and combined it with genome-wide SNP-genotyping data in order to map treatment-specific cis-eQTLs. We found that 93% of cis-eQTLs at 1% FDR were replicated in at least one additional treatment and in fact, on average only 1.4% of the cis-eQTLs were considered as treatment-specific at high confidence. The relative invariability of cis-regulation following perturbation was reiterated independently by genome-wide allelic expression tests where only a small proportion of variance could be attributed to treatment, though treatment-specific cis-regulatory effects were 2-6-fold more abundant among up-or downregulated genes. We further followed-up and validated the DEX-specific cis-regulation of the MYO6 and TNC loci and found top cis-regulatory variants located 180 and 250kb upstream of the transcription start sites, respectively.

After an acclimatization period of 1 week, the mice were fed a control (CT) or an n-3 PUFA-depleted diet (DEF) for 3 months. At the end of the study period, mice (CT, n=6; DEF, n=7) were anesthetized after a 6h period of fasting. Some mice (CT: n=4 et DEF: n=7) were anesthetized without being starved. A fraction of the main liver lobe was fixed-frozen in isopentane and kept at -80degC for histological analysis. The excess tissue material was immediately clamped in liquid N2 and kept at -80degC. All mice experiments were approved by the local animal ethics committee, and the housing conditions were as specified by the Belgian Law of November 14, 1993 on the protection of laboratory animals (agreement ndeg LA 1230314).",

We find that transcriptome and proteome levels of function are highly conserved between different mice, while the topological organization (the toponome) of protein clusters in synapses of the hippocampus is highly individual, with only few interindividual overlaps (0.15 %). In striking contrast, the overall spatial patterns of individual synaptic states, defined by protein clusters, have boundaries within a strict and non-individual spatial frame of the total synaptic network.

CD30L is expressed primarily on activated T cells and subpopulations of B cells. The significance of CD30/CD30L interactions in immune regulation is not fully understood. Reported activities of CD30/CD30L in immune responses imply roles in regulation of secondary memory and antibody responses. Depending on the experimental system, both positive and negative regulation of immunoglobulin class switching and antibody production have been reported. Additionally, the biological activity of CD30/CD30L in animals has been difficult to assess due to the restricted and tightly regulated expression of this receptor-ligand pair. We generated transgenic mice with constitutive T cell specific overexpression of CD30L as a tool to help unravel the consequences of CD30/CD30L interactions in vivo. CD30L transgenic mice displayed a phenotype and responses to antigen challenge supporting a role for CD30/CD30L in promoting immunoglobulin class switching and antibody production. CD30L transgenic mice had increased numbers of germinal centers, elevated class-switched immunoglobulin isotypes, increased germinal center B cells and plasma cells, upregulation of genes indicative of B-cell activity, and exaggerated antibody responses to immune challenge. Interestingly, despite the heightened B-cell activity in CD30L transgenic mice, CD30L overexpression on T cells did not result in overt autoimmunity. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of CD30L on T cells promotes T cell-dependent B cell responses characterized by secondary antibody responses.Keywords: Transgenic vs. wild-type.

Understanding congenital liver disease requires elucidation of the signaling pathways and transcriptional events in the developing liver. Comprehensive assessment of gene expression between 10.5 and 16.5 dpc in the developing mouse liver and comparison with adult liver and non-hepatic embryonic tissue was validated with real-time PCR and in situ hybridization. The broad nature of the analysis provides insights into patterns of genetic control of hepatogenesis. Pathways implicated in human disease are highly regulated at the transcriptional level. Rather than activating or inhibiting a pathway or biological process by altering the expression of a single signaling molecule, transcriptional changes in large numbers of genes in a pathway or process are regulated in a coordinated manner. For example, both TGF-beta and Notch signaling is inhibited during hepatogenesis not just by decreasing transcription of multiple pathway members, but also with a complementary increase in the transcription of a pathway inhibitor. Similarly, genes related to specific biological processes exhibit strong temporal synchronization in which multiple members of the pathway have similar transcriptional regulation over time. Global coordination of signaling or functional families at the transcriptional level may be a mechanism to produce robustness of the desired outcomes. In addition, this comprehensive analysis provides a database for the further study of transcriptional events during liver development by identifying liver-specific, highly regulated genes. Keywords: time course.

We recently identified TRM within SLO, and this study addresses knowledge gaps in their origin and phenotype. Parabiosis of 'dirty' mice revealed that CD69 expression is insufficient to infer stable residence. Using selective depletion strategies, parabiosis, imaging, tissue grafting, and photoactivatable T cells, we report that restimulation of TRM within the skin or mucosa results in a substantial increase in TRM that patrol all regions of draining lymph nodes.

The oncogenic roles of Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) in various cancers, including thyroid cancer, have been well demonstrated. However, miRNAs associated with the oncogenic roles of SphK1 remains largely unknown. The goal of this study is to detect the global gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression in response to Sphk1 over-expression and identify potential therapeutic targets. To achieve this, SphK1 was stably overexpressed in papillary thyroid cancer cell line TPC1. Then the mRNA and miRNA expression were quantified using digital gene expression (DGE) analysis and small RNA-seq in TPC1-Vector and TPC1-SphK1 cells, respectively. miRNA-mRNA interactions were explored by microT-CDS and the predicted networks were visualized using CytoScape. In this study, we found that over-expression of SphK1 differentially regulates 46 miRNA and 506 mRNAs expression in TPC1 cells. Combining bioinformatics prediction of mRNA targets and DGE data on mRNA expressions allowed to identify mRNA targets of deregulated miRNAs. The direct interaction between miR-144-3p and FN1 mRNA, which mediates the pro-invasive role of SphK1 in thyroid cancer cells, was experimentally validated.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase ERBB2/HER2, such as Trastuzumab, are the standard of care therapy for breast cancers driven by ERBB2 overexpression and activation. However, a substantial proportion of patients exhibits de novo resistance. Here, by comparing matched Trastuzumab-naive and post-treatment patient samples from a neoadjuvant trial, we link resistance with elevation of H3K27me3, a repressive histone modification catalyzed by Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2). In ErbB2+ breast cancer models, PRC2 silences endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) to suppress anti-tumor Type-I interferon (IFN) responses. In patients, elevated H3K27me3 in tumor cells following Trastuzumab treatment correlates with suppression of IFN-driven viral defense gene expression signatures and poor response.

Background: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a malignant clonal disorder of the hematopoietic system caused by the expression of the BCR/ABL fusion oncogene. It is well known that CML cells are genetically unstable. However, the mechanisms by which these cells acquire genetic alterations are poorly understood. Imatinib mesylate (IM) is the standard therapy for newly diagnosed CML patients. IM targets the oncogenic kinase activity of BCR-ABL. Objective: To study the gene expression profile of BM hematopoietic cells in the same patients with CML before and one month after imatinib therapy. Methods: Samples from patients with CML were analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Arrays. Results: A total of 594 differentially expressed genes, most of which (393 genes) were downregulated, as a result of imatinib therapy were observed. Conclusions: The blockade of oncoprotein Bcr-abl by imatinib could cause a decrease in the expression of key DNA repair genes, and cells try to restore the normal gene expression levels required for cell proliferation and chromosomal integrity. Materials and MethodsPatientsNine patients with the diagnosis of Ph-positive CML and nine samples from normal donors were analyzed. In all patients bone marrow samples were obtained by bone marrow aspiration. All patients received a daily dose of 400 mg imatinib mesylate (IM). In all patients bone marrow was sampled before IM administration commenced and 4 weeks after the treatment, by which time all cases were in hematological response. In addition, all patients showed a complete cytogenetic response six months after starting therapy. The study was approved by the local research ethics committee and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.RNA isolation, labeling and microarray hybridizationTotal RNA was isolated from bone marrow in Trizol aliquots, following the manufacturer's instructions, and purified using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). RNA integrity and yield were assessed by determining sample absorbance at 260 and 280 nm and by analysis on the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano LabChip (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, CA).Microarray assays were performed according to the standard protocol described in the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual, rev. 3 (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/index.affx). Messenger RNA was amplified and labeled from 5-ug samples, which produced a sufficient yield of cRNA. These samples were fragmented and combined with array hybridization controls (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in hybridization buffer. 11 ug of cRNA target were then hybridized with the GeneChip HG_U133 Plus 2.0 array (Affymetrix) and scanned with the GeneArray laser scanner (Affymetrix).Genome-wide expression data analysisThe expression value for each probe set was calculated using RMA-Express software, which uses the robust multi-array average (RMA) algorithm, as previously described [28]. For an initial analysis, gene-filtering methods were applied following the detection calls calculated using the MAS 5.0 algorithm (Affymetrix). Probe sets with absent calls and those showing minimal variation across all samples (maximum-minimum log2 variation <2.5) were filtered out.The significant analysis of microarrays (SAM) algorithm was used to identify genes with statistically significant differences in expression between classes. All data were permuted over 100 cycles using the two-class (unpaired) and multi-class response format, with no necessity for equal variances. Significant genes were identified on the basis of the lowest false-discovery ratio (FDR), controlling the q-value for the gene list. The FDR was <2% in all class comparisons.A web-delivered bioinformatics tool set, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA 5.5; http://www.ingenuity.com), was used to identify functional networks. IPA is a knowledge database generated from peer-reviewed scientific publications. It enables the discovery, visualization and exploration of functional biological networks in gene expression data and delineates the most significant functions in those networks.Gene-specific real-time PCRIn order to validate the results of the microarray studies, quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed at the time of diagnosis and four weeks after imatinib therapy. One microgram of total RNA was subjected to cDNA synthesis, as previously described [29]. Quantification was performed using Fast SYBR-Green Master Mix according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The expression of the following genes was analyzed: POLE2, FANCD2, PTEN, FOXO3, and ABCB7. The specific primers were designed with Primer Express 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems) and tested for specificity using NCBI's BLAST software. Gene expression was achieved using relative quantitative real-time RT-PCR and the SYBR(r) Green I. Expression was quantified relative to GAPDH expression by the application of the Pfaffl analysis method.",

Analysis of cancer epigenomes has revealed important insights into key lineage determinants and oncogenic drivers. Chromatin immune-precipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) has allowed the comprehensive mapping of transcription factor cistromes and histone modifications in fresh or frozen cells and tissues. It has not been possible, however, to apply ChIP-seq to the vast majority of clinical tissue samples, owing to the very extensive tissue fixation and cross-linking introduced during routine pathological processing. This severely limits the ability to study the most valuable, clinically annotated tissue resources. Here we describe Fixed-Tissue chromatin immune-precipitation sequencing (FiT-seq), which allows the epigenomic analysis of routine formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples. FiT-seq enables reliable extraction of soluble chromatin from fixed tissues for accurate detection of histone marks and we verify high concordance between FiT-seq from FFPE and ChIP-seq from matched fresh frozen (FF) samples of the same tumors. We demonstrate the value of FiT-seq to investigate differences in chromatin states in normal and malignant colorectal epithelium and to identify robust correlations to methylated DNA, gene expression, and transcription factor activities. Using multiple histone marks we generate chromatin state maps and identify tissue- and tumor-specific cis-regulatory elements in clinical samples from various tumor types, readily distinguishing cancers by tissue of origin.

    "text": "Unwinding the interplay between brain and liver in the pathophysiology of brain trauma. Although clinical evidence indicates that TBI has profound effects on peripheral metabolism, TBI research has primarily focused on the CNS. The liver plays a major role in control of homeostasis and pathogenesis, affecting synthesis of lipids and proteins used across the body and brain. Fructose consumption is common in the Western Society and a major cause of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and obesity. Results showed that fructose consumption in rodents for 3 weeks, under the threshold for establishment of metabolic syndrome, exacerbates the deleterious effects of fluid percussion injury on glucose metabolism, inflammation, and cell energy homeostasis. These effects of TBI and fructose seem to engage the hypothalamic neuroendocrine axis by involving the growth hormone system with resulting effects on a metabolic/inflammatory cascade in the periphery. Fructose fed TBI animals had elevated markers of inflammation (TLR4), lipid peroxidation (4HNE), and reduced markers of cell energy homeostasis (uMitCK) as well as reduced insulin signaling proteins (InR, IRS1) and growth hormone signaling proteins (GHR, IGF-1) in the liver. Fructose also potentiated the action of TBI on hepatic lipid droplet accumulation involving lipid-promoting factors (FAS, LXRa, CD36, ABCA1). Studies in cultured hepatocytes validated the action of growth hormone and fructose on the synthesis of FAS and CD36. TBI affects the transcriptomic profiling in the hypothalamus and several differentially expressed genes that are primarily associated to lipid metabolism providing cues for peripheral alterations in TBI pathology. These results reveal that the effects caused by TBI are not limited to the CNS, and that fructose promotes a stage of metabolic dysfunction that potentiates the effects of TBI on systemic metabolism. RNA samples of hypothalamus from Sham and TBI rats (n=5 per group ) were used for RNA-Seq sequenced in paired-end mode by HiSeq 4000 (Illumina Inc., CA, USA).",

We investigated the role of chemokines in regulating T-cell accumulation in solid tumors. CCL5 and CXCL9 overexpression was associated with CD8+ T-cell infiltration in common solid tumors. T-cell infiltration required tumor cell-derived CCL5 and was amplified by IFN-dependent, myeloid cell-secreted CXCL9. Accordingly, CCL5-CXCL9 co-expression revealed immunoreactive tumors with prolonged survival and response to checkpoint blockade. Loss of CCL5 expression in human tumors was associated with epigenetic silencing through DNA methylation. Reduction of CCL5 expression caused TIL desertification whereas forced CCL5 expression prevented Cxcl9 and TIL loss and attenuated tumor growth in mice through IFN. The cooperation between tumor-derived CCL5 and IFN-inducible CXCR3 ligands secreted by myeloid cells is key for orchestrating T-cell infiltration in immunoreactive and immunoresponsive tumors. RNA isolated from tumor tissues of early (3weeks ) and late (6weeks) ID8 tumors was subjected to trasncriptomic analysis by using theNanostring Gene Expression CodeSet profiling of 561 immunology-related mouse genes (GLP19964).",

This work shows that signaling-lymphocytic-activation-molecule-1 (SLAMF1), a co-stimulatory molecule and a microbial sensor, is expressed by normal CD19+/CD5+ B-lymphocytes. Its expression is lost in a subset of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) characterized by an aggressive form of the disease, with shorter time to first treatment and overall survival. Silencing of SLAMF1 in the CLL-like Mec-1 cell line (constitutively SLAMF1+) modulated pathways connected to cell migration, cytoskeletal organization and intracellular vesicle formation/recirculation. Loss of SLAMF1 was associated to increased expression of CXCR4, CD38 and CD44, positively affecting chemotactic responses to CXCL12. Ligation of SLAMF1 with an agonistic monoclonal antibody promoted the autophagic flux, by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and inducing phosphorylation of p38, JNK1/2 and bcl-2. The direct consequence was the assembly of the autophagy macro-complex that included SLAMF1, the scaffold protein Beclin1 and the enzyme Vps34. Consistently, SLAMF1-silenced cells or SLAMF1low primary CLL cells were resistant to autophagy-activating therapeutic agents, such as fludarabine or the BH3 mimetic ABT-737. These results indicate that loss of SLAMF1 expression modulates genetic pathways regulating chemotaxis and autophagy and potentially affecting drug responses, thus providing a likely explanation for the unfavorable clinical outcome experienced by this patient subset. Microarrays were performed comparing genetic signature of CLL-like Mec-1 cell line (constitutively SLAMF1+), transfected with a non-effective (scrambled) shRNA cassette (TR30013) used as control, and a Mec-1 variant generated silencing SLAMF1 gene using pGFP-V-RS construct for SLAMF1 shRNA (TG309422).

Response to immune checkpoint inhibitors may be improved through combinations with each other and other therapies, raising questions about non-redundancy and resistance. We report results from parallel studies of melanoma patients and mice treated with anti-CTLA4 and radiation (RT). Although combined treatment improved responses, resistance was common. Computational analyses of immune and transcriptomic profiles (provided here) revealed that resistance in mice was due to upregulation of tumor PD-L1 that drives T cell exhaustion. Accordingly, optimal response requires RT, anti-CTLA4, and anti-PD-L1. Anti-CTLA4 inhibits Tregs, RT diversifies and shapes the TCR repertoire, and anti-PD-L1 reinvigorates exhausted T cells. Together, all three therapies promote the expansion of clonotypes with distinct TCR traits. Similar to mice, patients with melanoma showing high PD-L1 did not respond to RT + anti-CTLA4, demonstrated persistent T cell exhaustion, and rapidly progressed. Thus, the combination of RT, anti-CTLA4, and anti-PD-L1 promotes response through distinct mechanisms. Mice with bilateral flank B16-F10 tumors were treated with radiation to one tumor combinated with CTLA4 blockade. From unirradiated tumors that were resistant or relapsed after therapy, cell lines were isolated. After confirming the resistance phenotype by reimplantation, tumors from these resistant cells and control sensitive cells were profiled by microarray.",

We demonstrate that while DDX6 interacts with Ccr4-Not, its effects in the mechanism are not as pronounced. Through its interaction with the Ccr4- Not complex, eIF4A2 represses mRNAs at translation initiation.

To determine global mRNA expression levels in the corneal and conjunctival epithelia and identify transcripts that exhibit preferential tissue expression.METHODS. cDNA samples derived from human conjunctival and corneal epithelia were hybridized in three independent experiments to a commercial oligonucleotide array representing > 22,000 transcripts. The resulting signal intensities and transcript present/absent calls by the primary microarray analyzing software were used in conjunction with a statistical method to identify transcripts that are preferentially or exclusively (transcripts absent in all three replicates in the other tissue) and significantly (expression >1% of the ss-actin level) expressed in one of the two tissues. EASE was used to identify biological systems comparatively over-represented in either epithelium. Immuno-, and cyto-histochemistry was performed to validate or expand on selected the results of interest.RESULTS. Our analysis identified 332 preferential and 93 exclusive significant corneal epithelial transcripts. The corresponding conjunctival epithelium values were 592 and 211. The over-represented biological processes in the cornea were related to cell adhesion and oxi-redox equilibria and cytoprotection activities. In the conjunctiva the biological processes that were most prominent were related to innate immunity and to melanogenesis. Immunohistochemistry for antigen presenting cells and melanocytes were consistent with these gene signatures. The transcript comparison identified a substantial number of genes that have either not previously been identified or not known to be highly expressed in these two epithelia, including, testican-1, ECM1, a forming isoform, CRTAC1 and NQO1 in the cornea and sPLA2-IIA, multiple MCH class II proteins, IGFBP3, and Na-Pi cotransporter type IIb in the conjunctiva. CONCLUSION. Comparative gene expression profiling led to the identification of many biological processes and previously unknown genes potentially important for the function of corneal and conjunctival epithelia. Keywords: Cell type comparison. Whole human conjunctivae and human corneas were obtained from the National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI, Philadelphia, PA) and processed between 48 - 72 hr of death.

    "text": "3' Uridylation Expands miRNA Target Repertoire. Many microRNAs (miRNAs) exist alongside abundant miRNA isoforms (isomiRs), most of which arise from post-maturation sequence modifications, such as 3' uridylation. However, the ways in which these sequence modifications affect miRNA function remain poorly understood. Here, using human miR-27a in cell lines as a model, we have discovered that a nonfunctional target site unable to base pair extensively with the miRNA seed sequence can regain function when an upstream adenosine is able to base-pair with a post-transcriptionally added uridine in the miR-27a tail. This Tail-U-Mediated Repression (TUMR) is abolished in cells lacking the uridylation enzymes TUT4 and TUT7, indicating that uridylation alters miRNA function by modulating target recognition. We identified a set of non-canonical targets in human cells that are specifically regulated by uridylated miR-27a. We provide evidence that TUMR expands the targets of other endogenous miRNAs. Our study reveals a function for uridylated isomiRs in regulating non-canonical miRNA targets. HEK293T cells and TUT4/7 Double Knockout (DKO) cells with or without ectopic expression of miR-27a or specific depletion of miR-148b were subjected to miRNA-Seq and isomiR profile analyses.

Abhd15 expression is correlated with insulin resistance in obese humans, however its physiological function remains unknown. We used the microarray technology to gain insight into ABHD15's physiological function by identifying dysregulated genes in liver from Abhd15-ko mice in comparison to WT mice.We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in liver and identified distinct dysregulated genes in response to refeeding.

The impact of such maternal information beyond embryonic development is largely unclear. Here we report that maternal contribution of histone H3.3 assembly complexes can prevent the expression of late-onset anatomical, physiologic, and behavioral abnormalities of C. elegans. We show that mutants lacking hira-1, an evolutionarily conserved H3.3-deposition factor, have severe pleiotropic defects that manifest predominantly at adulthood. These late-onset defects can be maternally rescued, and maternally derived HIRA-1 protein can be detected in hira-1(-/-) progeny. A screen for mutants that mimic the hira-1 mutant phenotype identified a HIRA complex component (PQN-80/UBN1) and a second H3.3 chaperone (XNP-1/ATRX). pqn-80 and xnp-1 abnormalities are also maternally rescued. Furthermore, mutants lacking histone H3.3 have late-onset defects similar to those of hira-1, pqn-80, and xnp-1 mutants. These data demonstrate that H3.3 assembly complexes provide non-DNA-based heritable information that can markedly influence adult phenotype.

Despite of considerable advance in molecular classification of GBMs, no improvements in therapy have been described. The scenario is further complicated by tumor heterogeneity and the relationship among genetic, transcriptional and functional findings. Classically, gene expression has been evaluated by steady-state mRNA, however, this does not take translational control into consideration, which contributes considerably to the composition of the proteome. In this study, we evaluated the transcriptomic and translatomic signature of a GBM obtained from a single patient focusing in tumor heterogeneity. In a sampling of eight fragments, we investigated the translation rates, mTORC1 and ERK1/2 pathways and identified both total and polysome associated mRNAs. An increased translation rate was observed in fragments with high-grade histological features. High-grade histology was also associated with the expression of genes related to extracellular matrix (ECM) and angiogenesis, in both transcriptomes and translatomes. However, genes associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition and stress response, were observed only in translatomes from high-grade fragments. Overall, our results demonstrate that isolation of translated mRNA can be used to identify biomarkers and reveal previously unrecognized determinants of heterogeneity in GBMs. Six histologically distinct fragments from a secondary glioblastoma, which were classified as high- or low-grade, by an experienced pathologist according to the 2016 World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System.

We hypothesized that healthy individuals exposed to low levels of tobacco smoke must have biologic changes in the small airway epithelium compared to healthy unexposed individuals. Methods: Small airway epithelium was obtained by bronchoscopy from 121 individuals; microarrays assessed genome wide gene expression, and urine nicotine and cotinine were used to categorized subjects as \"nonsmokers,\" \"active smokers,\" and \"low exposure.\" The gene expression data was used to determine the threshold and ID50 of urine nicotine and cotinine at which the small airway epithelium showed abnormal responses. Results: There was no threshold of urine nicotine without an abnormal small airway epithelial response, and only a slightly above detectable threshold abnormal response for cotinine. The nicotine ID50 for nicotine was 25 ng/ml and cotinine 104 ng/ml. Conclusions: The small airway epithelium detects and responds to low levels of tobacco smoke with transcriptome modifications. This provides biologic correlates of epidemiologic studies linking low level tobacco smoke exposure to lung health risk, health, identifies genes in the lung cells most sensitive to tobacco smoke and defines thresholds at the lung epithelium responds to inhaled tobacco smoke.

As differences may facilitate potentially different screening and treatment modalities, we sought to examine the relationship between urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis (rUC) and urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (bUC). Fresh tumor tissue was collected from patients with bUC (n=10) and benign mucosa from the bladder (n=7) was collected from individuals undergoing resection for non-UC conditions for comparison. Gene expression profiles from these samples were determined using high-throughput Affymetrix gene expression microarray chips. Bioinformatic approaches were used to compare gene expression profiles of these samples and those of rUC (n= 14) and normal kidney (n=14) that were mostly used in our previous publication. Using unsupervised analytic approaches, rUC and bUC were indistinguishable. When supervised analytic approach was used, a very small number of potentially differentially expressed genes was identified; these differences were most likely to be limited to a single pathway - the chloride ion binding activity pathway -which was more frequently activated in rUC than in bUC. We found that the gene expression profiles of UCs from the upper and lower tract were extremely similar, suggesting that similar pathogenic mechanisms likely function in the development of these tumors. The differential expression of genes in the identified pathway may represent a potential new avenue for detection of upper tract tumors.

Immune-Responsive Gene 1 (Irg1) is a mitochondrial enzyme that produces itaconate under inflammatory conditions principally in cells of myeloid lineage. Cell culture studies suggest that itaconate regulates inflammation through inhibitory effects on cytokine and reactive oxygen species production. To evaluate the functions of Irg1 in vivo, we challenged wild-type (WT) and Irg1-/- mice with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and monitored disease progression. Irg1-/- but not WT mice succumbed rapidly to Mtb, and mortality was associated with increased infection, inflammation, and pathology. Infection of LysM-Cre Irg1fl/fl, MPR8-Cre Irg1fl/fl, and CD11c-Cre Irg1fl/fl conditional knockout mice along with neutrophil depletion experiments revealed a role for Irg1 in alveolar macrophages and LysM+ myeloid cells in preventing neutrophil-mediated immunopathology and disease. RNA-seq analyses suggest that Irg1 and its production of itaconate temper Mtb-induced inflammatory responses in myeloid cells at the transcriptional level. Thus, Irg1 modulates inflammation to curtail Mtb-induced lung disease. Macrophages were obtained by culturing bone marrow cells in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 U penicillin per mL, 100 mg streptomycin per mL, and 22 ng M-CSF (Peprotech) per ml for 6 days at 37degC, 5% CO2.

Outcomes in activated B-cell diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL) remain poor and new targets for treatment are needed. NF-kB signalling pathways from the B-cell receptor and Toll-like receptors bear mutations and are constitutively active in ABC-DLBCL but inhibitors of the major components of these signalling pathways have not yet entered clinical practice. The IKK related kinases, IKKe/TBK1, have essential roles in innate immunity and regulate aspects of NF-kB signalling and other pathways. TBK1 mRNA expression is associated with clinical outcome and TBK1 and IKKe are variably expressed in human DLBCL. We explored the effects of small molecule IKKe/TBK1 inhibitors on DLBCL cell lines. Gene expression differences due to drug treatment were determined in both DMX3433 sensitive and resistant cell lines. GSEA showed four biologically relevant gene sets: \"TNFa signalling via NF-kB\" (MSigDB M5890) \"Inflammatory Response\" (MSigDB M10617), \"Oxidative phosphorylation\" (MSigDB M5936) and \"IFNA response\" (MSigDB M5911).

Talactoferrin has demonstrated anti-cancer activity in preclinical studies and in Phase III clinical trials in patients with Renal Cell Cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. We have shown that TLF induces the maturation of human DCs derived from monocytes, suggesting that the linkage of the innate and adaptive immunity through DC maturation is a key immune function mediated by TLF. In this study we used genome-wide expression analysis to explore the mechanisms by which TLF leads to the functional maturation of DC. We show that GMP level recombinant TLF activates human DCs in a Toll-like receptor (TLR) -2 and -4 dependent manner.

Mutations of the KRAS oncogene are predictive for resistance to treatment with antibodies against the epithelial growth factor receptor in patients with colorectal cancer. Overcoming this therapeutic dilemma could potentially be achieved by the introduction of drugs that inhibit signaling pathways that are activated by KRAS mutations. To comprehensively identify such signaling pathways we profiled pretreatment biopsies from 65 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer - 30 of which carried mutated KRAS - using global gene expression microarrays. By comparing all tumor tissues exclusively to matched normal mucosa, we could improve assay sensitivity, and identified a total of 22,297 features that were differentially expressed (adjusted p-value p<0.05) between normal mucosa and cancer, including several novel potential rectal cancer genes. We then used this comprehensive description of the rectal cancer transcriptome as the baseline for identifying KRAS-dependent alterations. The presence of activating KRAS mutations resulted in significant upregulation of 13 genes (adjusted p-value < 0.05), among them DUSP4, a MAP-kinase phosphatase, and SMYD3, a histone methyltransferase. Inhibition of the expression of both genes has been achieved therapeutically with the MEK1-inhibitor PD98059 and the antibacterial compound Novobiocin, respectively, suggesting a potential approach to overcome resistance to treatment with antibodies against the epithelial growth factor receptor in patients with KRAS-mutant rectal carcinomas.

They are the most important antigen presenting cells in the immune system. DC can be divided in immature and mature DC. DCs reside in an immature state in most tissues or they circulate in the blood, where they recognize and phagocytose pathogens and other antigens. Direct contact with many pathogens leads to the maturation of DCs. The property to stimulate T cells is reserved for mature DC (O'Doherty, U. 1994). This functional maturation results in an up-regulation of the surface molecule MHC class II, adhesion molecules (CD54 and CD58) and co-stimulatory receptors (CD80 and CD86) as well as decreased antigen uptake capacity (CD206). (Banchereau, J. and Steinman, R.M. 1998). Immunosuppressive drugs have revolutionized organ transplantation and improved the therapeutic management of autoimmune diseases. These drugs interfere on lymphocytes but they also act at the earliest stage of immune response. They are targeting key functions of dendritic cells (Hackstein H. and Thomson A.W., 2004 review). Sanglifehrin A (SFA) is a new immunosuppressive drug. It is a representative of a class of macrolides produced by the actinomycetes strain Streptomyces A92-308110 that bind to cyclophilin A (CypA), the binding protein of cyclosporine A (CsA). Most studies about immunosuppressive effects of SFA took place on T and B lymphocytes. Unlike CsA, the cyclophilin-SFA-complex shows no effect on the calcium-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (Zenke, G. 2001). Unlike CsA and FK506, SFA shows no inhibition of IL-2 expression (Zenke, G. 2001; Zhang, L.H. 2001), nor does it suppress IL-2 receptor transcription (Zhang, L.H. 2001) in T lymphocytes. It could be shown that SFA reduces the Interleukin 12 production in dendritic cells (Steinschulte, C. 2003). IL-12p70 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammation and autoimmune diseases. DCs generated in the presence of SFA show reduced macropinocytosis and lectin-mediated endocytosis. In contrast, CD89 und CD32 were increased by SFA. The effect of SFA on the expression of Ag uptake receptors and Ag capture by DCs makes SFA unique among other immunophilin-binding immunosuppressive drugs (Woltman, A. 2004). Our goal is to investigate the gene expression profile of SFA treated mature human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Comparison of SFA-stimulated versus unstimulated cells. 7 biological replicates.",

Previously we showed that efficient H3K4 methylation plays an essential role in the differentiation and long-term maintenance of adult hematopoietic stem cell. However, its role in fetal hematopoiesis is unknown. Here, we show that loss of Dpy30, a core subunit of Set1/Mll complexes that responsible for efficient global H3K4 methylation, in FL results in embryonic anemia as well as the accumulation of HSCs that are defective in multiple lineage reconstitution as shown in mixed chimera assays. Global gene expression analyses identified 21 genes co-downregulated by Dpy30 loss in FL and BM HSCs, among which we further demonstrate that Igdcc4 and Ntpcr are important for efficient colony formation capacity of both FL and BM HSCs in vitro.

As disease-modifying therapies are not available, novel therapeutic targets need to be discovered and prioritized for their importance in mediating the abnormal phenotype of cells in OA-affected joints. Here, we generated a genome-wide molecular profile of OA to elucidate regulatory mechanisms of OA pathogenesis and to identify possible therapeutic targets using integrative analysis of mRNA-sequencing data obtained from human knee cartilage.Methods:RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on 18 normal and 20 OA human knee cartilage tissues.

Pathway analysis identified 15 significantly perturbed pathways in OA with ECM-related, PI3K-Akt, HIF-1, FoxO and circadian rhythm pathways being the most significantly dysregulated. We selected differentially expressed TFs that are enriched for regulating DE genes in OA and prioritized these transcription factors by creating a cartilage-specific interaction subnetwork.

Urothelial cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) were analyzed for alterations of the PI3K pathway and for their sensitivity to the small molecule inhibitor pictilisib alone and in combination with cisplatin and/or gemcitabine. Potential predictive biomarkers for pictilisib were evaluated and RNA-sequencing was performed to explore drug resistance mechanisms. The bladder cancer cell line TCCSUP, which harbors a PIK3CA E545K mutation, was sensitive to pictilisib compared to cell lines with wild type PIK3CA. Pictilisib exhibited stronger anti-tumor activity in bladder cancer PDX models with PI3KCA H1047R mutation or amplification than a model with wild-type. Pictilisib synergized with cisplatin and/or gemcitabine in vitro, significantly delayed tumor growth and prolonged survival compared with single drug targeted treatment in the PDX models. The phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 correlated with response to pictilisib both in vitro and in vivo, and could potentially serve as biomarker to predict response to pictilisib. The inhibitor activated the compensatory MEK/ERK pathway that likely contributed to pictilisib resistance, which was reversed by co-treatment with the RAF inhibitor sorafenib. RNA-sequencing of tumors resistant to treatment suggested that LSP1 down-regulation might play a role in inducing drug resistance. These preclinical results provide new insight into the therapeutic potential of targeting the PI3K pathway for the treatment of bladder cancer.

LncRHOXF1 knockdown using siRNAs in human trophectoderm progenitors increased expression of viral response genes, including type I interferon. Sendai virus infection of human trophectoderm progenitor cells increased lncRHOXF1 RNA levels and siRNA-mediated disruption of lncRHOXF1 during infection reduced the expression of viral response genes leading to higher virus replication. Thus, lncRHOXF1 RNA is the first example of a lncRNA that regulates the host response to viral infections in human placental progenitor cells, and we propose that it functions as a repressor of the viral response during early human development. Undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (HUES9) containing the lncRHOXF1 and rtTA3 cDNAs inserted into the AAVS locus of chromosome 19 were used in overexpression experiments RNA was isolated from triplicate wells for analysis by Illumina microarray.",

    "text": "Expression Profiling of Early Myogenesis - Illumina Dataset. Myogenesis is a tightly controlled process involving the transcriptional activation and repression of thousands of genes. Although many components of the transcriptional network are known for the later phases of myogenesis, relatively little work has described the transcriptional landscape within the first 24 hours, when myoblasts commit to differentiate. Through dense temporal sampling of differentiating C2C12 myoblasts, we identify 266 transcriptional regulators (TRs) whose expression is altered within the first 12 hours of myogenesis. A high-content shRNA screen of 76 TRs involving 427 stable lines identified 48 genes whose knockdown significantly inhibits differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. These include known regulators of myogenesis (Myod1, Myog and Myf5), as well as 26 regulators not previously associated with the process. Of the TRs differentially expressed within the first 24 hours, two-thirds inhibited differentiation when knocked down. Surprisingly, a similar proportion (67%) of shRNAs targeting TRs whose expression did not change during differentiation also inhibited myogenesis, suggesting that both stably and differentially expressed TRs are essential for this complex differentiation program. This implies that microarray-based approaches that concentrate functional validation studies on differentially-expressed genes will fail to identify many genes that are critically implicated in complex biological processes. C2C12 myoblasts were differentiated into myotubes and sampled at various timepoints for gene expression measurement on Illumina Mouse WG-6v1.1 arrays. Cells grown in separate plates were harvested at 12 different timepoints: t_0h, t_1h, t_1.5h, t_2h, t_3h, t_6h, t_9h, t_12h, t_24h, t_48h, t_96h, t_144h.

A strong host genetic contribution to leprosy susceptibility is well established. However, the modulation of the transcriptional response to infection and the mechanism(s) of disease control are poorly understood. To address this gap in knowledge of leprosy pathogenicity, we conducted a genome-wide search for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) that are associated with transcript variation -- before and after stimulation with M. leprae sonicate in whole blood cells. We show that M. leprae antigen stimulation mainly triggered the upregulation of immune related genes and that a substantial proportion of the differential gene expression is genetically controlled. Indeed, using stringent criteria, we identified 318 genes displaying cis-eQTL at an FDR of 0.01, including 66 genes displaying response-eQTL (reQTL), i.e. cis-eQTL that showed significant evidence for interaction with the M. leprae stimulus. Such reQTL correspond to regulatory variations that affect the interaction between human whole blood cells and M. leprae sonicate, and thus likely between the human host and M. leprae bacilli. We found that reQTL are significantly enriched among binding sites of transcription factors that are activated in response to infection, and that they were enriched among single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with susceptibility to leprosy per se and Type-I Reaction, as well as SNPs targeted by recent positive selection. Our study suggests that natural selection shaped our genomic diversity to face pathogen exposure including M. leprae infection. 51 unrelated individuals from Vietnam diagnosed with borderline leprosy were recruited. Whole blood was obtained from each subject in two aliquots of 10mL, one was stimulated with Mycobacterium leprae sonicate, the other remained untreated for 26-32 hours. Total RNA were extracted.",

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is an autoimmune disease that localizes to the skin and is known to contain elevated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on Hale's stain of skin biopsy specimens. Recently, different GAG species have been shown to have distinct effects on the recruitment and activation of immune cells and stimulation of cytokine production (Taylor and Gallo, FASEB, 2006; 20: 9-22). Thus, we speculate that the elevated GAGs observed in CLE play a role in the local inflammatory process that produces skin lesions in these patients. In order to further investigate a molecular basis for the elevated expression of these GAGs in CLE skin lesions, we would like to determine the gene expression profiles of GAG synthesis, degradation, and modifier genes in lesional and non-lesional skin samples from CLE patients and compare to those from healthy controls. A microarray approach will give us a broader understanding of the genetic regulation of the expression of various GAG species in CLE skin. We will then be able to target future quantitative gene expression experiments by real-time RT-PCR to the genes that are shown to be involved in CLE. In order to accomplish our goal, we would like to examine the GAG gene expression profiles of DLE, TLE, and SCLE subtypes due to the differences in CS and HA staining that we found among these subtypes. Since HA and CS are elevated in DLE and HA in TLE, but not in SCLE, the SCLE samples will also serve as an internal control. We would like to examine both lesional and non-lesional skin biopsies to determine if CLE skin prior to developing a lesion is different at the genetic level from healthy control skin and how it changes once a lesion does develop.We will separate the dermis from the epidermis of the skin biopsies and extract RNA just from the dermis to enrich for dermal fibroblast RNA. We aim to submit four patient biopsies per subtype as well as four samples from healthy control skin for comparison. This number is necessary in order to account for the biologic variability among different patients. We would submit more samples per subtype but are limited by availability of patients in clinic. Thus, we will have a total of 28 samples to submit for microarray.

White adipose tissue (WAT) is a highly active metabolic and endocrine organ, and its dysfunction links obesity to a variety of diseases, ranging from type 2 diabetes to cancer. The function of WAT is under the control of multiple cell signaling systems, including that of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Gas- and Gai-coupled receptors have been reported to regulate lipolysis, and Gaq-coupled receptors stimulate glucose uptake in adipocytes. However, the roles of Ga12/13-coupled receptors in WAT are totally unknown. Here we show that lysophosphatidic acid receptor 4 (LPA4), an adipose cluster GPCR, selectively activates Ga12/13 proteins in adipocytes, and limits continuous remodeling and healthy expansion of WAT in mice. Under standard diet conditions, LPA4-knockout mice showed higher expression levels of mitochondrial biogenesis-related genes in WAT, along with higher production of adiponectin than control mice. In vitro studies have consistently demonstrated that the LPA4/Rho/Rho-kinase signaling pathway suppresses mRNA expression of mitochondrial biogenesis-related genes in adipocytes. In a diet-induced obesity model, LPA4-deficient mice showed \"metabolically healthy obese\" phenotypes, with continuous WAT expansion, and protection from WAT inflammation, hepatosteatosis, and insulin resistance. Given that GPCRs comprise the most successful class of drug targets, LPA4 would be a promising therapeutic target for obesity-related metabolic disorders. LPA4-knockout (LPA4-KO) and wild type (WT) mice were housed on a 12-h light dark cycle and fed standard chow (MF [Oriental Yeast Co., Tokyo, Japan]) diet.

We performed the circadian transcriptome analysis using the skeletal muscle from sedentary and exercised mice either in the early rest phase (ZT3) or in the early active phase (ZT15). By the combination with circadian transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis, we revealed time-of-day-dependent remodeling of circadian muscular metabolic pathways involved in glucose and glycerol metabolism after exercise. We found that only exercise in the early active phase elevates the levels of genes encoding glycolytic enzymes followed by the activation of fatty acid oxidation, branched-chain amino acid catabolism and ketogenesis/ketosis. This study demonstrates that time-of-day is a critical factor to modulate the impact of exercise on metabolic pathways within skeletal muscle.

The expression profiles of NEM, AEH, and EEC were compared by using GeneChip Array. The expression of dysregulated genes was first validated by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (SQ RT-PCR). The gene expression levels were determined by real time reverse transcriptase PCR (RTQ RT-PCR) in 85 EEC patients as the training test and 84 EEC patients as the testing test.

The Adherens Junction protein p120-catenin is implicated in the regulation of cadherin stability, cell migration and inflammatory responses in mammalian epithelial tissues. How these events are coordinated to promote wound repair is not understood. We show that p120-catenin regulates the intrinsic migratory properties or primary mouse keratinocytes, but also influences the migratory behavior of neighboring cells by secreted signals. These events are rooted in the ability of p120-catenin to regulate RhoA-GTPase activity, which leads to a two-tiered control of cell migration. One restrains cell motility via increase of actin stress fibers, reduction in integrin turnover, and an increase in focal adhesions robustness. The other is coupled to the secretion of inflammatory cytokines including Interleukin-24, which causally enhances randomized cell movements. Taken together, our results indicate that p120-RhoA-GTPase-mediated signaling can differentially regulate the migratory behavior of epidermal cells, which has potential implications for chronic wound responses and cancer. Total RNA from the backskin of p120L/L -K5Cre+/+ or p120D/D -K5Cre+/T mouse embryos (E18.5) was isolated. The RNA quality (between 6.7 to 8.8) was confirmed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.

MCF7 shared 67.3% and 59.5% of the DE genes with Cd7 and Cd12 cells, respectively, suggesting that ERa continues to play an important role in regulating the expression of genes following chronic cadmium exposure. 138 ERE genes (76.7%) were shared by all three cell lines, in that expression changed in the same direction (either up- or downregulated). For the estrogen-responsive genes, 428 (53.6%) of the 799 genes were altered in the same direction in all three cell lines. These findings show that while a majority of ERE genes responded in the same manner to loss of ERa, more variability existed within the estrogen-responsive genes.

The epidermal specific ablation of Trp53 gene leads to the spontaneous development of aggressive tumors in mice through a process that is accelerated by the simultaneous ablation of Rb gene. Since alterations of p53-dependent pathway are common hallmarks of aggressive, poor prognostic human cancers, these mouse models can recapitulate the molecular features of some of these human malignancies. To evaluate this possibility, gene expression microarray analysis was performed in mouse samples. The mouse tumors display increased expression of cell cycle and chromosomal instability associated genes. Remarkably, they are also enriched in human embryonic stem cell gene signatures, a characteristic feature of human aggressive tumors. Using cross-species comparison and meta-analytical approaches, we also observed that spontaneous mouse tumors display robust similarities with gene expression profiles of human tumors bearing mutated TP53, or displaying poor prognostic outcome, from multiple body tissues.

Based on expression of the WIPF1 signature, we classified more than 400 additional tumors with microarray data from our own experiments or from publicly available data sets according to their WIPF1 signature expression. This allowed us to separate patient populations for colorectal cancers, breast cancers, and gliomas for which clinical characteristics like survival times and times to relapse were analyzed. Groups of colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and glioma patients with low expression of the WIPF1 co-expression module generally had a favorable prognosis. In addition, the majority of WIPF1 signature genes are individually correlated with disease outcome in different studies. Literature gene network analysis revealed that among WIPF1 co-expressed genes known direct transcriptional targets of c-myc, ESR1 and p53 are enriched. The mean expression profile of WIPF1 signature genes is correlated with the profile of a proliferation signature. The WIPF1 signature is the first microarray-based prognostic expression signature primarily developed for colorectal cancer that is instrumental in other tumor types: low expression of the WIPF1 module is associated with better prognosis.We used microarrays for the validation of a WIPF1 co-expression module which was developed on two publically available datasets.Keywords: disease state analysis. For the generation of our own microarray data set, 62 CRC patients undergoing elective standard oncological resection at the Department of General, Vascular and Thoracic Surgery, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite, were prospectively recruited.",

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binds the human genome at >10,000 sites, but only regulates the expression of hundreds of genes. To determine the functional effect of each site, we measured the glucocorticoid (GC) responsive activity of nearly all GR binding sites (GBSs) captured using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in A549 cells. 13% of GBSs assayed had GC-induced activity. The responsive sites were defined by direct GR binding via a GC response element (GRE) and exclusively increased reporter- gene expression. Meanwhile, most GBSs lacked GC-induced reporter activity. The non-responsive sites had epigenetic features of steady state enhancers and clustered around direct GBSs. Together, our data support a model in which clusters of GBSs observed with ChIP-seq reflect interactions between direct and tethered GBSs over tens of kilobases. We further show that those interactions can synergistically modulate the activity of direct GBSs, and may therefore play a major role in driving gene activation in response to GCs. Glucoroticoid receptor binding site chip-seq libraries were cloned into STARR-seq for massively parallel functional analysis. The results were confirmed by ChIP-Exo performed on the GR in A549 cells treated with 100 nM dexamethasone for one hour.This dataset [1] contains rna seq from BAC DNA tagments (nucleic acids that have been treated with Nextera transposase to fragment the nucleic acids and add sequencing adapters) cloned into the STARR-seq plasmid backbone, transfected into A549 cells and treated with DEX or ETOH.",

The Polycomb group (PcG) gene products mediate heritable silencing of developmental regulators in metazoans, participating in one of two distinct multimeric protein complexes, the Polycomb repressive complexes-1 (PRC1) and -2 (PRC2)1. PRC2 catalyses trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27) which in turn is thought to provide a recruitment site for PRC1. Recent studies demonstrate that mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2A at lysine 119 is important in PcG mediated silencing with the core PRC1 component Ring1A/B functioning as the E3 ligase8. PRC2 has been shown to share target genes with the core transcription network to maintain embryonic stem (ES) cells including Oct4 and Nanog9. Here we identify an essential role for PRC1 in repressing developmental regulators in ES cells, and thereby in maintaining ES cell pluripotency. A significant proportion of the PRC1 target genes are also repressed by Oct4. We demonstrate that engagement of PRC1 and PRC2 at target genes is Oct4-dependent and moreover that Ring1B interacts with Oct4. Collectively these results show that PcG complexes are instrumental in Oct4-dependent repression required to maintain pluripotency of ES cells.

Transplantation with low numbers of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), found in many of the publically accessible cryopreserved umbilical cord blood (UCB) units, leads to delayed time to engraftment, high graft failure rates, and early mortality in many patients. A chemical screen in zebrafish identified the prostaglandin compound, 16,16 dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2), to be a critical regulator of hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis. We hypothesized that an ex vivo modulation with dmPGE2 prior to transplantation would lead to enhanced engraftment by increasing the \"effective\" dose of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in cord blood. A phase I trial of reduced-intensity double UCB transplantation was performed to evaluate safety, rates of engraftment and fractional chimerism of dmPGE2 enhanced UCB units.

Rationale: The acute respiratory distress syndrome is refractory to pharmacological intervention. Inappropriate activation of alveolar neutrophils is believed to underpin this disease's complex pathophysiology, yet these cells have been little studied.Objectives: To examine the functional and transcriptional profiles of patient blood and alveolar neutrophils compared to healthy volunteer cells, and define their sensitivity to phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibition.Methods: Twenty three ventilated patients underwent bronchoalveolar lavage. Alveolar and blood neutrophil apoptosis, phagocytosis and adhesion molecules were quantified by flow cytometry, and oxidase responses by chemiluminescence. Cytokine and transcriptional profiling utilized multiplex and GeneChip arrays.Measurements and Main Results: Patient blood and alveolar neutrophils were distinct from healthy circulating cells, with increased CD11b and reduced CD62L expression, delayed apoptosis and constitutively primed oxidase responses. Incubating control cells with disease bronchoalveolar lavage recapitulated the aberrant functional phenotype and this could be reversed by phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors. In contrast, the pro-survival phenotype of patient cells was recalcitrant to phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibition. RNA transcriptomic analysis revealed modified immune, cytoskeletal and cell death pathways in patient cells, aligning closely to sepsis and burns data sets but not with phosphoinositide 3-kinase signatures.Conclusions: Acute respiratory distress syndrome blood and alveolar neutrophils display a distinct primed, pro-survival profile and transcriptional signature. The enhanced respiratory burst was phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent, but delayed apoptosis and the altered transcriptional profile were not. These unexpected findings cast doubt over the utility of phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibition in acute respiratory distress syndrome and highlight the importance of evaluating novel therapeutic strategies in patient-derived cells. 94 samples in total.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer with limited treatment options. Familial predisposition to PDAC occurs in ~10% of cases, but causative genes have not been identified in most families. Uncovering the genetic basis for PDAC susceptibility has immediate prognostic implications for families and can provide mechanistic clues to PDAC pathogenesis. Here, we perform whole-genome sequence analysis in a family with multiple cases of PDAC and identify a germline nonsense mutation in the member of RAS oncogene family-like 3 (RABL3) gene never before directly associated with hereditary cancer. The truncated mutant allele (RABL3_p.S36*) co-segregates with cancer occurrence. To evaluate the contribution of the RABL3 mutant allele in hereditary cancer, we generated rabl3 heterozygous mutant zebrafish and found increased susceptibility to cancer formation in two independent cancer models. Unbiased approaches implicate RABL3 in RAS pathway regulation: the transcriptome of juvenile rabl3 mutants reveals a KRAS upregulation signature, and affinity-purification mass spectrometry for proteins associated with RABL3 or RABL3_p.S36* identifies Rap1 GTPase-GDP Dissociation Stimulator 1 (RAP1GDS1, SmgGDS), a chaperone that regulates prenylation of RAS GTPases. Indeed, we find that RABL3_p.S36* accelerates KRAS prenylation and requires RAS proteins to promote cell proliferation. Furthermore, rabl3 homozygous mutant zebrafish develop severe craniofacial, skeletal, and growth defects consistent with human RASopathies, and these defects are partially rescued with the MEK inhibitor trametinib. Finally, we identify additional germline mutations in RABL3 that impact RAS activity in vivo and have a significant burden in a cohort of patients with developmental disorders, suggesting a role in undiagnosed RASopathies. Moreover, RABL3 is upregulated in multiple human PDAC cell lines and knockdown abrogates proliferation, consistent with a broader role for RABL3 in PDAC.

The response of cells to hypoxia is characterised by co-ordinated regulation of many genes. Studies of the regulation of the expression of many of these genes by oxygen has implicated a role for the heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). The mechanism of oxygen sensing which controls this heterodimeric factor is via oxygen dependent prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation by specific 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases (PHD1, PHD2, PHD3 and FIH-1). Whilst HIF appears to have a major role in hypoxic regulation of gene expression, it is unclear to what extent other transcriptional mechanisms are also involved in the response to hypoxia. The extent to which 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases are responsible for the oxygen sensing mechanism in HIF-independent hypoxic gene regulation is also unclear. Both the prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylases can be inhibited by dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG). Such inhibition can produce activation of the HIF system with enhanced transcription of target genes and might have a role in the therapy of ischaemic disease. We have examined the extent to which the HIF system contributes to the regulation of gene expression by hypoxia, to what extent 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase inhibitor can mimic the hypoxic response and the nature of the global transcriptional response to hypoxia. We have utilised microarray assays of mRNA abundance to examine the gene expression changes in response to hypoxia and to DMOG. We demonstrate a large number of hypoxically regulated genes, both known and novel, and find a surprisingly high level of mimicry of the hypoxic response by use of the 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase inhibitor, dimethyloxalylglycine. We have also used microarray analysis of cells treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha to demonstrate the differing contributions of each transcription factor to the transcriptional response to hypoxia. Candidate transcripts were confirmed using an independent microarray platform and real-time PCR. The results emphasise the critical role of the HIF system in the hypoxic response, whilst indicating the dominance of HIF-1alpha and defining genes that only respond to HIF-2alpha.Keywords: Hypoxia response, gene knockdown, chemical treatment.

An important regulatory step of muscle adaptation to RE is gene expression. Microarray analysis can be used as an exploratory method to investigate how genes and gene clusters are modulated acutely and chronically by RE. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of training status in the basal (rested) and pre- to 24h post-RE on the global transcriptome in vastus lateralis muscle biopsies of young men. Muscle biopsies of nine young men who undertook RE training for 10-wks were collected pre and 24h post-RE at the first (W1) and last (W10) weeks of training and analysed using microarray. An unaccustomed RE bout (at W1) up-regulated muscle gene transcripts related to stress (e.g., heat shock proteins), damage and inflammation, structural remodelling, protein turnover and increased translational capacity. Trained muscles (at W10) became more efficient metabolically, as training favoured a more oxidative metabolism, refined response to stress, showed by genes suppression related to RE-induced stress and inflammation, and up-regulated genes indicating greater muscle contractile efficiency and contribution to promote muscle growth and development. These data highlight that chronic repetition of RE increases muscle efficiency and adapt muscles to respond more specifically and accurately to RE-induced stress. A total of 36 skeletal muscle biopsies of nine young men who undertook RE training for 10-wks were collected pre and 24h post-RE at the first and last weeks of training and analysed using microarray.",

Although a number of animal model studies have addressed changes in gene expression in the parenchyma and their relationship to emphysema, much less is known about the pathogenesis of cigarette smoke-induced small airway remodeling. In this study, we exposed rat tracheal explants to whole smoke for 15 minutes, and then cultured the explants in air. The airway transcriptome was evaluated using RAE 230_2 GeneChips. By 2 hours after starting smoke exposure, expression levels of 502 genes were changed up or down by more than 1.5 times (p values <0.01 or less), and by 24 hours, 1870 genes were significantly changed up or down. These included genes involved in anti-oxidant protection, epithelial defense and remodeling, inflammatory mediators and transcription factors, and a number of unexpected genes including the MMP-12 inducer, tachykinin-1 (substance P). Pre-treatment of the explants with 1 x 10-7 M dexamethasone reduced the number of significantly changed genes by approximately 47% at 2 hr and 68% at 24 hours, and in almost all instances, reduced the magnitude of the smoke-induced changes. We conclude that even a very brief exposure to cigarette smoke can lead to rapid changes in the expression of a large number of genes in rat tracheal explants, and that these effects are directly mediated by smoke, without a need for exogenous inflammatory cells. Steroids, contrary to the usual belief, are able to ameliorate many of these changes, at least in this very acute model. 4x tracheal explants (approx 2-3ug) from each rat (n=6 rats) exposed to control (air), smoke (10 puffs of cigarette smoke, delivered during 15 mins), dexamethasone and dexamethasone + cigarette smoke were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Rat230_2 Affymetrix microarrays. 1 rat, 4 explants and 4 conditions. n=6 rats per group/condition at 2hrs, n=6 rats per group/condition at 24hrs. 12 animals = 48 samples total (47 went into analysis because 1 sample failed QC metrics).",

We demonstrate the utility of this AAV to target a variety of genetically and anatomically defined neural populations expressing Cre recombinase and illustrate the ability of this viral TRAP (vTRAP) approach to recapitulate the molecular profiles obtained by bacTRAP in corticothalamic neurons across multiple serotypes. Furthermore, spatially restricting AAV injections enabled the elucidation of regional differences in gene expression within this cell type. Taken together, these results establish the broad applicability of the vTRAP strategy for the molecular dissection of any CNS or peripheral cell type that can be engineered to express Cre. Polysome-bound mRNAs from TRAP IPs were compared to whole tissue mRNAs. Data was collected from MCH neurons in hypothalamus using vTRAP, cortical layer 6 Ntsr1 neurons using vTRAP, and cortical layer 6 Ntsr1 neurons using bacTRAP.

The objective of this study was to compare the transcriptional repertoire of mature human neutrophils before and after GM-CSF treatment by using oligonucleotide microarrays.Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is an important pro-inflammatory lipid mediator generated by neutrophils upon activation. Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stimulation is known to enhance agonist-mediated LTB4 production of neutrophils within minutes, a process called \"priming\". Here, we demonstrate that GM-CSF also limits the production of LTB4 by neutrophils via a transcriptional mechanism at later time points. We identified hematopoietic specific Ras homologous (RhoH)/translocation three four (TTF), which was induced following GM-CSF stimulation in neutrophils, as a key regulator in this process. Neutrophils derived from RhoH/TTF-deficient (Rhoh-/-) mice demonstrated increased LTB4 production upon activation compared with normal mouse neutrophils. Moreover, neutrophils from cystic fibrosis patients expressed enhanced levels of RhoH/TTF and generated less LTB4 upon activation compared with normal human neutrophils. Taken together, these data suggest that RhoH/TTF represents an inducible feedback inhibitor in neutrophils that is involved in the limitation of innate immune responses. 3 healthy donors' blood were used for each group. Two groups were created. One group (\"untreated\"=N ) the RNA were extracted immediately after isolation of blood neutrophil.

The anti-epileptic drug zonisamide is reported to exert beneficial effects in patients with Parkinson's disease. To elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the anti-parkinsonism effects of zonisamide, we examined the effect of zonisamide co-administered with levodopa in the striata of rats with 6-hydoroxydopamine hemiparkinsonism by using a DNA microarray for genome-wide gene expression profiling. We found that the expression of some genes related to metabolism and nervous system development and function were upregulated by zonisamide; expression of these genes was downregulated by levodopa. Furthermore, many genes related to the immune system and inflammation were downregulated by zonisamide, and their expression was upregulated by levodopa. These results indicate that zonisamide has a protective effect when co-administered with levodopa. Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital 240 mg/kg, i.p. and unilateral lesions of the left medial forebrain bundle were made via injection of 8 mg 6-OHDA hydrobromide in 4 ml of sterile saline containing 0.01% ascorbic acid.

However, precise process and molecular mechanism to induce epidermal fate are not clear. Med1 deficient dental epithelial stem cells exerts transcriptional program for skin epithelia reminiscent of the pattern in the skin. Epidermal transcripts were first induced prior to hair genes during dental epithelial differentiation, resemble to the pattern of embryonic developmental process of the skin. Hair genes was specifically induced at the anagen stage synchronized with hair cycling in the skin. Epidermal program was also induced in cultured adult stem cells called dental epithelial stem cell (DESC) that is derived from micro-dissected Med1 KO cervical loop tissues that are essential for continuous regeneration of mouse incisors. Gene expression profiles for the primary DESC with colony forming capability revealed that Med1 deletion suppressed Tgfb signaling by reducing the expression of ligands (Tgfb1, Inhibin ba), receptors and their extracellular targets such as Ctgf. Med1 deletion also induced Tgfb regulated reprogramming transcription factor, Klf4 that also known to drive transcription for epidermal genes. TGFb signaling was also suppressed in Med1 null epidermis in skin, in which epidermal fate was induced in hair follicle keratinocytes. Med1 silencing blocked expression of TGFb1 and suppressed both basal and recombinant TGFb induced Smad2/3 mediated transcription of TGFb target genes in vitro. These results demonstrate that Med1 deletion enhances epidermal transcriptional program in adult stem cells through regulation of TGFb signaling. n=3 CON and KO (each sample contain RNA extracted from cultured dental epithelial cells (DESC), which is isolated from cervical loop of Med1 KO and littermate control mice (3 mice each).",

The >10,000-fold increase in sensitivity over other many-to-all competing methods uncovered that active chromatin hubs identified in large input material, corresponding to 10 000 cells, flanking the MYC locus are primarily virtual. Thus, the close agreement between chromatin interactomes generated from aliquots corresponding to less than 10 cells with randomly re-sampled interactomes, we find that numerous distal enhancers positioned within flanking topologically associating domains (TADs) converge on MYC in largely mutually exclusive manners. Moreover, when comparing with several enhancer baits, the assignment of the MYC locus as the node with the highest dynamic importance index, indicates that it is MYC targeting its enhancers, rather than vice versa. Dynamic changes in the configuration of the boundary between TADs flanking MYC underlie numerous stochastic encounters with a diverse set of enhancers to depict the plasticity of its transcriptional regulation. Such an arrangement might increase the fitness of the cancer cell by increasing the probability of MYC transcription in response to a wide range of environmental cues encountered by the cell during the neoplastic process.

Uterine leiomyoma is the most common benign tumor of the female genital tract, and is the main cause of hysterectomy in 25-30% of affected women. Nevertheless, knowledge about stem cells initiating these common uterine tumors remains scarce.The side population method has been used to identify different somatic stem cells in the human body. In this context, our study explores the hypothesis that human leiomyoma side population cells could be the putative somatic stem cells responsible for leiomyoma's initiation and formation.We isolated, identified and characterized the side population cells from human leiomyomas which implies no commitment to the myometrial lineage at the molecular level, differential cloning efficiency under hypoxic conditions and provides a leiomyoma stem cells gene profile.Based on their cloning efficiency ability, we also established two cell lines (MyoSP1-2) with a normal karyotype under hypoxic conditions. The phenotype analysis supported their mesodermal commitment as assessed by the positive expression of typical mesenchymal markers, such as CD90, CD105, and CD73, and by the absence of hematopoietic stem cell markers like CD34 and CD45. At the mRNA level, we also confirmed their undifferentiated status (OCT-4+, NANOG+, DNMT3B+, GDF3+) and mesenchymal lineage commitment as demonstrated by their ability to differentiate in vitro into adipogenic and osteogenic lineages. Finally, we demonstrated the functional capability of Myo cell lines (MyoSP1-2) to form human leiomyoma-like tissue after injecting this subset of cells either under the kidney capsule or in the subcutaneous tissue in the NOD-SCID mice model. 4 replicates each of leiomyoma side population (SP) cells and leiomyoma total fraction (FT) cells were analyzed.",

The development of affinity purification technologies together with mass spectrometric analyses of the purified protein mixtures (AP-MS) has been used both to identify new protein-protein interactions and to define the subunit composition of protein complexes. Transcription factor protein interactions, however, have not been systematically analyzed using these approaches. Here, we have investigated whether ectopic expression of an affinity tagged transcription factor as bait in AP-MS experiments perturbs gene expression in cells resulting in false positive identification of bait associated proteins when typical experimental controls are used. Using quantitative proteomics and RNA-Seq, we determined that the increase in the abundance of a set of proteins caused by overexpression of the transcription factor RelA is not sufficient for these proteins to then copurify non-specifically and be misidentified as bait associated proteins. Therefore typical controls should be sufficient and a number of different baits can be compared with a common set of controls. This is of practical interest when identifying bait interactors from a large number of different baits. As expected, we found several known RelA interactors enriched in our RelA purifications (NFeB1, NFeB2, Rel, RelB, IeBa, IeBa and IeBa). We also found several proteins not previously described in association with RelA, including the small mitochondrial chaperone Tim13. Using a variety of biochemical approaches, we further investigated the nature of the association between Tim13 and NFeB family transcription factors. The work here therefore provides a conceptual and experimental framework for analyzing transcription faction protein interactions.

Up to 41% of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) result from activating mutations in the CTNNB1 gene encoding b-catenin. b-catenin has dual cellular functions as a component of the Wnt signaling pathway and adherens junctions. HCC-associated CTNNB1 mutations stabilize the b-catenin protein, leading to nuclear and/or cytoplasmic localization of b-catenin and downstream activation of Wnt target genes. In patient HCC samples, b-catenin nuclear and cytoplasmic localization are typically patchy, even among HCC with highly active CTNNB1 mutations. The functional and clinical relevance of this heterogeneity in b-catenin activation are not well understood. To define mechanisms of b-catenin-driven HCC initiation, we generated a Cre-lox system that enabled switching on activated b-catenin in 1) a small number of hepatocytes in early development; or 2) the majority of hepatocytes in later development or adulthood. We discovered that switching on activated b-catenin in a subset of larval hepatocytes was sufficient to drive HCC initiation. To determine the role of Wnt/b-catenin signaling heterogeneity later in hepatocarcinogenesis, we performed RNA-seq analysis of zebrafish b-catenin-driven HCC. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of differentially expressed genes in the Cre-lox HCC model revealed that \"Cancer\" and \"Liver Tumor\" categories were significantly altered, indicating transcriptional similarities with human HCC and other vertebrate HCC models. At the single-cell level, 2.9% to 15.2% of hepatocytes from zebrafish b-catenin-driven HCC expressed two or more of the Wnt target genes axin2, mtor, glula, myca, and wif1, indicating focal activation of Wnt signaling in established tumors.

Although gain of chromosome-5p is one of the most frequent DNA copy number imbalances in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), the genes that drive its selection remain poorly understood. In a previous cross-sectional clinical study we showed that the microRNA processor Drosha (located on chromosome-5p) demonstrates frequent copy-number gain and over-expression in cervical SCC, associated with altered microRNA profiles. Here, we have conducted gene depletion/over-expression experiments to demonstrate the functional significance of up-regulated Drosha in cervical SCC cells. Drosha depletion by RNA-interference (RNAi) produced significant, specific reductions in cell motility/invasiveness in vitro, with a silent RNAi-resistant Drosha mutation providing phenotype rescue. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering following global profiling of 319 microRNAs in eighteen cervical SCC cell line specimens generated two groups according to Drosha expression levels. Altering Drosha levels in individual SCC lines changed the group into which the cells clustered, with gene depletion effects being rescued by the RNAi-resistant mutation. Forty-five microRNAs showed significant differential expression between the groups, including four of fourteen that were differentially-expressed in association with Drosha levels in clinical samples. miR-31 up-regulation in Drosha over-expressing samples/cell lines was the highest-ranked change (by adjusted p-value) in both analyses, an observation validated by Northern blotting.

Myelin damage results in the electrical instability of A fibers and the ability to generate pain in response to light touch/pressure (mechanical allodynia). We have hypothesized and then established that the release of T cell epitopes of myelin basic protein (MBP) enables nociceptive circuitry in myelinated fibers. Thus, mass spectrometry analysis of the rat sciatic nerve proteome followed by bioinformatics examination of the datasets revealed a loss of MBP and activation of T-helper cell signaling in the nerves undergoing chronic constriction injury (CCI). Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) proteolysis resulted in the MBP digest peptides, including the MBP84-104 and MBP68-86 regions, which exhibit prominent immunogenic epitopes. Myelin-forming Schwann cells and paranodal areas accumulated MHCII, MMP-9 and the degraded MBP at the sciatic nerve injury site. Administration of the immunodominant MBP84-104 and MBP68-86 peptides but not of the control peptides in a naive rat sciatic nerve produced robust mechanical allodynia. Allodynia was accompanied by the T cell infiltration and an increase in MHCII, IL-17A and TNF- levels at the nerve injection site and the segmental ganglia. The pro-nociceptive activity of the synthetic MBP84-104 diminished in athymic nude rats lacking T cells. SB-3CT, an antagonist of MMP-9, inhibited mechanical allodynia, neuroinflammation and spinal sensitization after CCI.

Here, in the context of melanoma, we show that RNF2 is prognostic, exhibiting progression-correlated expression in human melanocytic neoplasms.Through a series of gain of function and loss of function studies, we establish that RNF2 is oncogenic and pro-metastatic. Mechanistically, RNF2-mediated invasive behavior is dependent on its ability to mono-ubiquitinate H2AK119 at the promoter of LTBP2, resulting in silencing of this negative regulator of TGFb signaling. In contrast, RNF2's oncogenic activity did not require its catalytic activity nor derives from its canonical gene repression function, rather RNF2 drives proliferation through direct transcriptional up-regulation of the cell cycle regulator CCND2. In summary, RNF2 regulates distinct biological processes in the genesis and progression of melanoma via distinct molecular mechanisms, underscoring the complex and multi-faceted actions of epigenetic regulators in cancer. RNF2 is overexpressed in immortalized human melanocytes HMEL-BRAFV600E to address impact of RNF2 overexpression in melanoma. GFP was overexpressed in HMEL-BRAFV600E cells as a control cell line.

Using ribosome profiling of the hippocampus, we find that ribosome footprint levels in Fmr1-deficient tissue mostly reflect changes in RNA abundance. Profiling over a time course of ribosome runoff in wildtype tissue reveals a wide range of ribosome translocation rates; on many mRNAs, the ribosomes are stalled. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of hippocampal slices after ribosome runoff reveals that FMRP co-sediments with stalled ribosomes; and its loss results in decline of ribosome stalling on specific mRNAs.

The aim of the study was to compare the two different costimuli anti-CD28 (costimulus 2a) and IL-2 (costimulus 2b) - in the presence of a suboptimal anti-CD3 signal (signal 1) - on the de novo activation of freshly purified human naive T cells.To this end, purified human naive T cells were co-incubated for seven days with a tumor vaccine which consisted of gamma-irradiated and Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV)-infected MCF-7 cells (a well-defined mammacarcinoma cell line). The gamma-irradiation dose was 200 Gray (Gy) to suppress the proliferation capacity of the vaccine cells (although the vaccine cells are not killed by such a procedure but still survive for several days); NDV-infection was performed at a dose of 100 hemagglutination units (HU) per 10^7 vaccine cells. The latter led - among others - to the upregulation of the viral surface molecules hemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN) and the fusion protein (F), both of which can serve for the attachment of fusion proteins delivering the activation signals to the naive T cells.The bispecific (bs) fusion proteins used in this study were of the single chain (scFv) format, binding with one arm to the viral HN molecule (for the attachment to the vaccine cells), and with the other arm either to the T cell receptor (TCR)-associated CD3 complex [as a surrogate of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-presented peptide recognized by the TCR] (bsHN-CD3), or to the costimulatory molecule CD28 (bsHN-CD28). Furthermore, a bispecific fusion protein containing the human interleukin (IL)-2 (bsHN-IL-2, a so-called immunocytokine) was used.The gene expression analysis of the differentially activated naive T cells revealed that in the presence of a suboptimal dose of anti-CD3 the two costimuli anti-CD28 (sample d7-S2_280705) and IL-2 (sample d7-S3_280705) led to a highly redundant pattern of gene upregulation in comparison to control samples in which naive T cells received only anti-CD3 (sample d7-S4_280705), anti-CD28 (sample d7-S5_280705) or IL-2 (sample d7-S6_280705) signals alone, or no signal at all (i.e. only vaccine cells; sample d7-S7_280705). All signals were compared to the reference sample which consisited of freshly isolated, non-activated naive T cells (sample d0-S1_280705).Global analysis of the gene expression showed that full naive T cell activation by anti-CD3/anti-CD28 and anti-CD3/IL-2 led to a significant upregulation of 76 and 71 genes, respectively (upregulation was considered to be significant if the relative gene expression was more than 5-fold than in the reference sample). However, the suboptimal anti-CD3 stimulus alone upregulated only 31 genes, the anti-CD28 stimulus alone only 6 genes, and the IL-2 stimulus alone only 22 genes. Naive T cells that reveived virus-modified vaccine cells alone upregulated 18 genes.Equally upregulated genes in anti-CD3/anti-CD28 and anti-CD3/IL-2 activated naive T cells comprised genes coding for both (i) signalling and (ii) effector molecules. Concerning signalling molecules, both costimuli induced the nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) pathway via the key enzymes protein kinase C (PKC)-theta and phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma 1, respectively. Of special note was that signalling molecules of the CD28-mediated stress-activated protein kinase (Sapk) pathway, namely Vav-1, Rac-1 and Jnk-2, were also upregulated by IL-2 costimulation. Upregulated genes coding for effector molecules could be classified into different functional groups: namely regulators of apoptosis, cell adhesion, receptors/ligands and cytokines/chemokines. Some examples of effector molecule-coding genes similarly upregulated in anti-CD3/anti-CD28 and anti-CD3/IL-2 stimulated naive T cells, respectively, were for instance the cell adhesion molecules LFA-1 and CD2, or members of the TNF and TNF receptor superfamilies such as CD27, CD70, CD40 ligand, Fas ligand, as well as TNF-alpha and TNF-beta (and their corresponding receptors). Among apoptosis-related genes, the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-XL as well as the pro-apoptotic gene caspase 9 were upregulated. The latter - together with the observed upregulation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes-associated protein (CTLA)-4 - might be interpreted as an indication of cellular events occurring seven days after stimulation which are aiming at termination of the response. Furthermore, the microarray analysis also revealed and upregulation of the receptor for interferon (IFN)-gamma inducible protein of 10 kDa (IP-10), namely CXCR3, of the IL-12 receptor beta-chain and of the IL-15 receptor alpha-chain; these are often seen in close association with T cell activation in general, with T cell proliferation and with generation of memory T cells. It is also of interest to mention the upregulation of beta-actin which is required for a re-organization of the cytoskeleton and the 40-fold upregulation of the metabolic enzyme glyceraldehye-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) which provides ATP necessary for the increased metabolism of the activated cells. A summary of the interesting gene subset is attached as a supplementary table (including the pairwise compared normalized data).In summary, these data suggest a synergism and cross-talk between the two costimulatory pathways mediated by anti-CD28/CD28 and IL-2/IL-2 receptor, respectively.Keywords: Human naive T cells, activation, costimulation, anti-CD28, IL-2, signal transduction, tumor vaccine, immunocytokine.

It is unknown whether ATXN2 associates preferentially with specific mRNAs or how it modulates their processing. Here, we investigated Atxn2 knock-out (Atxn2-/-) mouse liver, cerebellum and midbrain regarding their RNA profile, employing oligonucleotide microarrays for screening and RNA deep sequencing for validation. Modest ~1.4-fold upregulations were observed for the level of many mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and other translation pathway factors. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and immunoblots in liver tissue confirmed these effects and demonstrated an inverse correlation also with PABPC1 mRNA and protein. ATXN2 deficiency also enhanced phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6, while impairing the global protein synthesis rate, suggesting a block between the enhanced translation drive and the impaired execution. Furthermore, ATXN2 overexpression and deficiency retarded cell cycle progression. ATXN2 mRNA levels showed a delayed phasic twofold increase under amino acid and serum starvation, similar to ATXN3, but different from motor neuron disease genes MAPT and SQSTM1. ATXN2 mRNA levels depended particularly on mTOR signalling. Altogether the data implicate ATXN2 in the adaptation of mRNA translation and cell growth to nutrient availability and stress.

Tumor cells exhibit aberrant metabolism characterized by high glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen. This metabolic reprogramming, known as the Warburg effect, provides tumor cells with the substrates and redox potential required for the generation of biomass. Here, we show that the mitochondrial NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT3 is a crucial regulator of the Warburg effect. SIRT3 loss promotes a metabolic profile consistent with high glycolysis required for anabolic processes in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, SIRT3 mediates metabolic reprogramming independently of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and through HIF1a, a transcription factor that controls expression of key glycolytic enzymes. SIRT3 loss increases reactive oxygen species production, resulting in enhanced HIF1a stabilization. Strikingly, SIRT3 is deleted in 40% of human breast cancers, and its loss correlates with the upregulation of HIF1a target genes. Finally, we find that SIRT3 overexpression directly represses the Warburg effect in breast cancer cells. In sum, we identify SIRT3 as a regulator of HIF1a and a suppressor of the Warburg effect.

Progenitor cells maintain self-renewing tissues throughout life by sustaining their capacity for proliferation while suppressing cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation. DNA methylation provides a potential epigenetic mechanism for the cellular memory needed to preserve the somatic progenitor state through repeated cell divisions. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) maintains DNA methylation patterns after cellular replication. Although dispensable for embryonic stem cell maintenance, a clear role for DNMT1 in maintaining the progenitor state in constantly replenished somatic tissues, such as mammalian epidermis, is uncharacterized. Here we show that DNMT1 is essential for supporting epidermal progenitor cell function. DNMT1 protein was found enriched in undifferentiated cells, where it was required to retain proliferative stamina and suppress differentiation. In tissue, DNMT1 depletion led to exit from the progenitor cell compartment, premature differentiation and eventual tissue loss. These effects correlated with DNA methylation as genome-wide analysis revealed that a significant portion of epidermal differentiation gene promoters were methylated in self-renewing conditions but were subsequently demethylated during differentiation. Gene expression analysis: To establish a differentiation signature for primary human keratinocytes, total RNA was isolated in biologic duplicate from cells cultured in growth conditions and high calcium differentiation conditions and hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133 2.0 Plus arrays.

Stat1-null mice (129S6/SvEvTac-Stat1tm1Rds homozygous) uniquely develop estrogen-receptor-positive mammary tumors with incomplete penetrance and long latency. We studied the growth and development of the mammary glands in Stat1-null mice. Stat1-null MGs have faulty branching morphogenesis with abnormal terminal end buds. The Stat1-null MG also fails to sustain growth of 129S6/SvEv wild-type and null epithelium. These abnormalities are partially reversed by added progesterone and prolactin. Transplantation of wild-type bone-marrow into Stat1-null mice does not reverse the mammary gland developmental defects. Media conditioned by Stat1-null epithelium-cleared mammary fat pads does not stimulate epithelial proliferation whereas it is stimulated by conditioned media derived from either wild-type or progesterone and prolactin-treated Stat1-null epithelium-cleared mammary fat pads. Microarrays and multiplex cytokine protein assays showed that the mammary gland of Stat1-null mice had lower levels of growth factors that have been implicated in normal mammary gland growth and development.

Stat1-null hosts responded to tumor transplants with granulocytic infiltrates while wild-type hosts show a mononuclear response.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Obstruction and other processes that lead to renal damage can have different effects in adult versus developing kidneys. These differences are important for understanding pathophysiology, but also could influence selection of biomarkers used for detection of renal damage that could be used to guide intervention. In mice, significant renal development occurs postnatally, providing a model for understanding kidney development. To date, gene expression changes that occur mouse kidney growth and development postnatally have been poorly characterized. We describe here a comprehensive gene expression of the developing mouse kidney based on microarray profiling.METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed and kidneys were harvested at embryonic day E19.5, and postnatal days P1, P3, P5, P7, P10, P14, P21, P28 and P35. RNA was extracted from kidneys and transcript profiling was performed using Agilent microarrays. Transcripts that undergo abrupt transitions in expression level over the time course were identified using StepMiner analysis (Sahoo, 2007). Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was used to analyze the biological function and gene networks of gene expression data.RESULTS: Transcript levels for 13645 probes (representing 12769 genes) were modulated significantly over the time course, with 6949 up-regulated and 6696 down-regulated. IPA was used to identify genetic pathways, networks and functions significantly altered over the time course. Interestingly, in days P10 to P14 gene functions significantly altered were up-regulated exclusively with the functions represented including lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry and molecular transport. Between days P5 to P7 down-regulated genes predominated with enriched functions including, gene expression, cell cycle, protein synthesis and embryonic development. For P14 to P21 enriched functions included DNA replication, recombination and repair, cell cycle, tissue development, cellular assembly and organization, protein trafficking and cell morphology. In the late stages (P21 to P28) functional enrichment was seen for cell-to-cell signaling, tissue development, cellular movement.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the most comprehensive temporal survey of postnatal kidney development to date. This data set provides a framework for interpreting nephropathies, such as those induced by congenital obstruction. time series design.",

Polo like kinase 1 (Plk1) is a key mitotic kinase which controls centrosome separation. Here we found that Plk1 phosphorylated residue Thr76 in VCP/p97, an AAA-ATPase mainly involved in protein homeostasis, at centrosome from prophase to anaphase. This phosphorylation recruited VCP to centrosome to regulate centrosome orientation. VCP also exhibited strong co-localization with Eg5, a mitotic kinesin motor for centrosome movement, at mitotic spindle, and dephosphorylation of Thr76 in VCP was required for the enrichment of VCP and Eg5 to the spindle, thus, ensuring proper spindle orientation and chromosome segregation. Since genome instability is the hallmark of cancer and the phosphorylation of Thr76 in VCP is important for proper centrosome movement, spindle orientation, and chromosome segregation, we, thus, knocked down VCP in MDA-MB-231cells by its specific shRNA, and reconstituted the expression of VCP by infecting the cells with lentivirus encoding shRNA-resistant Flag-VCPWT or Flag-VCPT76A. We then implanted VCPWT- or VCPT76A-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells into nude mice and found that the tumor growth in mice implanted with VCPT76A-expressing cells was significantly slower when compared with the mice implanted with the Flag-VCPWT-expressing cells. To better understand the decreased tumor formation ability of Flag-VCPT76A-expressing cells, we isolated the primary breast tumor tissues for the RNA-Seq analysis.

Nine genes (ACSL1, BIRC3, CLC, CREM, ELTD1, FGG, S100A9, THBD, and TPD52L1) were progressively and significantly up-regulated from controls to quiescent non-dysplastic UC to UC with neoplasia.

The onset and progression of breast cancer are linked to genetic and epigenetic changes that alter the normal programming of cells. Epigenetic modifications of DNA and histones contribute to chromatin structure that results in the activation or repression of gene expression. Several epigenetic pathways have been shown to be highly deregulated in cancer cells. Targeting specific histone modifications represents a viable strategy to prevent oncogenic transformation, tumor growth or metastasis. Methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 has been extensively studied and shown to mark genes for expression; however this residue can also be acetylated and the specific function of this alteration is less well known. To define the relative roles of histone H3 methylation (H3K4me3) and acetylation (H3K4ac) in breast cancer, we determined genomic regions enriched for both marks in normal-like (MCF10A), transformed (MCF7) and metastatic (MDA-MB-231) cells using a genome-wide ChIP-Seq approach. Our data revealed a genome-wide gain of H3K4ac associated with both early and late breast cancer cell phenotypes, while gain of H3K4me3 was predominantly associated with late stage cancer cells. Enrichment of H3K4ac was overrepresented at promoters of genes associated with cancer-related phenotypic traits, such as estrogen response and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition pathways. Our findings highlight an important role for H3K4ac in predicting epigenetic changes associated with early stages of transformation.

Background: The development of a new drug from candidate to market is a complex process requiring vast resources of time, money and personnel. The rate of failure in the development pipeline is enormous, leading to wasted resources that could have been better employed on alternative candidates. The requirement for early stage prediction of toxicity is, then, of paramount importance to expedite the introduction of new therapies to clinical practice. To date, most transcriptomics efforts to solve this problem have applied Support Vector Machine techniques to data derived from in vivo studies in rats.Results: We applied a toxicogenomics approach to determine whether known renal toxicants could be identified as such from their effects on the transcriptome of the human renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line, HK-2. Based on clustering of differentially expressed genes, we identified 3 toxicity groups within the set of compounds. We used Random Forest to generate a classifier to accurately place compounds in groups. The classifier is based on a signature biomarker comprising 21 genes identified by Random Forest and could differentiate between the groups with high accuracy. Furthermore, we could correctly classify external samples from a dataset exhibiting a marked 'batch effect'.Conclusions: No toxicity-associated gene expression alterations could be identified across a set of toxic compounds. Random Forest is a suitable technique for the classification of compounds into toxicity groups. Using a measure of differential expression rather than expression level per se generates a robust classifier that can potentially be applied in a platform-independent manner. Gene expression changes in HK-2 cells were measured following exposure to 9 different compounds over a range of doses and time-points with the aim of finding biological signatures of toxicity. Clustering of the resulting gene expression data revealed 3 groups of nephrotoxic compounds (Tox 1, Tox 2 and Tox 3), each exhibiting their own distinct effect on HK-2 cells.This study measures gene expression changes following exposure to a high dose of Kbr or a control over 24 hrs or 48 hrs.

    "text": "Proteomic analysis of murine Piwi proteins reveals a role for arginine methylation in specifying interaction with Tudor family members. In germ cells, Piwi proteins interact with a specific class of small non-coding RNAs, piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Together, these form a pathway that represses transposable elements, thus safeguarding germ cell genomes. While basic models describe the operation of piRNA pathways, neither the protein compositions of Piwi complexes, the critical protein-protein interactions that drive small RNA production and target recognition, or the precise molecular consequences of conserved localization to germline structures, call nuage, is well understood. We purified the three murine Piwi family proteins, Mili, Miwi, and Miwi2, from mouse germ cells and characterized their interacting protein partners. Piwi proteins were found in complex with Prmt5/Wdr77, an enzyme that di-methylates arginine residues. By immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies and by mass spectrometry, we found that Piwi proteins are arginine methylated at conserved positions in their amino termini. These modifications are essential to direct complex formation with specific Tudor-domain proteins, whose interactions with Piwis can be required for localization of RNP complexes in cytoplasmic nuage, proper piRNA expression, and transposon silencing. Considered together, our findings indicate that arginine methylation drives the assembly of multi-protein machines whose integrity and specific sub-cellular localization is necessary for efficient function of the piRNA pathway.Keywords: gene regulation study.

The oncogenic transcription factor (c-)Myc is overexpressed in a variety of cancers including subtypes of B cell lymphoma. Here we study long noncoding (lnc)RNAs regulated by Myc, arguing that these lncRNAs may be involved in the very strong effect of Myc on cell proliferation. Using multiple in vitro models and taking into account the kinetics of the response to Myc as well as Myc binding sites we defined two Myc-induced and four Myc-repressed lncRNA candidates. Expression levels of the top Myc-induced lncRNA KTN1-AS1 are low in normal B cell subsets and strongly increased in multiple Myc-positive lymphoma cell lines. In addition, primary lymphoma cases stratified by high or low Myc expression show the expected KTN1-AS1 expression differences. Knockdown of KTN1-AS1 severely impaired the cell growth of multiple Burkitt lymphoma cell lines. Gene expression analysis showed that KTN1-AS1 knockdown affects >300 genes genome wide with a strong enrichment of Myc-target genes involved in metabolism and biosynthesis. In line with this finding, KTN1-AS1 depletion in B cell lymphoma cells caused a substantial decrease of Myc transcript and protein. Thus, our data indicates that KTN1-AS1 overexpression in lymphoma may reinforce high Myc expression at the transcriptional level to activate gene expression programs supporting the high metabolic rate present in lymphoma cells. In conclusion, we identified a novel positive feedback loop between c-Myc and KTN1-AS1 in B cell lymphoma cells. LncRNAs such as KTN1-AS1, that regulate important oncogenic factors in specific cell types, may open new ways to cancer therapy. Microarray gene expression analysis was performed in ST486 cells infected with 2 individual shRNAs targeting the lncRNA KTN1-AS1 or two non-targeting control shRNAs; samples were harvested at day 4 and day 6 post-infection.",

Dietary fat quality may influence skeletal muscle lipid handling and fat accumulation, thereby modulating insulin sensitivity. Objective: To examine acute effects of meals with various fatty acid (FA) compositions on skeletal muscle FA handling and postprandial insulin sensitivity in obese insulin resistant men. Design: In a single-blinded randomized crossover study, 10 insulin resistant men consumed three high-fat mixed-meals (2.6MJ). Meals were high in saturated FA (SFA), in monounsaturated FA (MUFA) or in polyunsaturated FA (PUFA). Fasting and postprandial skeletal muscle FA handling were examined by measuring arterio-venous concentration differences across forearm muscle. [2H2]-palmitate was infused intravenously to label endogenous triacylglycerol (TAG) and FFA in the circulation and [U-13C]-palmitate was added to the meal to label chylomicron-TAG. Skeletal muscle biopsies were taken to assess intramuscular lipid metabolism and gene expression. Results: Insulin and glucose responses (AUC) after SFA meal were significantly higher compared with PUFA meal (p=0.003 and 0.028, respectively). Uptake of TAG-derived FA was significantly lower in the early postprandial phase after PUFA meal as compared with other meals (AUC60-120, p<0.001). The PUFA meal induced less transcriptional downregulation of oxidative pathways compared with other meals. The fractional synthetic rate was higher in DAG and PL fraction after MUFA and PUFA meal. Conclusion: Intake of a PUFA meal reduced TAG-derived skeletal muscle FA uptake, which was accompanied by higher postprandial insulin sensitivity and a tendency towards a higher muscle lipid turnover. These data suggest that the effects of replacement of SFA by PUFA may contribute to less muscle lipid uptake and may be therefore protective against the development of insulin resistance.Keywords: expression profiling by array. randomized crossover dietary intervention study.",

Genes associated with naive pluripotency are transiently repressed in the transition from inner cell mass (ICM) to epiblast cells, followed by their upregulation soon after PGC specification. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the reactivation of pluripotency genes are poorly characterized. Here, we exploited in vitro differentiation of epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to elucidate the molecular and epigenetic functions of PR domain-containing 14 (PRDM14). We found that Prdm14 overexpression in EpiLCs induced their conversion to ESC-like cells even in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). This was impaired by the loss of Kruppel-like factor 2 (Klf2) and ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins. Furthermore, PRDM14 recruited OCT3/4 to the enhancer regions of naive pluripotency genes via TET-base excision-repair-mediated demethylation. Our results provide evidence that PRDM14 establishes a transcriptional network for naive pluripotency via active DNA demethylation. To investigate the function of TET1/TET2 in the transition form primed to naive pluripotency, we exploited microarray analysis using total mRNA derived from Scramble, Scramble + PRDM14, Tet1/Tet2 KD, Tet1/Tet2 KD + PRDM14 mouse ESCs and EpiLCs.",

Background: Histone deacetylase (HDAC) is strongly associated with epigenetic regulation and carcinogenesis, and its inhibitors induce the differentiation or apoptosis of cancer cells. Valproic acid (VPA) is one of the clinically available HDAC inhibitors. We investigated the anticancer effects of VPA in combination with gemcitabine (GEM) in cholangiocarcinoma cell line, and explored the mechanisms of the anticancer effects using microarray analysis. Methods: A human cholangiocarcinoma cell line (HuCCT1) was used. The anticancer effects of VPA, or gemcitabine (GEM), and the effects of VPA combined with GEM, were studied by cell proliferation assay. The microarray analysis was performed, the genes were picked up using Gene Spring GX11.5, Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) was performed, and then the gene-expression was determined by RT-PCR. Results: GEM (5nM) and VPA (0.5mM) reduced by 23%, which significantly augmented the anticancer effect of GEM alone or VPA alone (P<0.01). Using the microarray analysis, forty-three genes were identified with the comparison between GEM group and GEM plus VPA combination group. The interactions were shown between genes of the \"Cellular Development\" relevant to the differentiation of cancer cell using IPA. Total RNA was isolated from both the stimulated and unstimulated cells (HuCCT-1) using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Relative purity was examined using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). RNA expression was analyzed using GeneChip*R Human Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), containing 28,869 oligonucleotide probes for known and unknown genes. First standard cDNA was synthesized from 300 ng of total RNA by using GeneChip*R Whole Transcript (WT) cDNA Synthesis and Amplification Kit (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 mg of cRNA were input into the second-cycle cDNA reaction. cDNA was fragmented and end-labeled with the GeneChip*R WT Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix). Approximately 5.5mg of fragmented and labeled DNA target was hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip*R Human Gene 1.0 ST Array at 45degC for 17h on a GeneChip*R Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Hybridized arrays were washed and stained on a GeneChip*R Fluidics Station 450 and scanned on a GeneChip*R Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix), and then generated CEL files for each array. The microarray data was normalized by GeneSpring GX 11.5 software (Agilent). The cut-off value was set at 0.5 to 2.0 for the ratio (more than 2.0: up-regulation, 0.5-2.0: no change, less than 0.5: down-regulation). Gene Ontology (GO) was analyzed using GeneSpring GX 11.5 software (Agilent), and p-value < 0.05 was used for significance. Then we used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) 8.7 (http://www.ingenuity.com) to determine the functional pathways associated with the set of differentially expressed genes between genotypes.

Midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons derived from pluripotent stem cells are of substantial interest because of their instrumental value for PD therapy. IPSC-derived mDA neuron-like cells have been generated, however, detailed genetic and epigenetic characterization of strictly purified in vitro generated DA neurons has so far lagged behind. We generated mouse Pitx3gfp/+ iPSC-derived DA neurons that, after fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) allowed comprehensive comparison to mesodiencephalic dopaminergic (mdDA) neurons from Fac-sorted Pitx3gfp/+ ventral midbrains. We performed detailed analysis of global gene expression and genome-scale DNA methylation of CpG islands (CGIs) by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. The reprogramming pathway from fibroblasts to iPSCs left parental cell footprints for both gene expression and DNA methylation. However, most gene expression patterns of iPSC-derived DA neurons closely resembled that of primary mdDA neurons with the strongest correlations for mdDA specific genes. Also, for DNA methylation patterns, high similarities were found for the vast majority of CGIs when comparing primary mdDA neurons with iPSC-derived DA neurons. Additionally, we found de novo DNA methylation during in vitro differentiation for hundreds of genes specifically in lineage-committed neural precursors that persisted in iPSC-derived DA neurons. Our study provides novel detailed characteristics of iPSC-derived DA neurons in comparison to the primary cell type.

Proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFalpha can facilitate tumor progression and metastasis. However, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying TNBC progression mediated by inflammation is still limited. Here, we define the AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun cistrome, which is comprised of 13800 binding sites responsive to TNFalpha-induced signaling in TNBC cells. In addition, we show that c-Jun regulates nearly a third of the TNFalpha-elicited transcriptome. Expression of the c-Jun-regulated pro-invasion gene program is strongly associated with clinical outcomes in TNBCs. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that c-Jun drives TNFalpha-mediated TNBC tumorigenicity by transcriptional regulation of Ninj1. As exemplified by the c-Jun bound CXC chemokine genes clustered on chromosome 4, we demonstrate that NF-kB might be a pioneer factor and is required for the regulation of TNFalpha-inducible inflammatory genes, whereas c-Jun has little effect.

Histone H3.3 is a highly conserved histone H3 replacement variant in metazoans, and has been implicated in many important biological processes including cell differentiation and reprogramming. Germline and somatic mutations in H3.3 genomic incorporation pathway components, or in H3.3 encoding genes, have been associated with human congenital diseases and cancers, respectively. However, the role of H3.3 in mammalian development remains unclear. To address this question, we generated H3.3 null mouse models through classical genetic approaches. We found H3.3 plays an essential role in mouse development. Complete depletion of H3.3 leads to developmental retardation and early embryonic lethality. At the cellular level, H3.3 loss triggers cell cycle suppression and cell death. Surprisingly, H3.3 depletion does not dramatically disrupt gene regulation in the developing embryo. Instead, H3.3 depletion causes dysfunction of heterochromatin structures at telomeres, centromeres and pericentromeric regions of chromosomes leading to mitotic defects. The resulting karyotypical abnormalities and DNA damage lead to p53 pathway activation.

Previous studies showed that 5-FU modulates RNA metabolism and mRNA expression. In addition, it has been reported that 5-FU incorporates into the RNAs constituting the translational machinery and that 5-FU affects the amount of some mRNAs associated with ribosomes. However, the impact of 5-FU on translational regulation remains unclear. Using translatome profiling, we report that a clinically relevant dose of 5-FU induces a translational reprogramming in colorectal cancer cell lines. Comparison of mRNA distribution between polysomal and non-polysomal fractions in response to 5-FU treatment using microarray quantification identified 313 genes whose translation was selectively regulated. These regulations were mostly stimulatory (91%). Among these genes, we showed that 5-FU increases the mRNA translation of HIVEP2, which encodes a transcription factor whose translation in normal condition is known to be inhibited by mir-155. In response to 5-FU, the expression of mir-155 decreases thus stimulating the translation of HIVEP2 mRNA. Interestingly, the 5-FU-induced increase in specific mRNA translation was associated with reduction of global protein synthesis. Altogether, these findings indicate that 5-FU promotes a translational reprogramming leading to the increased translation of a subset of mRNAs that involves at least for some of them, miRNA-dependent mechanisms. This study supports a still poorly evaluated role of translational control in drug response. 8 total samples were analyzed.

    "text": "Aging-associated gene expression profiling in adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells. Background & Aims: Recently, energy metabolism in adipose tissue has been the subject of renewed interest, because significant energy expenditure can be induced in cells derived from white adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (Ad-MSCs) as beige adipocytes (BA), in addition to brown adipose tissue. Here we evaluated whether age-related changes in Ad-MSCs affect on impaired energy homeostasis and progressive obesity-related diseases. Materials and Methods: We isolated Ad-MSCs from subcutaneous murine fat tissues fed with control chow (C) or high-fat diet (60% fat; HF) for 12 or 24 weeks (younger or older groups, respectively). After two to three times passage, we performed the cellular characteristics analyses, which included differentiation property, flow cytometric and microarray analyses. Results: Ad-MSCs from older mice showed impaired differentiation capacity into BAs compared to the cells from younger mice. Global gene expression analysis by microarray revealed several genes involved with the browning of white adipose tissue were down-regulated according to aging. Additionally, HF feeding promoted aging-associated characteristic changes in Ad-MSCs. Conclusion: These results indicate the compensation potential of Ad-MSCs on energy homeostasis is affected by aging and dietary factors. A new approach targeting Ad-MSCs might represent a potential strategy for the prevention of obesity-related diseases. Six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were fed control chow (C) or high-fat diet (60% fat; HF) for 12 or 24 weeks. The Ad-MSC samples were collected from subcutaneous murine fat tissues, and compared global gene expression by AgilentMouse GE 8x60k Microarray.",

    "text": "IL-8 released from human pancreatic cancer and tumor associated stromal cells signals through a CXCR2-ERK1/2 axis to induce muscle atrophy. Serum levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8) are increased in the serum of people with pancreatic cancer and associated with the loss of body weight and low muscle mass. We have identified that systemic (intraperitoneal) injection of IL-8 into mice induces significant skeletal muscle atrophy. Transcriptional profiling of muscle harvested from these same mice identified the genes and biological processes associated with this IL-8 induced atrophy including gene clusters related to chromatin modification, muscle cell differentiation, and ubiquitin ligase complex.In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from the tibialis anterior muscle from vehicle-injected mice, KC-injected mice, and IL-8 injected mice. The purpose of this study was to identify the broader transcriptional networks changed in skeletal muscle in response to a systemic increase in IL-8 or KC. For microarray analysis, a total of 12 RNA samples across three groups are included. The groups are as follows: Vehicle-injected control mice (n = 3); KC-injected mice (n = 4); IL-8 injected mice (n = 5). To identify broader gene networks changed in skeletal muscle in response to systemic delivery of KC or IL-8, we performed differential expression analysis between vehicle injected controls and KC-injected mice, and between vehicle-injected controls and IL-8-injected mice.",
