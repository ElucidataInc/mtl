Systemic sclerosis is a connective tissue disease affecting skin and internal organs, characterized by a triad of inflammation, vasculopathy and progressive fibrosis, due to deposition of mainly type I collagen. Out of the intricate mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, evidence indicates that TGFbeta signaling plays a central role in mediating the effects of several pro-fibrotic effectors. In addition, TGFbeta is induced by hypoxia in cultured fibroblasts, an observation suggesting a role for this cytokine in linking vasculopathy and fibrosis in the disease. Not surprisingly, TGFbeta and Wnt signaling are among the most prevalent pathways found in global gene expression studies performed on systemic sclerosis skin biopsies. In this perspective, modulation of TGFbeta activity remains a top therapeutic target in systemic sclerosis drug development.We recently performed whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in systemic sclerosis patients, and evidenced deep connective tissue infiltrates surrounding tendons in patients with active disease, and tendon friction rubs. Tenosynovitis and arthritis were also found by MRI in one third of the patients. We performed tenosynovial biopsies in patients with clinically active tenosynovitis, in order to evaluate whether such samples would provide additional information on disease mechanisms. Here, we report that these samples are characterized by the over-expression of genes involved in fibrosis, TGFbeta/Wnt signaling, chemokines and cytokines, but also by the concurrent over-expression of several ubiquitin-specific peptidases (USPs).Among the USPs overexpressed in systemic sclerosis tenosynovial biopsies, USP15 is known to specifically deubiquitinate SMAD3, and the TGFbeta Receptor 1. These results triggered us to perform additional experiments in order to test whether USP15 overexpression plays a role in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis via decreased ubiquitin-mediated degradation of proteins involved in TGFbeta signaling. Five tenosynovial biopsies were obtained from diffuse systemic sclerosis patients undergoing surgical procedures due to refractory pain and/or loss of function caused by tenosynovitis. These samples were used in high-density transcriptomic and immunohistochemistry experiments.Samples SSc1 to SSc5 are related to this submission. 25 synovial biopsy samples harvested previously by our group in patients with several rheumatic conditions (GSE36700) were used in the normalization procedure.For samples SSc1 to SSc5 , race, age and sex are blinded to preserve patients' confidentiality.",

Genes associated with naive pluripotency are transiently repressed in the transition from inner cell mass (ICM) to epiblast cells, followed by their upregulation soon after PGC specification. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the reactivation of pluripotency genes are poorly characterized. Here, we exploited in vitro differentiation of epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to elucidate the molecular and epigenetic functions of PR domain-containing 14 (PRDM14). We found that Prdm14 overexpression in EpiLCs induced their conversion to ESC-like cells even in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). This was impaired by the loss of Kruppel-like factor 2 (Klf2) and ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins. Furthermore, PRDM14 recruited OCT3/4 to the enhancer regions of naive pluripotency genes via TET-base excision-repair-mediated demethylation. Our results provide evidence that PRDM14 establishes a transcriptional network for naive pluripotency via active DNA demethylation. To investigate the function of TET1/TET2 in the transition form primed to naive pluripotency, we exploited microarray analysis using total mRNA derived from Scramble, Scramble + PRDM14, Tet1/Tet2 KD, Tet1/Tet2 KD + PRDM14 mouse ESCs and EpiLCs.",

Craniosynostosis (CS) is the congenital premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures and represents the more prevalent craniofacial malformation in humans, with an overall incidence of 1 out of 2000-3000 live births. Non-syndromic craniosynostoses (NSC) are believed to be multifactorial disorders, with a strong genetic component, due to possible gene-gene or gene-environment interactions that remain to be clearly identified. In this study we delved into the molecular signaling acting in calvarial tissue and cells from patients affected by nonsynodromic midline craniosynostosis, using a comparative analysis between fused and unfused sutures of each affected individuals. Using comparative microarray tissue gene expression profiling we have identified a subset of genes involved in the structure and function of the primary cilium, including the Bardet-Biedl syndrome 9 (BBS9) gene, which was recently associated to sagittal synostosis in a GWAS study. We therefore characterized BBS9 expression and cilium-related signaling in cells isolated from patients' calvarial bone. 5 patients affected by nonsynodromic sagittal synostosis or nonsyndromic metopic synostosis were enrolled in this study. Tissue specimens were collected, from each patients, both from patent and fused calvarial sutures and cryopreservated in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from snap-frozen calvarial tissue specimens using pestel and TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), and subsequently purified using silica membrane spin columns from RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). The yield, quality and integrity of RNA were determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). The resulting total RNA was then used to created the biotin-labeled library to be hybridized on GeneChip(r) Exon 1.0 ST human microarrays following the procedure described by the manufacturer (Affymetrix). The CEL files resulting from the hybridization were analyzed using oneChannelGUI 1.6.5 (Sanges et al. Bioinformatics 2007, 23, 3406-3408). Exon and gene-level probeset summarization was done by mean of RMA and sketch quantile normalization. Gene-level differential expression: to assess differential expression at gene-level, we used an empirical Bayes method together with a false discovery rate (FDR) correction of the p-value Thus, the list of differentially expressed genes was generated using an FDR <= 0.05 together with an absolute log2(fold-change) threshold of 1. Exon-level analysis: an intensity filter was subsequently applied at gene-level to remove not expressed and low expressed genes, i.e. genes were retained for exon-level analysis if in all biological replication gene-level signal was greater than 5. Subsequently, only genes characterized to have at least two RNA isoforms annotated in Ensembl database were retained for further analysis. The Splicing Index value was calculated by taking the log2 ratio of the normalized exon intensity (NI) in Sample 1 and the NI in Sample 2. The normalized exon intensity (NI) is the ratio of the probe set intensity to the gene intensity. Alternative splicing events (ASEs) were detected as described in (Della Beffa et al. BMC Genomics 2008, 9, 571).",

The functions of key oncogenic transcription factors independent of context have not been fully delineated despite our richer understanding of the genetic alterations in human cancers. The MYC oncogene, which produces the Myc transcription factor, is frequently altered in human cancer and is a major regulatory hub for many cancers. In this regard, we sought to unravel the primordial signature of Myc function by using high-throughput genomic approaches to identify the cell-type independent core Myc target gene signature. Using a model of human B lymphoma cells bearing inducible MYC, we identified a stringent set of direct Myc target genes via chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), global nuclear run-on assay, and changes in mRNA levels. We also identified direct Myc targets in human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We further document that a Myc core signature (MCS) set of target genes is shared in mouse and human ESCs as well as in four other human cancer cell types. Remarkably, the expression of the MCS correlates with MYC expression in a cell-type independent manner across 8,129 microarray samples, which include 312 cell and tissue types. Furthermore, the expression of the MCS is elevated in vivo in Em-Myc transgenic murine lymphoma cells as compared with premalignant or normal B lymphocytes. Expression of the MCS in human B cell lymphomas, acute leukemia, lung cancers or Ewing sarcomas has the highest correlation with MYC expression. Annotation of this gene signature reveals Myc's primordial function in RNA processing, ribosome biogenesis and biomass accumulation as its key roles in cancer and stem cells.This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

Analysis of cancer epigenomes has revealed important insights into key lineage determinants and oncogenic drivers. Chromatin immune-precipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) has allowed the comprehensive mapping of transcription factor cistromes and histone modifications in fresh or frozen cells and tissues. It has not been possible, however, to apply ChIP-seq to the vast majority of clinical tissue samples, owing to the very extensive tissue fixation and cross-linking introduced during routine pathological processing. This severely limits the ability to study the most valuable, clinically annotated tissue resources. Here we describe Fixed-Tissue chromatin immune-precipitation sequencing (FiT-seq), which allows the epigenomic analysis of routine formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples. FiT-seq enables reliable extraction of soluble chromatin from fixed tissues for accurate detection of histone marks and we verify high concordance between FiT-seq from FFPE and ChIP-seq from matched fresh frozen (FF) samples of the same tumors. We demonstrate the value of FiT-seq to investigate differences in chromatin states in normal and malignant colorectal epithelium and to identify robust correlations to methylated DNA, gene expression, and transcription factor activities. Using multiple histone marks we generate chromatin state maps and identify tissue- and tumor-specific cis-regulatory elements in clinical samples from various tumor types, readily distinguishing cancers by tissue of origin. Tumor specific enhancers and super-enhancers elucidated by FiT-seq are correlated with known biological drivers of cancer and can assist in understanding how chromatin state affects gene regulation. Histone marks analysis in FFPE samples to assess the performance of our newly designed method FiT-seq. The design comprises: 1) analysis of H3K4me2 in colorectal (CRC) FFPE vs matched FF tissues. 2) H3K4me2 comparison between CRC and corresponding colonic mucosas both for FF and FFPE samples. 3) analysis of enhancers by H3K4me2 across tumor types (CRC, breast cancer, seminoma, bladder cancer) in FFPE samples. 4) analysis of a series of histone marks that includes H3K36me3, H3K4me3, H3K4me2, H3K9ac, H3K27me3 in a FFPE bladder cancer (BlCa6) and includes H3K36me3, H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 in a FFPE (CRC8).",

Vestibular schwannoma (VS) growth cause progressive hearing loss, and the standard treatment including surgery and radiotherapy, can further damage the nerve. There is an urgent need to identify an adjunct therapy that, by enhancing the efficacy of radiation, can help lower the radiation dose and preserve hearing. The mechanisms underlying deafness in NF2 are still unclear. One of the major limitations in studying tumor-induced hearing loss is the lack of mouse models that allows hearing test. Here we developed a cerebellopontine angle (CPA) schwannomas model that faithfully recapitulates the tumor-induced hearing loss. Using this model we discovered that cMET blockade by crizotinib (CRZ) enhanced schwannoma radiosensitivity by enhancing DNA damage, and CRZ treatment combined with low-dose radiation was as effective as high-dose radiation. CRZ treatment had no adverse effect on hearing; however, it did not affect tumor-induced hearing loss, presumably because cMET blockade did not change tumor HGF levels. cMET gene knockdown study independently confirmed the role of cMET pathway in mediating the effect of CRZ. Furthermore, we evaluated the translational potential of cMET blockade in human schwannomas. We found that human NF2-associated and sporadic VSs showed significantly elevated HGF expression and cMET activation compared to normal nerves, which correlated with tumor growth and cyst formation. Using organoid brain slice culture, cMET blockade inhibited the growth of patient-derived schwannomas. Our findings provide the rationale and necessary data for the clinical translation of combined cMET blockade with radiation therapy in NF2 patients.We found that human NF2-associated and sporadic VSs showed significantly elevated HGF expression and cMET activation compared to normal nerves, which correlated with tumor growth and cyst formation.

The nerve growth factor NGF has been shown to cause cell fate decisions towards either differentiation or proliferation depending on the relative activity of downstream pERK, pAKT or pJNK signaling. However, how these protein signals are translated into and fed back from transcriptional activity to complete cellular differentiation over a time span of hours to days is still an open question. Using dynamic proteome and transcriptome data from NGF-stimulated PC12 cells over a time span of 24 hours we inferred a dynamic Boolean model capturing the temporal sequence of protein signaling, transcriptional response and subsequent autocrine feedback. Optimal model topology was achieved by introducing multiple time scales for fast cellular signaling and slower gene response and subsequent fitting to the experimental data. The integrated model confirmed the parallel use of MEK/ERK, AKT/PI3K and JNK/JUN for PC12 cell differentiation. Redundancy of cell signaling is demonstrated from the inhibition of the different MAPK pathways. As suggested in silico and confirmed in vitro, differentiation was substantially suppressed under JNK/JUN inhibition, yet delayed only under MEK/ERK inhibition. Most importantly, we found that sustained transcriptional feedback is necessary to induce bistability in the cell fate switch. De novo Gene expression was necessary to activate autocrine feedback that caused integrin signaling to perpetuate the MAPK activity, finally resulting in the expression of late, differentiation related genes. Thus, the cellular decision towards differentiation depends on the establishment of a transcriptome-induced positive feedback between protein signaling and gene expression thereby constituting a robust control between proliferation and differentiation. To eludicate the transcriptome response of PC12 cells time-resolved gene expression data of NGF or EGF simulated PC12 were recorded at t = [0.5h 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 5h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 48h] for NGF and at t=[1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 24h].

One third of all human MB exhibits a gene expression signature of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. Hedgehog (Hh) pathway inhibitors have shown efficacy in clinical trials for MB, however, tumors develop resistance to these compounds, highlighting the need to identify additional therapeutic targets for treatment. We have identified a role for Norrin signaling in tumor initiation in the Patched (Ptch) mouse model of MB. Norrin is a secreted factor that functions as an atypical Wnt by binding to the Frizzled4 (Fzd4) receptor on endothelial cells to activate canonical beta-catenin-mediated Wnt signaling pathway. In the cerebellum, activation of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling is required for the establishment and maintenance of the blood brain barrier (BBB). We have identified a role for Norrin signaling in the stroma as a potent tumor inhibitory signal. Inactivation of Norrin in Ptch+/- mice significantly shortens latency and increases MB incidence. This phenotype is associated with an increased frequency of pre-tumor lesions and their conversion to malignancy. In this context, loss of Norrin signalling in endothelial cells is associated with an accelerated transition to a pro-tumor stroma characterized by vascular permeability, inflammation and angiogenic remodelling. Accordingly, loss of Ndp significantly alters the stromal gene expression signature of established Ptch MB. Ptch+/- mice were maintained on a C57Bl/6 background. NdpKO mice, generated by disruption of the Ndp locus by a lacZ-containing cassette were obtained from Lexicon Pharmaceuticals (Junge et al., 2009) and maintained by interbreeding on a mixed background. Ndp is an X-linked gene and Ndp+/- females were crossed with Ptch+/- males, to generate male (Ndp-/y;Ptch+/-) NdpKO;Ptch+/- compound mutants. All compound mutants were compared to single Ptch+/- or wild-type controls from the same breeding cohort to ensure matched backgrounds. Granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) were isolated from postnatal day 6 (P6) cerebella of WT, Ptch+/- and Ndp-/y;Ptch+/- mice. MB tumors were dissected from the cerebella of symptomatic Ptch and Ndp-/y;Ptch+/- mice. To identify an NDP-dependent gene signature in tumors we compare gene expression in GNPs and MB from mice of the indicated genotypes.",

CBC effects are particular for individual RNA families, but how such selectivity is achieved remains elusive. Here, we analyze three main CBC partners known to impact different RNA species. ARS2 stimulates 3'-end formation/transcription termination of several transcript types, ZC3H18 stimulates degradation of a diverse set of RNAs, and PHAX functions in pre-small nuclear RNA/small nucleolar RNA (pre-snRNA/snoRNA) transport. Surprisingly, these proteins all bind capped RNAs without strong preferences for given transcripts, and their steady-state binding correlates poorly with their function. Despite this, PHAX and ZC3H18 compete for CBC binding and we demonstrate that this competitive binding is functionally relevant. We further show that CBC-containing complexes are short lived in vivo, and we therefore suggest that RNA fate involves the transient formation of mutually exclusive CBC complexes, which may only be consequential at particular checkpoints during RNA biogenesis. RNA profiles of HeLa cells treated with PHAX, ZC3H18 and control siRNAs were generated by paired-end sequencing, in triplicated samples.iCLIP experiments were carried out on the CBP20, ARS2, PHAX, and ZC3H18 proteins in HeLa and HEK293 cells.

    "text": "Epithelial membrane protein 2 (EMP2) deficiency alters placental angiogenesis mimicking features of human intrauterine growth restriction. Epithelial membrane protein-2 (EMP2) is a tetraspan protein predicted to regulateplacental development. Highly expressed in secretory endometrium and trophectoderm cells, previous studies suggest that it may regulate implantation by orchestrating the surface expression of integrins and other membrane proteins. In order to confirm the role of EMP2 in pregnancy, mice lacking EMP2 (Emp2-/- ) were generated. These animals are fertile but have reduced litter sizes. Moreover, their placentas exhibit dysregulation in pathways related to neoangiogenesis, coagulation, and oxidative stress, and have increased fibrin deposition and altered vasculature. Given that these findings often occur due to placental insufficiency resulting in an oxygen-poor environment, expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1a) was examined. Emp2-/- animals have reduced HIF-1a expression within cells of trophoblast origin. However, they appear to have a compensatory increase in uterine NK (uNK) cells, demonstrating a unique interplay between uNK cells and trophoblasts modulated through EMP2. To determine if these results translated to human pregnancy, placentas from normal, term deliveries or those complicated by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) were stained for EMP2. EMP2 was significantly reduced in both villous and extravillous trophoblast populations in IUGR placentas. Experiments in vitro using human trophoblast cells lines indicate that EMP2 modulates angiogenesis by altering HIF-1a expression. Our results reveal a novel role for EMP2 in regulating trophoblast function and vascular development in conditions of altered oxygen availability in mice and humans and suggest it may be a novel biomarker for placental insufficiency. Day 13.5 placental tissue was isolated from Emp2+/+ and Emp2-/- animals and snap-frozen. Total RNA from each tissue was extracted using theRNAeasy kit (Qiagen. 3 samples per group were subjected to Illumina sequencing using the UCLA Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Core.

Aberrant DNA methylation (5mC) is one of the key characteristics of many cancers including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) has anti-cancer therapeutic potential, but its clinical efficacy is currently hindered by dose-limiting side effects. Here we investigated the potential use of DAC in the treatment of HNSCC and show that its efficacy is primarily dependent on the ability of DAC to demethylate DNA. In order to establish whether HNSCC cells can be sensitized to DAC, a panel of 100 generic drugs were screened in combination with DAC. While the 100-drug panel did not sensitise DAC-resistant HNSCC cell lines to DAC treatment, the screen identified that paracetamol (acetaminophen), valproic acid and zinc acetate significantly enhanced DAC efficacy in the DAC-responsive cell lines. DAC and paracetamol were established to work in synergy, allowing DAC to be used at therapeutically relevant low doses (below 500nM). The mechanisms underlying the DAC-paracetamol synergy are multifactorial and encompass both effects of DAC on paracetamol action (alterations in the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway and mimicry of paracetamol overdose) as well as decreased DNA methylation by paracetamol. Therefore, we propose DAC to be a potential therapeutic in a subset of HNSCC patients with its efficacy significantly increased by use of the common analgesic paracetamol. The DAC-paracetamol synergy should also be considered in cancers with an approved DAC treatment regime. There are four RNA-seq samples. VU40T squamous cell cacrcinoma cells were treated for 96h with 500nM 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC), 132.3mM Paracetamol (Para), or both and compared to the untreated cells (control).

ETS transcription factors ETV2, FLI1 and ERG1 specify pluripotent stem cells into endothelial cells (PSC-ECs). However, these PSC-ECs are unstable and often drift towards non-vascular cell fates. We show that human mid-gestation c-Kit- lineage-committed amniotic cells (ACs) can be reprogrammed into induced vascular endothelial cells (rAC-VECs). Transient ETV2 expression in ACs generated immature iVECs, while co-expression with FLI1/ERG1 endowed rAC-VECs with a vascular repertoire and morphology matching mature ECs. Brief TGFb-inhibition functionalizes VEGFR2 signaling, augmenting specification of ACs into rAC-VECs. Genome-wide transcriptional analyses showed that rAC-VECs are similar to adult ECs in which vascular-specific genes are expressed and non-vascular genes are silenced. Functionally, rAC-VECs form stable vasculature in Matrigel plugs and regenerating livers. Thus, short-term ETV2 expression and TGFb-inhibition along with constitutive ERG1/FLI1 co-expression reprogram mature ACs into generic rAC-VECs with clinical-scale expansion potential.

    "text": "Imprinted expression is different in visceral yolk sac and cystic embryoid body endoderm. Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon resulting in parent-of-origin mono-allelic expression of a small subset of mammalian genes. Imprinted genes have been categorized into two groups: multi lineage (ML) imprinted genes that can show imprinted expression in both embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages, and genes that show extra-embryonic lineage (EXEL) specific imprinted expression restricted to tissues like the placenta and visceral yolk sac (VYS) endoderm. Many genes showing EXEL imprinted expression are silenced by lncRNAs that act over long distances. Thus the analysis of this form of gene silencing is likely to be pivotal for understanding new mechanisms of long range gene silencing by lncRNAs. It has been reported that ES cells differentiated into cystic embryoid bodies (cystic EBs) contain VYS endoderm and here we investigate if cystic EBs could serve as an in vitro model for the analysis of EXEL imprinted expression. Unexpectedly we found that cystic EBs lack EXEL imprinted expression, while retaining normal imprinted expression of ML genes. This shows that cystic EBs do not model VYS imprinted expression and also argues against previous claims that cystic EBs contain VYS endoderm. We further characterized cystic EBs by performing RNA-seq and whole genome bisulphite sequencing. By comparison to various embryonic tissues we found that cystic EBs more resemble embryonic liver, which contains definitive endoderm, than the extra-embryonic endoderm of the VYS.

Employing a genome-wide gene expression study, we identified transcription regulators whose expression correlates highly with that of differentiation markers both in bladder and skin, including the Grainyhead factor Get1/Grhl3, already known to be important for epidermal barrier formation. In the bladder, Get1 is most highly expressed in the differentiated umbrella cells and its mutation in mice leads to a defective bladder epithelial barrier formation due to failure of apical membrane specialization. Genes encoding components of the specialized urothelial membrane, the uroplakins, were downregulated in Get1-/- mice. At least one of these genes, Uroplakin II, is a direct target of Get1. The urothelial-specific activation of the Uroplakin II gene is due to selective binding of Get1 to the Uroplakin II promoter in urothelial cells, most likely regulated by histone modifications. These results demonstrate a key role for Get1 in urothelial differentiation and barrier formation. .

NMD is a RNA quality control mechanism, which detects and degrades aberrant mRNAs as well as some normal transcripts including those that harbor upstream open reading frames in their 5' leader sequence and long 3' UTR. In this study, we used RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to perform a genome wide analysis of the effect of either eRF3 or Upf1 depletion in human cells. Our bioinformatics analyses allow to delineate the features of the transcripts controlled by eRF3 and Upf1 and to compare the effect of each of these factors on gene expression. We show that eRF3 and Upf1 have very different impact on the human transcriptome, only ~250 transcripts being targeted by both factors.

This study aimed at the molecular characterization of PC derived from MM patients who achieved CR after bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone (VTD) first line therapy.One hundred and eighteen MM primary tumours obtained from homogeneously treated patients were globally profiled both for gene expression and for single nucleotide polymorphism genotype. Genomic results were used to obtain a predictor of sensitivity to VTD induction therapy, as well as to describe both the transcription and the genomic profile of PC derived from patients with MM who will respond optimally to primary induction therapy.By analysing the gene profiles of CR patients, we identified a 5-gene signature predicting CR with an overall median accuracy of 75% (range: 72%-85%). In addition, we highlighted the differential expression of a series of genes, whose deregulation, accordingly to their reported functions, might explain the CR patients' sensitivity to VTD therapy.

Both IL-12 and IFN-a have been shown to act as the third signal regulating the development of CTLs. We have shown that these two cytokines have a non-redundant effect in generation of human effector CTL. IL-12 alone is sufficient for effector CTL genesis marked by IFN-g and TNF-a production, as well as increased cytolytic activity. Even in the presence of IFN-a, IL-12 programs CTLs that express the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and effector cytokines. Using microarray analysis we have investigated how IL-12 and IFN-a differentially regulate the genetic programming pathways that give rise to effector CTLs among multiple human donors. We have also analyzed the gene expression patterns of cells sorted from healthy human peripheral blood that display surface markers of effector memory CTL (designated as ex vivo) samples. 5 healthy human donor samples were used for the in vitro cultures. For each donor the CFSE labeled cells (CD8+CD45RA+) were cultured in the presence of neutralized, IL-12, IFN-a, and IL-12+IFN-a conditions and plate-bound anti-CD3+anti-CD28 for 3.5 days. Total RNA from CFSEhi (Undiv) and CFSElo (Div) sorted cells were used for Illumina Bead Array. 4 healthy human donor samples were used for the ex vivo samples. Total RNA was collected from FACS sorted CD8+CCR7hiCXCR3lo and CD8+CCR7loCXCR3hi cells without any stimulation.",

    "text": "Gene expression analysis of renal cell carcinoma cell line A-498 after 20-hour treatment with englerin A. Natural products possess enormous structural and chemical diversity and are a rich source of drugs or drug-like leads. Although the final products may not necessarily represent the active ingredients of the natural source, the majority of all drugs in the market have their origin in nature. Englerin A is guaiane sesquiterpene that was isolated from the Tanzanian plant Phyllanthus engleri and has attracted much attention because of its unique structure and cytotoxicity profile in cancer cells. Englerin A was documented to have potent cytotoxicity preferentially against renal cancer cells when tested against the NCI60 cell panel. Very recently, however, a study which screened englerin A against 524 cancer cell lines from the cancer cell line encyclopedia reported that englerin A was also cytotoxic to a small subset of cancer cells in addition to renal cancer cells.[19]. In addition to its unique structure and cytotoxicity profile, englerin A is distinctive because it can cause cell death by multiple death mechanisms including necrosis and apoptosis, with apoptosis occurring in the absence of caspase activation. The distinctive features of englerin A suggest that it has a unique mechanism of action and recent reports, though lacking consensus, support this notion. Englerin A has been shown to activate protein kinase C theta (PKCth) and was proposed to affect cell viability by promoting glucose dependence while simultaneously starving cells of glucose. Englerin A has also been shown to increase cytosolic calcium levels which may play a role in the decreased phosphorylation and activity of the oncoprotein, EWS-FLI1, in Ewing's sarcoma. Two other groups have reported that englerin A inhibits tumor cell growth by activating the transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily C, member 4 (TRPC4) ion channel, while a third group reported that englerin A antagonized L-type calcium channels. However, in at least two of these studies, the concentration of englerin A that was required to modulate these calcium channels was much higher than that required to kill renal carcinoma cells and other cells sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of englerin A. For instance, the most recent study reported that englerin A displaced a radiolabeled tool compound bound to an L-type calcium channel in a concentration-dependent manner with a Ki of 5.7 M. In contrast, the EC50 of englerin A in reducing the viability or growth of most renal cancer cell lines in the NCI60 cell panel is less than 60 nM, suggesting that modulation of L-type or TRPC calcium channels is not required for englerin A to induce toxic effects in these cells. It is still not clear what mechanisms account for the cytotoxicity of englerin A at nanomolar levels in these cells. We anticipate that there may be other mechanisms and targets of englerin A as natural products generally have multiple targets. In the current study, we chose microarray as well as other technologies to explore the mechanism(s) of action of englerin A at a more global level. Gene expression analysis was performed on A-498 cells treated with 100 nM englerin A during 20 hours. Four replicates of vehicle control and englerin A treated A-498 cells were used in the experiment.",

Extensive cellular heterogeneity exists within specific immune-cell subtypes classified as a single lineage, but its molecular underpinnings are rarely characterized at a genomic scale. Here, we use single-cell RNA-seq to investigate the molecular mechanisms governing heterogeneity and pathogenicity of Th17 cells isolated from the central nervous system (CNS) and lymph nodes (LN) at the peak of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) or polarized in vitro under either pathogenic or non-pathogenic differentiation conditions. Computational analysis reveals a spectrum of cellular states in vivo, including a self-renewal state, Th1-like effector/memory states and a dysfunctional/senescent state. Relating these states to in vitro differentiated Th17 cells, unveils genes governing pathogenicity and disease susceptibility. Using knockout mice, we validate four novel genes: Gpr65, Plzp, Toso and Cd5l (in a companion paper). Cellular heterogeneity thus informs Th17 function in autoimmunity, and can identify targets for selective suppression of pathogenic Th17 cells while sparing non-pathogenic tissue-protective ones.

Axl expression is deregulated in several cancer types, predicts poor overall patient survival and is linked to increase in resistance to drug therapy. Here, we have evaluated a library of natural compounds for inhibitors of Axl. We identified dihydroartemisin (DHA), the active principle of the anti-malarial drug artemisinin, as a specific Axl inhibitor in prostate cancer (PCa). DHA blocks Axl expression leading to apoptosis induction, decrease in cell proliferation, migration and tumor development of PCa cells. Furthermore, DHA treatment synergizes with docetaxel, a standard of care in metastatic PCa, and increases the overall survival of mice with human PCa xenografts. We demonstrated that DHA-mediated control of miR-34a and miR-7 expression leads to inhibition of Axl expression. This process is dependent on regulation of the chromatin via methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 residues (H3K27) by Jumonji, AT-rich interaction domain containing 2 (JARID2) and the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), components of the Polycomb Complex Repressor 2 (PCR2). Our discovery of a previously unidentified miR-34a/miR-7/JARID2 pathway that controls DHA-mediated effects on Axl expression and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor formation provides new molecular and mechanistic insights into DHA's anti-cancer effect on PCa with potential therapeutic implications.

Steroid hormone receptors are simultaneously active in many tissues and capable of altering each other's function.

In endometrial tumors expressing high levels of ER, we surprisingly found that expression of GR is associated with poor prognosis. Dexamethasone reduced normal uterine growth in vivo; however, this growth inhibition was abolished in estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia. We observed low genomic binding site overlap when ER and GR are induced with their respective ligands; however, upon simultaneous induction they co-occupy more sites. GR binding is significantly altered by estradiol with GR recruited to ER bound loci that become more accessible upon estradiol induction. Gene expression responses to co-treatment were more similar to estradiol, but with novel regulated genes.

Neuroblastoma is a pediatric tumor of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system with a highly variable prognosis. Activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in neuroblastoma is correlated with poor patient prognosis, but the precise downstream effectors mediating this effect have not been determined. Here, we identify the forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a as a key target of the PI3K/AKT pathway in neuroblastoma. FOXO3a expression was elevated in low stage neuroblastoma tumors and normal embryonal neuroblasts, but reduced in late stage neuroblastoma. Inactivation of FOXO3a by AKT was essential for neuroblastoma cell survival. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103 activated FOXO3a and triggered apoptosis. This effect was rescued by FOXO3a silencing. Conversely, apoptosis induced by PI-103 or the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 was potentiated by FOXO3a overexpression. Further, levels of total or phosphorylated FOXO3a correlated closely with apoptotic sensitivity to MK-2206. In clinical specimens, there was an inverse relationship between gene expression signatures regulated by PI3K signaling and FOXO3a transcriptional activity. Moreover, high PI3K activity and low FOXO3a activity were each associated with an extremely poor prognosis.

Innate immune system is essential for the immune surveillance of inner and outer threats, initial host defense responses and immune modulation. The role of natural drug compounds, including E. fischeriana, in innate immune regulation is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that E. fischeriana compound Dpo is involved in antiviral signaling. The genome wide RNA-seq analysis revealed that Dpo synergized the induction of ISGs by viral infection. Consistently, Dpo enhanced the antiviral immune responses and protected the mice from death during viral infection. Dpo however was not able to rescue STING deficient mice lethality caused by HSV-1 infection. The enhancement of ISG15 by Dpo was also impaired in STING, IRF3, IRF7 or ELF4 deficient cells, demonstrating that Dpo activates innate immune responses in a STING/IRFs/ELF4 dependent way. The STING/IRFs/ELF4 axis is therefore important for Dpo induced ISGs expression, and can be used by host to counteract infection. immortallized bone marrow derived macrophages were treated with medium (control) or Dpo at a concentration of 8ng/ul for 12 hours (Dpo)before harvest for RNA extraction.",

Using microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT) into the mouse melanoma cell line, B16F10, we have previously found that human chromosome 5 carries a gene, or genes, that can negatively regulate TERT expression. To identify the gene responsible for the regulation of TERT transcription, we performed cDNA microarray analysis using parental B16F10 cells, telomerase negative B16F10 microcell hybrids with a human chromosome 5 (B16F10MH5), and its revertant clones (MH5R) with reactivated telomerase. Here we report the identification of PITX1, whose restoration leads to the downregulation of mouse tert (mtert) transcription, as a TERT suppressor gene. Additionally, both human TERT (hTERT) and mouse TERT (mtert) promoter activity can be suppressed by PITX1. We showed that three and one binding sites, respectively, within the hTERT and mtert promoters that express a unique conserved region are responsible for the transcriptional activation of TERT. Furthermore, we showed that PITX1 binds to the TERT promoter both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, PITX1 suppresses TERT transcription through direct binding to the TERT promoter, which ultimately regulates telomerase activity. We transferred intact human chromosome 5 into mouse melanoma B16F10 cells by microcell fusion. The microcell hybrids (MH5) exhibited suppression of telomerase, we also obtained revertant clones (MH5R) in which telomerase is reactivated.

Osteocytes, positioned within bone's interstitial space, are subject to fluid flow upon whole bone loading. Such fluid flow is widely theorized to be a mechanical signal transduced by osteocytes, initiating a poorly understood cascade of signaling events mediating bone metabolism. The objective of this study was to utilize high-throughput approaches to examine the time course of flow-induced changes in osteocyte gene transcript and protein levels.Microarray analysis demonstrated fluid flow regulation of genes consistent with known anabolic loading responses, including Ptgs2, NF-kB inhibitors, MAP3 kinases, and Wnt/b-catenin pathway signaling molecules. However, two of the most highly up-regulated gene products--Cxcl1 and Cxcl2, confirmed by qPCR--have not previously been reported to be responsive to fluid flow. Gene ontology analysis suggested a highly significant inflammatory and immune response, with cellular functions including trafficking, cell-to-cell signaling, and tissue development. Proteomic analysis of the same samples demonstrated greatest up-regulation of the ATP-producing enzyme NDK, calcium-binding Calcyclin, and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 6. An integrative pathway analysis merging fold changes in transcript and protein levels predicted signaling nodes not directly detected at the sampled time points, including STAT3 and c-Myc. These results extend our knowledge of the osteocytic response to fluid flow, most notably up-regulation of Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 as a possible paracrine agent for osteoblastic and osteoclastic recruitment.

Moreover, gene array analyses of CD21-/lo B cells revealed molecules specifically expressed in these B cells and that are likely to induce their unresponsive stage. Thus, CD21-/lo B cells contain mostly autoreactive unresponsive clones, which express a specific set of molecules that may represent new biomarkers to identify anergic B cells in humans. RNA was extracted from batch sorted CD19+CD21+CD10-CD27- and CD19+CD21-CD10-CD27- naive B cells isolated from donors using the Absolutely RNA microprep kit (Stratagene). 100-200 ng of RNA was obtained per sample, and the quality of the purified RNA was assessed by the Bioanalyzer from Agilent. Using the Ovation biotin system kit from Nugen, 30-50ng of RNA was amplified and labeled to produce cDNA. Labeled cDNA was hybridized on chips containing the whole human genome (Human Genome U133 2.0 from Affymetrix). Data from CD21+ and CD21- B cell populations were compared in order to determine the gene signature of the newly described CD21- B cells.",

Intestinal T cells and Innate Lymphoid cells (ILCs) control the composition of the microbiota and respond to its perturbations. Interleukin 22 (IL-22) plays a pivotal role in the immune control of gut commensal and pathogenic bacteria and is secreted by a heterogeneous population of intestinal T cells, NCR- ILC3 and NCR+ILC3. Expression of NCR by ILC3 is believed to define an irreversible effector ILC3 end-state fate in which these cells are key to control of bacterial infection via their production of IL-22. Here we identify the core transcriptional signature that drives the differentiation of NCR- ILC3 into NCR+ ILC3 and reveal that NCR+ILC3 exhibit more plasticity than originally thought, as NCR+ ILC3 can revert to NCR- ILC3. Contrary to the prevailing understanding of NCR+ ILC3 genesis and function, in vivo analyses of mice conditionally deleted of the key ILC3 genes Stat3, Il22, Tbet and Mcl1 demonstrated that NCR+ ILC3 were not essential for the control of colonic infections in the presence of T cells. However, NCR+ ILC3 were mandatory for homeostasis of the caecum. Our data identify that the interplay of intestinal T cells and ILC3 results in robust complementary fail-safe mechanisms that ensure gut homeostasis.

T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are a subset of CD4+ T cells that promote antibody production during vaccination. Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) efficiently prime Tfh cells; however, conclusions regarding the nature of the cDC responsible for instructing Tfh cell differentiation have differed between recent studies. We found that these discrepancies might exist, in part, due to the unusual sites used for immunization in murine models, which differentially bias which DC subsets access antigen. We used intranasal immunization as a physiologically relevant route of exposure that we show delivers antigen to all tissue DC subsets. Using a combination of mice in which the function of individual DC subsets is impaired and different formulations of antigen delivery, we determined that CD11b+ migratory type 2 conventional DCs (cDC2s) are necessary and sufficient for Tfh induction. DC-specific deletion of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor DOCK8 resulted in an isolated loss of CD11b+ cDC2 but not CD103+ cDC1 migration to lung-draining lymph nodes. Impaired cDC2 migration or development in DC-specific Dock8 or Irf4 knockout mice, respectively, led to reduced Tfh cell and antibody development, whereas loss of CD103+ cDC1s in Batf3-/- mice did not. Loss of cDC2-mediated Tfh responses was associated with impaired antibody-mediated protection from live influenza virus challenge. We show that migratory cDC2s uniquely carry antigen into the sub-anatomic regions of the lymph node where Tfh cell priming occurs, the T-B border. This work identifies the DC responsible for Tfh cell-dependent antibody responses, in particular when antigen dose is limiting or is encountered at a mucosal site, which could ultimately inform the formulation and delivery of vaccines.

Development of DNA-binding domain (DBD)-HDAC inhibitors and DBD-HAT activators, which result in increased histone acetylation, has become one promising research field. However, there is no report regarding the gene regulatory pattern by sequence-specific epigenetic repressor. We report here for the first time, the synthesis of DBD-HAT inhibitors and demonstrate that these conjugates could retain their dual-target activity using predicted working model of thermal stability assay and in vitro HAT activity assay. Evaluation of antiproliferative activity in cancer cells showed that 2 (with a medium linker length of 13-atom) exhibited the highest antiproliferative activity in p53 wild-type cancer cell lines (IC50 of 1.8-2.6 uM in A549 and MV4-11 cells) and not in p53 mutant cancer cell lines. A mechanistic investigation using microarray analysis and an apoptotic assay showed that the antiproliferative effect of 2 occurred via the up-regulation of p53 target genes, and the subsequent initiation of p53-dependent apoptosis. Our research on sequence-specific dual-target epigenetic repressor offers us an alternative way to modulate HAT-governed therapeutically important genes and contributes to offer a fresh insight into antitumor therapeutics.

The use of integrated approaches in genetic toxicology, including the incorporation of gene expression data to determine the molecular pathways involved in the response, is becoming more common. In a companion paper, a genomic biomarker was developed in human TK6 cells to classify chemicals as genotoxic or non-genotoxic. Because TK6 cells are not metabolically competent, we set out to broaden the utility of the biomarker for use with chemicals requiring metabolic activation. Specifically, chemical exposures were conducted in the presence of rat liver S9. The ability of the biomarker to classify genotoxic (benzo[a]pyrene, BaP; aflatoxin B1, AFB1) and non-genotoxic (dexamethasone, DEX; phenobarbital, PB) agents correctly was evaluated. Cells were exposed to increasing chemical concentrations for 4h and collected 0h, 4h and 20h post-exposure. Relative survival, apoptosis, and micronucleus frequency were measured at 24h. Transcriptome profiles were measured with Agilent microarrays. Statistical modeling and bioinformatics tools were applied to classify each chemical using the genomic biomarker. BaP and AFB1 were correctly classified as genotoxic at the mid- and high concentrations at all three time points, whereas DEX was correctly classified as non-genotoxic at all concentrations and time points. The high concentration of PB was misclassified at 24h, suggesting that cytotoxicity at later time points may cause misclassification. The data suggest that the use of S9 does not impair the ability of the biomarker to classify genotoxicity in TK6 cells. Finally, we demonstrate that the biomarker is also able to accurately classify genotoxicity using a publicly available dataset derived from human HepaRG cells. This experiment examined the whole genome transcriptional response of TK6 cells exposed to BaP for 4 hours followed by a 4h in fresh media (8h time point) at 3 different concentrations, including a low (0.45 mg/ml), a medium (1.4 mg/ml), and a high (10 mg/ml) concentration, in addition to negative controls (+-S9), vehicle controls (+-S9) and a direct-acting positive control, cisplatin (-S9) at 24 mg/ml (PC-24). Each concentration and time point had 3 biological replicates.

While immune responses during nervous system injury and disease are well studied, exactly how primary neurons respond to immune signals is still largely unknown. We find that primary sympathetic neurons respond unexpectedly to interferon-gamma (IFN-g), a cytokine released by immune cells in response to infection. While IFN-g induces apoptosis in many cell types, it has the opposite effect on sympathetic neurons by protecting them from apoptotic stimuli. We found that IFN-g addition enabled sympathetic neurons to become resistant to nerve growth factor (NGF) deprivation- or pan-kinase inhibition-induced apoptosis. In investigating how interferon modulates the apoptotic pathway, we discovered that c-jun phosphorylation and Bim induction in response to NGF deprivation were unchanged with IFN-g. Downstream of the mitochondria, however, IFN-g blocked cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation in NGF-deprived neurons. Microinjection of cytochrome c into XIAP-/- neurons revealed no difference in cell death with IFN-g addition, demonstrating a role for IFN-g at the point of mitochondria permeabilization. Levels of Bax and Bcl-XL, molecules that help regulate mitochondrial permeabilization, were unchanged.

We inferred developmental stages and critical genes based on observations at 7 time points spanning embryonic, postnatal and adult life. In wild-type footpads, sweat gland germs were detected at E17.5. The coiling of secretory portions started at postnatal day 1 (P1), and sweat gland formation was essentially complete by P5. Consistent with a controlled morphological progression, expression profiling revealed stage-specific gene expression changes. Similar to the development of hair follicles the other major skin appendage controlled by EDA sweat gland induction and initial progression was accompanied by Eda-dependent up-regulation of the Shh pathway. During the further development of sweat gland secretory portions, Foxa1 and Foxi1, not at all expressed in hair follicles, were progressively up-regulated in wild-type but not in Tabby footpads.

Calorie restriction (CR) is one of the most robust means to improve health and survival in model organisms.

In rodents, CR induces the upregulation of two NADH-dehydrogenases, namely NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1) and cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (Cyb5r3), which provide electrons for energy metabolism. It has been proposed that this upregulation may be responsible for some of the beneficial effects of CR, and defects in their activity are linked to aging and several age-associated diseases.

Gas- and Gai-coupled receptors have been reported to regulate lipolysis, and Gaq-coupled receptors stimulate glucose uptake in adipocytes. However, the roles of Ga12/13-coupled receptors in WAT are totally unknown. Here we show that lysophosphatidic acid receptor 4 (LPA4), an adipose cluster GPCR, selectively activates Ga12/13 proteins in adipocytes, and limits continuous remodeling and healthy expansion of WAT in mice.

Transcription factor p63 is a key regulator of stratified epithelia. In humans mutations in p63 are associated with developmental disorders that manifest defects in stratified epithelia including the epidermis. We established an epidermal commitment model using human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and characterized differentiation defects of PSCs carrying p63 mutations. Transcriptome analyses revealed distinct phases of epidermal commitment, multipotent simple epithelial, basal stratified epithelial and mature epidermal fates. Differentiation defects of p63 mutant PSCs occurred during the specification switch from the simple epithelium to the basal stratified epithelial fate. Single-cell transcriptome and pseudotime analyses identified enhanced mesodermal signatures associated with the deviated commitment route of p63 mutant PSCs. Repressing mesodermal differentiation improved epidermal commitment of PSCs. Our study demonstrate that p63 is required for specification of stratified epithelia but not sufficient for epidermal maturation. It provides insights into disease mechanisms underlying defects of stratified epithelia caused by p63 mutations. Examination of gene expression during during epithelial differentiation.",

OBF1, also known as Bob.1 or OCA-B, is a B lymphocyte-specific transcription factor which coactivates Oct1 and Oct2 on B cell specific promoters. So far, the function of OBF1 has been mainly identified in late stage B cell populations. The central defect of OBF1 deficient mice is a severely reduced immune response to T cell-dependent antigens and a lack of germinal center formation in the spleen. Relatively little is known about a potential function of OBF1 in developing B cells. Here we have generated transgenic mice overexpressing OBF1 in B cells under the control of the immunoglobulin heavy chain promoter and enhancer. Surprisingly, these mice have greatly reduced numbers of follicular B cells in the periphery and have a compromised immune response. Furthermore, B cell differentiation is impaired at an early stage in the bone marrow. A first block is observed during B cell commitment and a second differentiation block is seen at the large preB2 cell stage. The cells that succeed to escape the block and to differentiate into mature B cells have post-translationally downregulated the expression of transgene, indicating that expression of OBF1 beyond the normal level early in B cell development is deleterious. Indeed ID3, which is a negative regulator of B cell differentiation, is upregulated in the EPLM and preB cells of the transgenic mice. Furthermore ID3 promoter contains an octamer site suggesting that it is a potential OBF-1 direct target gene. These results provide evidence that OBF1 expression has to be tightly regulated in early B cells to allow efficient B lymphocyte differentiation.

    "text": "Gene expression profiling of CD34/CD38 sorted CML cells. BACKGROUND: BCR-ABL1+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by abnormal production of leukemic stem (LSC) and progenitor cells and their spread from the bone marrow into the blood resulting in extramedullary myeloproliferation. So far, little is known about specific markers and functions of LSC in CML.METHODS: We examined the phenotype and function of CD34+/CD38-/Lin- CML LSC by a multi-parameter screen approach employing antibody-phenotyping, mRNA expression profiling, and functional studies, including LSC repopulation experiments in irradiated NOD-SCID-IL-2Rgamma-/- (NSG) mice, followed by marker-validation using diverse control-cohorts and follow-up samples of CML patients treated with imatinib.RESULTS: Of all LSC markers examined, dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV=CD26) was identified as specific and functionally relevant surface marker-enzyme on CD34+/CD38- CML LSC. CD26 was not detected on normal CD34+/CD38- stem cells or LSC in other hematopoietic malignancies. The percentage of CD26+ CML LSC decreased to undetectable levels during successful treatment with imatinib in all patients (p<0.001). Whereas the sorted CD26- stem cells obtained from CML patients engrafted irradiated NSG mice with multilineage BCR-ABL1-negative hematopoiesis, CD26+ LSC engrafted NSG mice with BCR-ABL1+ cells. Functionally, CD26 was identified as target-enzyme disrupting the SDF-1alpha-CXCR4-axis by cleaving SDF-1alpha a chemotaxin for CXCR4+ stem cells. Whereas CD26 was found to inhibit SDF-1alpha-induced migration, CD26-targeting gliptins reverted this effect and blocked the mobilization of CML LSC in a stroma co-culture assay.CONCLUSIONS: CD26 is a robust biomarker of LSC and a useful tool for their quantification and isolation in patients with BCR/ABL1+ CML. Moreover, CD26 expression may explain the extramedullary spread of LSC in CML. To define specific mRNA expression patterns and to identify specific LSC markers in CML LSC, gene array analyses were performed. RNA was isolated from sorted CD34+/CD45+/CD38- CML LSC, CD34+/CD45+/CD38+ CML progenitor cells, CML MNC, sorted CD34+/CD38- cord blood (CB) SC, CB-derived CD34+/CD38+ progenitor cells, and CB MNC. Total RNA was extracted from sorted cells using RNeasy Micro-Kit (Qiagen) and used (100 ng total RNA) for Gene Chip analyses. Preparation of terminal-labeled cRNA, hybridization to genome-wide human PrimeView GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and scanning of arrays were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocols (https://www.affymetrix.com). Robust Multichip Average (RMA) signal extraction and normalization were performed according to http://www.bioconductor.org/ as described.18 Differences in mRNA expression levels (from multiple paired samples) were calculated as mRNA ratio of i) CML LSC versus CB SC, ii) CML LSC versus CD34+/CD38+ CML progenitors, and normal cord blood SC versus cord blood progenitors. To calculate differential gene expression between individual sample groups where appropriate, we performed a statistical comparison using the LIMMA package as described previously. Briefly, LIMMA estimates the fold change between predefined sample groups by fitting a linear model and using an empirical Bayes method to moderate the standard errors of the estimated log-fold changes for each probe set.",

    "text": "A histone H3.3 Lysine 36 Trimethylation Reader Connects Chromatin to Regulated Pre-mRNA Processing. BS69 (aka ZMYND11) was initially discovered as a direct target of adenoviral E1A oncoprotein1. Subsequent studies implicated BS69 as a tumor suppressor and a transcriptional regulator2. But exactly how BS69 regulates gene expression has remained elusive. BS69 contains tandemly arranged PHD, BROMO and PWWP domains, which are known to function as chromatin recognition modalities. Here we show that BS69 selectively recognizes histone variant H3.3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3.3K36me3) via these chromatin recognition modules. Using a proteomics approach, we further identified association of BS69 with a host of RNA splicing regulators including EFTUD2 and other U5 snRNP components of the spliceosome. Remarkably, RNA-seq analysis shows that BS69 mainly regulates intron retention (IR), which is one of the least well-understood RNA alternative splicing events in mammalian cells. Specifically, loss of BS69 results in a decrease in IR, while in contrast, knockdown of EFTUD2 leads to an increase in IR, consistent with its role as a core member of the splicesome machinery. Importantly, wildtype BS69, but not a BS69 mutant defective in its interaction with EFTUD2, rescues the IR events. We also show that knockdown of SETD2, the main enzyme that mediates H3K36 trimethylation3, similarly results in a decreased retention of the same introns regulated by BS69. Significantly, a BS69 mutant unable to bind H3.3K36me3 in vitro fails to rescue the reduced IR phenotype associated with the loss of BS69. Taken together, our findings identify an antagonistic relationship between BS69 and the core splicing machinery and demonstrate that BS69-mediated RNA splicing regulation is dependent both on its ability to bind chromatin decorated by H3K36me3 and its ability to physically interact with the core spliceosome machinery. Our study reveals a novel and unexpected role of BS69 in connecting histone H3.3K36 trimethylation to regulated RNA splicing, providing significant new insights into chromatin regulation of RNA splicing. HeLa cells were infected with lentiviruses carrying control and BS69 shRNA and deep sequencing data were generated, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000.",

Gaucher disease type 1 is an inborn error of metabolic disease with the defective activity of the lysosomal enzyme acid b-glucosidase (GCase). Enzyme replacement/reconstitution therapy (ERT), infusions with purified recombinant GCases, is efficacious in reversing hematologic, hepatic, splenic, and bony disease manifestations in Gaucher type 1 patients. However, the tissue specific molecular events in Gaucher disease and their response to therapy are not known yet. To explore the molecular events underlying GCase treatment, we evaluated the tissue-specific gene expression profiles and molecular responses in our Gaucher disease mouse model, which were treated with two FDA approved commercially available GCases, imiglucerase (imig) and velaglucerase alfa (vela). Using microarray and mRNA-Seq techniques, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the spleen and liver by the direct comparison of imig- vs. vela-treated mice. Among them three gene expression networks were derived from these spleens: 1) cell division/proliferation, 2) hematopoietic system and 3) inflammatory/macrophage response. Our study showed the occurrence of differential molecular pathophysiologic processes in the mice treated with imig compared with vela even though these two biosimilars had the same histological and biochemical efficacy. 9V/null mice (Gaucher mouse model) were injected weekly via tail vein with 60U/kg/wk of imig or vela for 8 wks and were sacrificed one week after the injection for RNA isolation from different tissues like liver, lung and spleen.",

Crohn's disease is characterized by transmural inflammation and therefore the mesenteric immune compartment has gained interest. However, its significance in Crohn's disease is largely unclear. Macrophages are plastic cells that adapt their phenotype to environmental stimuli resulting in inflammatory and regulatory macrophage subsets. Hence, their distribution can reflect the overall nature of an immune infiltrate. We show that mesenteric macrophages contain two populations, characterized as CD11b-high and CD11b-dim. The CD11b-dim population is characterized by expression of regulatory markers CD206, CD200R, CD163, PD-L2, CD32. CD11b-high macrophages display an IFNg induced signature and produce high levels of calprotectin. CD11b-dim and CD11b-high populations were comparable between Crohn's disease and other indications in expression pattern, but the CD11b-high population was strongly overrepresented in this patient group. CD11b-high macrophages were isolated from the mesentery of patients undergoing bowel resection (n=12).

NO regulated 110 transcripts that annotated disproportionately to the cell cycle and cell proliferation (47/110, 43%) and more frequently than expected contained AU-rich, post-transcriptional regulatory elements (ARE). Bt2cAMP regulated 106 genes; cell cycle gene enrichment did not reach significance. Like NO, Bt2cAMP was associated with ARE-containing transcripts. Cell cycle genes induced by NO were G1/S phase associated (7/8) including E2F1 and p21/Waf1/Cip1; 6 of these 7 were E2F target genes involved in G1/S transition.

These genes were associated with movement of leukocytes were identified including a group of genes for NK cell movement (CMKLR1, CX3CR1, S1PR5, GNLY and CXCR1) which were slightly higher expressed after automated compared to manual expansion. Nevertheless, the expansion profiles of NK cells after automated or manual expansion were rather similar in comparison to the remarkable difference between primary and expanded NK cells in general represented by the vast majority of regulated genes between the analyzed sample groups. Pathway analysis revealed that most of regulated genes upon expansion were associated with cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, DNA recombination and DNA repair, regulation of apoptosis and cell survival as well as cytokine signaling. Furthermore, the expression of many NK cell relevant markers was changed upon expansion with the strongest effects on up regulation of TRAIL and FASL, inhibitory TIGIT and chemokine receptors CCR2, CCR5 and CXCR6. In addition, granzyme M was down regulated but other important effector molecules like TNFa, perforin and granzymes A, B and K were up regulated. In summary we could show that manual and automatically expanded NK cells show a similar expansion profile while the differ significantly from primary NK cells. Up regulation of many NK cell relevant markers indicate for an enhanced NK cell functionaility after ex vivo activation and expansion. 24 samples were analyzed in total. 6 biological replicates represented by cells from different donors. 4 different samples per donor: freshly isolated NK cells (d0) and NK cells expanded for 14 days under 3 different conditions: in co-culture with EBV-LCL feeder cells and 500 U/mL IL2 either cultivated manually in T75 flasks (T) or automatically using the CliniMACS Prodigy system (P); NK cells cultured with 500 U/ml IL2 without feeder cells (I).",

The molecular regulation of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in mammals remains poorly understood. Primed mouse embryonic stem cells contain a rare subset of \"2C-like\" cells that are epigenetically and transcriptionally similar to the two cell embryo and thus represent an ideal system for studying ZGA transcription regulation. Recently, the transcription factor Dux, expressed exclusively in the minor wave of ZGA, was described to activate many downstream ZGA transcripts. However, it remains unknown what upstream maternal factors initiate ZGA either in a Dux dependent or independent manner. Here we performed a candidate-based overexpression screen, identifying, amongst others, Developmental Pluripotency Associated 2 (Dppa2) and 4 (Dppa4) as positive regulators of 2C-like cells and ZGA transcription. In the germ line, promoter DNA demethylation coincides with upregulation of Dppa2 and Dppa4 which remain expressed until E7.5 when their promoters are remethylated. Furthermore, Dppa2 and Dppa4 are also expressed during iPSC reprogramming at the time 2C-like ZGA transcription transiently peaks. Through a combination of overexpression, knockdown, knockout and rescue experiments, together with transcriptional analyses, we show that Dppa2 and Dppa4 directly regulate the 2C-like cell population and associated transcripts, including Dux and the Zscan4 cluster. Importantly, we tease apart the molecular hierarchy in which the 2C-like transcriptional program is initiated and stabilised. Dppa2 and Dppa4 require Dux to initiate 2C-like ZGA transcription, suggesting they act upstream by directly regulating Dux. Supporting this, ChIP-seq analysis revealed Dppa2 and Dppa4 bind to the Dux promoter and gene body and drive its expression. Zscan4c is also able to induce 2C-like cells in wild type cells, but, in contrast to Dux, can no longer do so in Dppa2/4 double knockout cells, suggesting it may act to stabilise rather than drive the transcriptional network. Our findings suggest a model in which Dppa2/4 binding to the Dux promoter leads to Dux upregulation and activation of the 2C-like transcriptional program which is subsequently reinforced by Zscan4c.

The identification of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) susceptibility genes by genome-wide association has linked this pathology to autophagy, a lysosomal degradation pathway that is crucial for cell and tissue homeostasis. Here, we describe autophagin-1 (ATG4B) as an essential protein in the control of inflammatory response during experimental colitis. In this pathological condition, ATG4B protein levels increase paralleling the induction of autophagy. Moreover, ATG4B expression is significantly reduced in affected areas of the colon from IBD patients. Consistently, atg4b-/- mice present Paneth cell abnormalities, as well as an increased susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis. Atg4b-deficient mice exhibit significant alterations in proinflammatory cytokines and mediators of the immune response to bacterial infections, which are reminiscent of those found in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Additionally, antibiotic treatments and bone marrow transplantation from wild-type mice reduced colitis in atg4b-/- mice. Taken together, these results provide additional evidence on the importance of autophagy in intestinal pathologies and describe ATG4B as a novel protective protein in inflammatory colitis. Finally, we propose that Atg4b-null mice are a suitable model for in vivo studies aimed at testing new therapeutic strategies for intestinal diseases associated with autophagy deficiency. Seven samples were collected in total: three from wild-type mice (1 from the ileum and the colon of control mice, and 1 from the colon of a DSS-treated mouse) and four from Atg4b knock-out mice (1 from the ileum and the colon of control mice, and 2 from the colon of DSS-treated mice).",

This project describes the establishment and validation of a murine orthotopic xenograft model using fresh human tumor samples that recapitulates the critical components of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The authors discuss the proven and theoretical advantages of the model as well as future translational implications.Background: Relevant preclinical models that recapitulate the key features of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are needed in order to provide biologically tractable models to probe disease progression and therapeutic responses and ultimately improve patient outcomes for this disease. Here, we describe the establishment and clinical, pathological, molecular and genetic validation of a murine, orthotopic xenograft model of PDAC. Methods: Human PDACs were resected and orthotopically implanted and propagated in immunocompromised mice. Patient survival was correlated with xenograft growth and metastatic rate in mice. Human and mouse tumor pathology were compared. Tumors were analyzed for genetic mutations, gene expression, receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation, and cytokine expression. Results: Fifteen human PDACs were propagated orthotopically in mice. Xenografts developed peritoneal and liver metastases. Time to growth and metastatic efficiency in mice each correlated with patient survival. Tumor architecture, nuclear grade and stromal content were similar in patient and xenografted tumors. Propagated tumors closely exhibited the genetic and molecular features known to characterize pancreatic cancer (e.g. high rate of KRAS, p53, SMAD4 mutation and EGFR activation). The correlation coefficient of gene expression between patient tumors and xenografts propagated through multiple generations was 93 to 99%. Analysis of gene expression demonstrated distinct differences between xenografts from fresh patient tumors versus commercially available PDAC cell lines. Conclusions: Our orthotopic xenograft model derived from fresh human PDACs closely recapitulates the clinical, pathologic, genetic and molecular aspects of human disease. This model has resulted in the identification of rational therapeutic strategies to be tested in clinical trials and will permit additional therapeutic approaches and identification of biomarkers of response to therapy. 47 Samples in total were generated for normal pancreatic tissue in patients, pancreatic tumors in patients, pancreatic tumors propagated in a mouse xenograft model, and pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro. Clustering analysis was performed to evaluate the differences between patient tumors, xenograft tumors, established cancer cell lines, and cell lines derived from xenografts.",

Genetic studies in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia have uncovered a remarkable complexity of oncogenic and loss-of-function mutations. Amongst this plethora of genetic changes, NOTCH1 activating mutations stand out as the most frequently occurring genetic defect, identified in more than 50% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias, supporting an essential driver role for this gene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia oncogenesis. In this study, we aimed to establish a comprehensive compendium of the long non-coding RNA transcriptome under control of Notch signaling. For this purpose, we measured the transcriptional response of all protein coding genes and long non-coding RNAs upon pharmacological Notch inhibition in the human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CUTLL1 using RNA-sequencing. Similar Notch dependent profiles were established for normal human CD34+ thymic T-cell progenitors exposed to Notch signaling activity in vivo. In addition, we generated long non-coding RNA expression profiles (array data) from GSI treated T-ALL cell lines, ex vivo isolated Notch active CD34+ and Notch inactive CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and from a primary cohort of 15 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with known NOTCH1 mutation status. Integration of these expression datasets with publically available Notch1 ChIP-sequencing data resulted in the identification of long non-coding RNAs directly regulated by Notch activity in normal and malignant T-cell context. Given the central role of Notch in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia oncogenesis, these data pave the way towards development of novel therapeutic strategies that target hyperactive Notch1 signaling in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Obesity is a major risk factor with long-lasting effects on the predisposition to CRC even after weight loss; however, the mechanistic underpinnings remain poorly understood. Using a diet-induced obesity mouse model, we profiled cell-intrinsic alterations in colonic epithelium from young and aged obese mice compared with their age-matched controls, to gain insights into the progression of obesity-associated dysregulations in colonic cellular states. Cellular metabolic reprogramming occurred at early stage, boosting the number and function of stem/stem-like cells; while cell-intrinsic rewiring of signal transduction networks happened at later stage, promoting growth factor-independent proliferation. Strikingly, colonic DNA methylome was pre-programmed by obesity at young age priming for a tumor-prone gene signature after aging. Furthermore, obesity-related changes were substantially preserved after weight loss, potentially contributing to long-term predisposition to CRC. These findings broadened our perspectives on how obesity shapes the predisposition to CRC. Ribo-zero RNA-Seq was performed in colonic epithelium from mice on three different dietary regimens as follows: 1) low-fat diet for 43 weeks; 2) high-fat diet for 43 weeks; 3) high-fat diet for an initial 15 weeks then switched to low-fat diet for another 28 weeks.",

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (IBU) and analgesic drugs, such as acetaminophen (APAP), are the most frequently medications taken by pregnant women, even in combination. They were shown to target fetal gonadal development acting as endocrine disruptors, that might favour genital malformations in new-born boys and reproductive disorders in adults, in an intergenerational manner. However, the consequences on postnatal ovarian development and female reproductive health after in utero exposure are still unknown. Here, we show that in utero exposure to therapeutic doses of the widely used APAP-IBU combination during the sensitive window of sex determination leads to an increased proliferation of female embryonic germ cells and a delayed entry into meiosis in 13.5dpc exposed ovaries. Consequently, the primordial follicle formation is enhanced in postnatal ovaries and is followed by a reduced follicular activation through the Akt/FoxO3 pathway and an increased follicular apoptosis. Subsequently, a reduced ovarian reserve in adult ovaries of exposed animals and in their offspring (F1) is observed. This leads to the subfertility of 6-month-old F1 animals that show an accelerated ovarian aging, a Premature Ovarian Insufficiency-like phenotype, with an abnormal persistence of corpora lutea due to the decreased apoptosis and an increased luteal Akt-mediated cell survival. Our data suggest that the use of APAP+IBU during this critical period of development that occurs during the first trimester of gestation (6 to 10 weeks), could lead in humans to adverse effects that could be passed to the offspring. mRNA profiles of 13.5 days post coitum wild type and APAP+IBU exposed ovaries were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate.",

The Wnt signaling pathway is involved in many differentiation events during embryonic development and can lead to tumor formation after aberrant activation of its components. B-catenin, a cytoplasmic component, plays a major role in the transduction of the canonical wnt/ b-catenin signaling. The aim of this study was to identify novel genes that are regulated by active b-catenin/TCF signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma. We selected and expanded isogenic clones from hepatocellular carcinoma-derived Huh7 cells with high and low b-catenin/TCF activities. We showed that, high TCF activity Huh7 cells lead to bigger and more aggressive tumors when xenografted into nude mice. We used SAGE (Serial Analysis of Gene Expression), genome-wide microarray and in silico promoter analysis in parallel, to compare gene expression between low (basal) and high (transfected) b-catenin/TCF activity clones, those had been xenografted into nude mice. We compared and contrasted SAGE and genome-wide microarray data, in parallel. Finally; after combined analysis, we identified BRI3 and HSF2 as novel targets of Wnt/b-catenin signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma.

Developmental pathways that orchestrate the fleeting transition of endothelial cells into haematopoietic stem cells remain undefined. Here we demonstrate a tractable approach for fully reprogramming adult mouse endothelial cells to haematopoietic stem cells (rEC-HSCs) through transient expression of the transcription-factor-encoding genes Fosb, Gfi1, Runx1, and Spi1 (collectively denoted hereafter as FGRS) and vascular-niche-derived angiocrine factors. The induction phase (days 0-8) of conversion is initiated by expression of FGRS in mature endothelial cells, which results in endogenous Runx1 expression. During the specification phase (days 8-20), RUNX1+ FGRS-transduced endothelial cells commit to a haematopoietic fate, yielding rEC-HSCs that no longer require FGRS expression. The vascular niche drives a robust self-renewal and expansion phase of rEC-HSCs (days 20-28). rEC-HSCs have a transcriptome and long-term self-renewal capacity similar to those of adult haematopoietic stem cells, and can be used for clonal engraftment and serial primary and secondary multi-lineage reconstitution, including antigen-dependent adaptive immune function. Inhibition of TGF? and CXCR7 or activation of BMP and CXCR4 signalling enhanced generation of rEC-HSCs.

Purpose: The oxidation resistance gene 1 (OXR1) is crucial for protecting against oxidative stress, limiting neurodegeneration and maintaining normal lifespan in eukaryotes. However, the molecular function of OXR1 is still unknown. Previously we showed that human OXR1 regulates expression of antioxidant genes GPX2 and HO-1 via the p21 signaling pathway. To examine the role of hOXR1 in global transcription regulation during cellular stress, we employed RNA sequencing to investigate the transcription profile in hOXR1 depleted HeLa cells.Methods: Control siRNA (siCon) and human OXR1 siRNA (siOXR1) transfected HeLa cells were either harvested directly (siCon_NT, siOXR1_NT) or exposed to 0.5 mM H2O2 for 1 h and then harvested immediately without recovery (siCon_R0h, siOXR1_R0h). Total RNA pooled from duplicate samples was used for RNA sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at gene level. The Blast2GO program was used to generate gene ontology (GO) annotation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs).The WEGO software was used to further perform GO functional classification and to predict pathways affected. qRT-PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays.Results: In total, in non-treated and hydrogen peroxide exposed cells, hOXR1 depletion results in the down-regulation of 554 genes and the up-regulation of 253 genes. These differentially expressed genes include transcription factors (i.e. HIF1A, SP6, E2F8 and TCF3) and numerous genes of the p53 signaling pathway involved in cell-cycle arrest (i.e. cyclin D, CDK6 and p21) and apoptosis (i.e. CytC and CASP9). Western blot analysis reveals that hOXR1 suppresses CASP9 protein expression and reduces post-translational cleavage into its active form. After exposure to hydrogen peroxide (1 h), 56 early response genes were up-regulated in hOXR1 depleted cells, in which 38 of these genes were not induced in control cells. In addition, a subset of the commonly up-regulated early response genes showed a stronger induction in hOXR1 depleted cells (i.e. FOS, JUN and DUSP1). Out of a total of 52 differentially expressed transcription factors in hOXR1 depleted cells under normal physiology and oxidative stress condition, 14 genes (including HIF1A, STAT5A, E2F8 and TCF3) are differentially regulated under H2O2 treatment in hOXR1 silenced cells as compared to control cells. Finally, we demonstrate that hOXR1 depleted cells undergo cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase during oxidative stress.Conclusions: Human OXR1 is important for regulation of the early stress response to oxidative stress in HeLa cells. HOXR1 modulates the p53 signaling pathway via regulation of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and anti-oxidation. Further, hOXR1 regulates numerous transcription factors of importance for cellular stress responses. In summary, hOXR1 may act as a sensor of cellular oxidative stress to regulate the transcriptional networks required to detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulate cell cycle arrest and cell death (apoptosis). The mRNA profiles of hOXR1 depleted and control Hela cells with or without H2O2 treatment 1 h were generated by RNA sequencing using Illumina Hiseq 2000.",

    "text": "FOXA1 actively represses the molecular phenotype of basal breast cancers. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease comprised of at least five major subtypes. Luminal subtype tumors confer a more favorable patient prognosis, which is in part, attributed to the Estrogen Receptor-a (ER) positivity and anti-hormone responsiveness of these tumors. Expression of the forkhead box transcription factor, FOXA1, also correlates with the luminal subtype and patient survival, but is present in a subset of ER-negative tumors. Similarly, FOXA1 is consistently expressed in luminal breast cancer cell lines even in the absence of ER. In contrast, basal breast cancer cell lines do not express FOXA1, and loss of FOXA1 in luminal cells increases migration and invasion, characteristics of the basal subtype. To delineate an ER-independent role for FOXA1 in maintaining the luminal phenotype, and hence a more favorable prognosis, we performed cDNA microarray analyses on luminal FOXA1-positive, ER-positive (MCF7, T47D) and FOXA1-positive, ER-negative (MDA-MB-453, SKBR3) cell lines in the presence or absence of transient FOXA1 silencing. This resulted in three FOXA1 transcriptomes: (1) a luminal-signature (consistent across cell lines), (2) an ER-positive signature (restricted to MCF7 and T47D) and (3) an ER-negative signature (restricted to MDA-MB-453 and SKBR3). Use of Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) as a phenotyping tool revealed that FOXA1 silencing resulted in a transcriptome shift from luminal to basal gene expression signatures. FOXA1 binds to both luminal and basal genes within luminal breast cancer cells, suggesting that it not only transactivates luminal genes, but also represses basal-associated genes. From these results we conclude that FOXA1 controls plasticity between basal and luminal cells, playing a dominant role in repressing the basal phenotype, and thus tumor aggressiveness, in luminal breast cancer cells. Although it has been proposed that FOXA1-targeting agents may be useful for treating luminal tumors, these data suggest that this approach may promote transitions toward a more aggressive cancer.

Here we found that Plk1 phosphorylated residue Thr76 in VCP/p97, an AAA-ATPase mainly involved in protein homeostasis, at centrosome from prophase to anaphase. This phosphorylation recruited VCP to centrosome to regulate centrosome orientation. VCP also exhibited strong co-localization with Eg5, a mitotic kinesin motor for centrosome movement, at mitotic spindle, and dephosphorylation of Thr76 in VCP was required for the enrichment of VCP and Eg5 to the spindle, thus, ensuring proper spindle orientation and chromosome segregation. Since genome instability is the hallmark of cancer and the phosphorylation of Thr76 in VCP is important for proper centrosome movement, spindle orientation, and chromosome segregation, we, thus, knocked down VCP in MDA-MB-231cells by its specific shRNA, and reconstituted the expression of VCP by infecting the cells with lentivirus encoding shRNA-resistant Flag-VCPWT or Flag-VCPT76A.

Consequently, creatine maintained a reduction of reactive oxygen species and change of the a-ketoglutarate/succinate ratio leading to an inhibition of the HIF-signaling in primary tumor cell lines. These effects shifted the transcriptional pattern toward a proneural subtype and reduced the rate of cell migration and invasion in vitro. For metabolic treatment, different metabolites were supplemented into the medium. Creatine-enriched environment was simulated by 15 mMol creatine supplementation. Cells were cultured under normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (3% O2) conditions.",

Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is a valuable source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for use in allogeneic transplantation. Key advantages of UCB are rapid availability and less stringent requirements for HLA matching. However, UCB contains an inherently limited HSC count, which is associated with delayed time to engraftment, high graft failure rates and early mortality. 16,16 dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2) was previously identified to be a critical regulator of HSC homeostasis and we hypothesized that a brief ex vivo modulation could improve patient outcomes by increasing the \"effective dose\" of HSCs.Molecular profiling with Affymetrix GeneChips were used to evaluate if increasing the concentration of prostaglandin at 25 and 37 deg C could increase biological responses. Isolated human CD34+ cells from umbilical cord blood were incubated ex vivo in Stem Span (SS) media evaluating five concentrations of 16,16-dmPGE2 (0.1uM, 1uM, 10uM, 50uM, and 100uM) or Vehicle (DMSO) for 2 hours at 25 or 37 deg C.

Alterations in chromatin modifications, including DNA methylation and histone modification patterns, have been characterized under exposure of several environmental pollutants, including nickel. As with other carcinogenic metals, the mutagenic potential of nickel compounds is low and is not well correlated with its carcinogenic effects. Nickel exposure, however, is associated with alterations in chromatin modifications and related transcriptional programs, suggesting an alternative pathway whereby nickel exposure can lead to disease. To investigate the extent to which nickel exposure disrupts chromatin patterns, we profiled several histone modifications, including H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 as well as the insulator binding protein CTCF and the transcriptomes of control BEAS-2B cells and cells treated with nickel for 72 hours. Our results show significant alterations of the repressive histone modification H3K9me2 in nickel-exposed cells with spreading of H3K9me2 into new domains associated with gene silencing. We furthermore show that local regions of active chromatin can protect genes from nickel-induced H3K9me2 spreading. Interestingly, we show that nickel exposure selectively disrupts weaker CTCF sites, leading to spreading of H3K9me2 at these regions. These results have major implications in the understanding of how environmental carcinogens can affect chromatin dynamics and the consequences of chromatin domain disruption in disease progression. Treat BEAS-2B cells with NiCl2 for 72 hours and compare histone modification, CTCF binding to control BEAS-2B cells to see how they regulated gene expression by RNA-seq.",

Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) have an extensive potential for clinical applications in cell therapy. However, very little is known of the specific molecular regulatory mechanisms that control the therapeutical properties of these cells. We aimed to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that could be involved in controlling the transition between the self-renewing (undifferentiated) and the reparative (differentiated) phenotypes of hMSCs. MicroRNA microarrays were used to identify miRNAs that are upregulated in undifferentiated hMSCs. For that, we compared the miRNA expression profiles of undifferentiated bone marrow-derived hMSCs with the same primary cell lines after 9 days of in vitro adipogenic or osteogenic induction. We also compared the miRNA expression profiles of undifferentiated hMSCs with skin fibroblasts (a mesenchymal cell lineage with a more restricted differentiation potential). These experiments allowed us to identify miR-335 as the only miRNA downregulated upon MSC differentiation as well as in MSCs in comparison with skin fibroblasts. Gene expression microarrays were used to identify genes that are downregulated in hMSCs overexpressing miR-335. We compared the miRNA expression profiles of hMSCs transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding miR-335 with MSCs transduced with a control lentiviral vector.

The maintenance of advanced malignancies relies on continued activity of driver oncogenes, although their rate-limiting role is highly context-dependent with respect to tumor types and associated genetic alterations. Oncogenic Kras mutation is the signature event in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), serving a critical role in tumor initiation. Here, an inducible KrasG12D-driven p53 mutant PDAC mouse model establishes that advanced PDAC remains strictly dependent on continued KrasG12D expression and that KrasG12D serves a vital role in the control of tumor metabolism, through stimulation of glucose uptake and channeling of glucose intermediates through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Notably, these studies reveal that oncogenic Kras regulates ribose biogenesis. Unlike canonical models of PPP-mediated ribose biogenesis, we demonstrate that oncogenic Kras drives intermediates from enhanced glycolytic flux into the non-oxidative arm of the PPP, thereby decoupling ribose biogenesis from NADPNADPH-mediated redox control. Together, this work provides in vivo mechanistic insights into how oncogenic Kras promotes metabolic reprogramming in native tumors and illuminates potential metabolic targets that can be exploited for therapeutic benefit in Kras-driven PDAC. Primary pancreatic tumor lines were established from p48Cre tetO_LKrasG12D ROSA_rtTAL+ p53L+ mice.

For in vitro expression profiles, the same five tumor lines were cultured in the presence or absence of doxycycline for 24 hours and total cellular RNA was prepared.

Background and Aims: RNA biomarkers derived from sloughed enterocytes would provide an ideal, non-invasive method for early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) and precancerous adenomas. To realize this goal, a highly reliable method to isolate preserved human RNA from stool samples is needed. Here we develop a protocol to identify RNA biomarkers associated with CRC to assess the use of these biomarkers for noninvasive screening of disease.Methods: Stool samples were collected from 454 patients prior to a colonoscopy. A nucleic acid extraction protocol was developed to isolate human RNA from 330 stool samples and transcript abundances were estimated by microarray analysis. This 330-patient cohort was split into a training set of 265 individuals to develop a machine learning model and a testing set of 65 individuals to determine the model's ability to detect colorectal neoplasms.Results: Analysis of the transcriptome from 265 individuals identified 200 transcript clusters as differentially expressed (p<0.03). These transcripts were used to build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based model to classify 65 individuals within the testing set. This SVM algorithm attained a 95% sensitivity for precancerous adenomas and a 65% sensitivity for CRC (stage I-IV). The machine learning algorithm attained a specificity of 59% for healthy individuals and an overall accuracy of 72.3%.Conclusions: We developed an RNA-based neoplasm detection model that is sensitive for CRC and precancerous adenomas. The model allows for non-invasive assessment of tumors and could potentially be used to provide clinical guidance for individuals within the screening population for colorectal cancer. Total RNA was isolated from 338 stool samples and the transcriptome was assessed using the Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0. Differentially expressed genes were identified using the transcript fold change between healthy and diseased individuals. These transcriptomes were used to build a machine learning algorithm to classify individuals as diseased or not diseased.Reference samples are 'normal,' cases are 'adenomas' or 'cancer'.",

    "text": "Brain microvessel: Alzheimer disease vs normal. The enigma that is Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to present daunting challenges for effective therapeutic intervention. The lack of disease-modifying therapies may, in part, be attributable to the narrow research focus employed to understand this complex disease. Most studies into disease pathogenesis are based on a priori assumptions about the role of AD lesion-associated proteins such as amyloid-b and tau. However, the complex disease processes at work may not be amenable to single-target therapeutic approaches. Genome-wide expression studies provide an unbiased approach for investigating the pathogenesis of complex diseases like AD. A growing literature suggests a role for cerebrovascular contributions to the pathogenesis of AD. The objective of the current study is to examine human brain microvessels isolated from AD patients and controls by microarray analysis. Differentially expressed genes with more than 2-fold change are used for further data analysis. Gene ontology analysis and pathway analysis algorithms within GeneSpringGX are employed to understand the regulatory networks of differentially expressed genes. Twelve matched pairs of AD and control brain microvessel samples are hybridized to Agilent Human 4 x 44 K arrays in replication. We document that more than 2,000 genes are differentially altered in AD microvessels and that a large number of these genes map to pathways associated with immune and inflammatory response, signal transduction, and nervous system development and function categories. These data may help elucidate heretofore unknown molecular alterations in the AD cerebromicrovasculature. Two condition experiment, diseased vs normal, our study included 12 pairs of biological replicates and each pair was repeated with dye swap making total of 24 double channel hybridizations. we excluded 4 samples for not passing QC. So 20 samples were included in the data analysis.",

(5R)-5-hydroxytriptolide (LLDT-8) is an extracted compound from Tripterygium, which has been showed lower cytotoxicity and relatively higher immunosuppressive activity. However, the knowledge on its genomic impact is still limited.Methods: The purpose of our study was to assess the effects of LLDT-8 on transcriptome including mRNAs and lncRNAs in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes cell by a custom genome-wide microarray assay.Results: Our work showed that 394 significantly differentially expressed gene including 281 significantly down-regulated and 113 significantly up-regulated after the treatment of LLDT-8. Also, KEGG pathway analysis showed 20 pathways were significantly enriched (P-value <0.05, FDR correction). Morever, the top 4 enriched pathway were significant relevant to Immune reaction, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (P-value=4.61x10-13), rheumatoid arthritis (P-value=1.90x10-6), chemokine signaling pathway (P-value=1.01x10-5) and TNF signaling pathway (P-value=2.79x10-4).

The cortical area map is initially patterned by transcription factor (TF) gradients in the neocortical primordium, which define a protomap in the embryonic ventricular zone (VZ). However, mechanisms that propagate regional identity from VZ progenitors to cortical plate (CP) neurons are unknown. Here we show that the VZ, subventricular zone (SVZ), and CP contain distinct molecular maps of regional identity, reflecting different gene expression gradients in radial glia progenitors, intermediate progenitors, and projection neurons, respectively. The intermediate map in SVZ is modulated by Eomes (also known as Tbr2), a T-box TF. Eomes inactivation caused rostrocaudal shifts in SVZ and CP gene expression, with loss of corticospinal axons and gain of corticotectal projections. These findings suggest that cortical areas and connections are shaped by sequential maps of regional identity, propagated by the Pax6 - Eomes - Tbr1 TF cascade. In humans, PAX6, EOMES, and TBR1 have been linked to intellectual disability and autism. To determine the role of Eomes in the propagation of the protomap to cortical plate neurons, used microarray analysis of E14.5 cortex from five wild type and three Eomes knockout mice.",

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binds the human genome at >10,000 sites, but only regulates the expression of hundreds of genes. To determine the functional effect of each site, we measured the glucocorticoid (GC) responsive activity of nearly all GR binding sites (GBSs) captured using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in A549 cells. 13% of GBSs assayed had GC-induced activity. The responsive sites were defined by direct GR binding via a GC response element (GRE) and exclusively increased reporter- gene expression. Meanwhile, most GBSs lacked GC-induced reporter activity. The non-responsive sites had epigenetic features of steady state enhancers and clustered around direct GBSs. Together, our data support a model in which clusters of GBSs observed with ChIP-seq reflect interactions between direct and tethered GBSs over tens of kilobases. We further show that those interactions can synergistically modulate the activity of direct GBSs, and may therefore play a major role in driving gene activation in response to GCs. Glucoroticoid receptor binding site chip-seq libraries were cloned into STARR-seq for massively parallel functional analysis. The results were confirmed by ChIP-Exo performed on the GR in A549 cells treated with 100 nM dexamethasone for one hour.This dataset [1] contains rna seq from BAC DNA tagments (nucleic acids that have been treated with Nextera transposase to fragment the nucleic acids and add sequencing adapters) cloned into the STARR-seq plasmid backbone, transfected into A549 cells and treated with DEX or ETOH.",

Background: Regulation of the mRNA life cycle is central to gene expression control and determination of cell fate. miRNAs represent a critical mRNA regulatory mechanism, but despite decades of research, their mode of action is still not fully understood.Results: Here, we show that eIF4A2 is a major effector of the repressive miRNA pathway functioning via the Ccr4-Not complex. We demonstrate that while DDX6 interacts with Ccr4-Not, its effects in the mechanism are not as pronounced. Through its interaction with the Ccr4- Not complex, eIF4A2 represses mRNAs at translation initiation. We show evidence that native eIF4A2 has similar RNA-selectivity to chemically inhibited eIF4A1. eIF4A2 exerts its repressive effect by binding purine-rich motifs which are enriched in the 5'UTR of target mRNAs directly upstream of the AUG start codon.Conclusions: Our data support a model whereby purine motifs towards the 3' end of the 5'UTR are associated with increased ribosome occupancy and possible uORF activation upon eIF4A2 binding.

Pathway expression analysis in systemic sclerosis revealed key mediators driving pathology within each of the intrinsic gene expression subsets.Genome-wide expression profiling in systemic sclerosis (SSc) has identified four 'intrinsic' subsets of disease (fibroproliferative, inflammatory, limited, and normal-like), each of which appear to be driven by distinct signaling pathways. Here we examine experimentally derived gene expression signatures for thirteen agonists to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying each intrinsic subsets. Pathway-specific gene signatures were compared against skin biopsy microarray data consisting of 329 microarray hybridizations from 287 unique biopsies representing 111 patients. Hierarchical clustering recapitulated the four SSc 'intrinsic' gene expression subsets, along with an intermediate subset exhibiting both inflammatory and fibroproliferative gene expression signatures. The fibroproliferative subset is most strongly associated with the PDGF gene signature, while the inflammatory subset demonstrated strong activation of NF-kappaB, characterized by early induction of TH2 signals, which transitions to a more TH17-like immune response over time. The limited subset was associated with IFNalpha signaling, combined with strong downregulation of PDGF signaling. The inflammatory-proliferative subset shows downregulation of NF-kappaB-associated pathways in conjunction with increased PDGF signaling, suggestive of a transitional state linking the inflammatory and fibroproliferative subsets. IL-13 signaling was strongly associated with early disease, while TGFbeta signaling was associated with more severe disease. Together these data suggest a multi-step, progressive model of disease pathogenesis driven by distinct pathways. Targeting these pathways based upon a patient's underlying disease subset should improve therapeutic outcomes. In vitro treatment of human dermal fibroblasts was performed to identify pathway-specific gene signatures. These gene signatures were then compared against systemic sclerosis skin biopsy microarrays to determine the overall contribution of each pathway to disease.This study includes re-analysis of 247 skin biopsy samples from GSE9285, GSE32413, and GSE45485.

Oviductal epithelium is equivalent to human FTE. Serial passaging of the outbred mouse CD1 oviductal cells (MOE low) to MOE high produced transformed cells that lead to benign tumors. To understand the altered molecular signaling pathways in MOEhigh cells versus MOElow cells, we performed RNA sequencing. Total RNA was extracted from MOELOW (passages 8, 9, & 10) and MOEHIGH (passages 90, 103, & 113) cells. Each total RNA sample had ribosomal RNA removed using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Strand-specific libraries were constructed and quantitated using Qubit, and cDNAs verified by qPCR. qRT-PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. Samples were barcoded and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencing. The reads were aligned to the Mus musculus genome (mm10) using TopHat, version and were used to determine the expression of known mmu10 gene annotations from the University of California-Santa Cruz website using Cuffdiff version. By merging the individual transcript from Cuffdiff into a single gene annotation file, we determined the differential expression analysis. By applying a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p-value, where significance was set to p <= 0.05, statistically significant differential expression was determined. Furthermore, pathway analysis was performed on transcript lists from both cell lines using GeneCoDis to identify the KEGG and Panther pathways that are significantly different between MOELOW and MOEHIGH cell lines. We find that the splicesome, RNA transport, the cell cycle, and DNA replication were the most highly upregulated pathway whereas the repressed pathways included processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, focal adhesion, and the lysosome. RNA sequencing revealed that p53 in MOELOW and MOEHIGH cells was not mutated; however, MOEHIGH cells had a significant upregulation of a splice variant of p53. The splice variant behaved like wild-type on few targets and missense on some transcriptional targets by qRT-PCR. This study provides a framework for the application of comprehensive chromatin profiling towards characterization of diverse mammalian cell populations. This model provides a framework to uncover a step-wise progression of tumor formation from an oviductal origin to be compared to human disease. Examination of altered molecular signaling pathways in 2 cell types.",

Exposure to ionizing radiation increases the risk of chronic metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes later in life. We hypothesized that irradiation reprograms the epigenome of metabolic progenitor cells, which could account for impaired metabolism after cancer treatment. C57Bl/6 mice were treated with a single dose of irradiation and subjected to high fat diet (HFD). RNA Sequencing and Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing were used to create transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles of preadipocytes and skeletal muscle satellite cells collected from irradiated mice. Mice subjected to total body irradiation showed alterations in glucose metabolism and, when challenged with HFD, marked hyperinsulinemia. Insulin signaling was chronically disrupted in skeletal muscle and adipose progenitor cells collected from irradiated mice and differentiated in culture. Epigenomic profiling of skeletal muscle and adipose progenitor cells from irradiated animals revealed substantial DNA methylation changes, notably for genes regulating the cell cycle, glucose/lipid metabolism and expression of epigenetic modifiers. Our results show that total body irradiation alters intracellular signaling and epigenetic pathways regulating cell proliferation and differentiation of skeletal muscle and adipose progenitor cells, and provide a possible mechanism by which irradiation used in cancer treatment increases the risk for metabolic disease later in life.

    "text": "Analysis of cardiac gene expression in juvenile versus mature mice with repressed CELF activity (MHC-CELFdelta). CUG-BP, Elav-like family (CELF) proteins regulate alternative splicing. In MHC-CELFdelta transgenic mice, CELF-mediated alternative splicing is disrupted in heart muscle via expression of a nuclear dominant negative CELF protein under an alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter. MHC-CELFdelta mice develop dilated cardiomyopathy and contractile dysfunction by 3 weeks of age, shortly after the transgene is activated and splicing defects appear. Cardiac function and heart size spontaneously recover with age in a low-expressing (mild) line of MHC-CELFdelta mice despite persistence of dominant negative protein expression and splicing defects, whereas there is no recovery in a higher-expressing (severe) line that also experiences early muscle death and fibrosis. In this study, we explored the basis for this functional recovery by comparing the gene expression profiles in the hearts of low- and high-expressing lines of MHC-CELFdelta mice to those of wild type littermates at 3 weeks (when cardiac dysfunction is maximal) and 24 weeks (when the low-expressing line has recovered) using microarrays. We found that differences in gene expression are greatly reduced in older animals from the low-expressing line, but were exacerbated in the high-expressing line. We did not find evidence of a new compensatory pathway being activated in the low-expressing line with age, and propose that recovery may occur due to developmental stage-specific compatibility of CELF-dependent splice variants with the changing cellular environment of cardiomyocytes. Microarray analysis was performed on total RNA extracted from whole hearts of female mice: three MHC-CELFdelta-10 (high-expressing line) and three MHC-CELFdelta-574 (low-expressing line) were collected at 3 weeks, and five MHC-CELFdelta-10 and five MHC-CELFdelta-574 were collected at 24 weeks.

Attempts to use atRA for breast cancer treatment without a stratification strategy have resulted in limited overall effectiveness. To identify biomarkers for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with atRA, we characterized the effects of atRA on the tumor growth of 13 TNBC cell lines. This resulted in a range of tumor growth effects that was not predictable based on the levels of retinoid signaling molecules and transcriptional responses that were mostly independent of retinoic acid response elements. Given the importance of DNA methylation in regulating gene expression, we hypothesized that differential DNA methylation could predict the response of TNBCs to atRA. We identified over 1400 CpG sites that were differentially methylated between atRA resistant and sensitive cell lines. These CpG sites predicted the response of four TNBC patient-derived xenografts to atRA treatment and we utilized these xenografts to refine the profile to 6 CpGs. We identify as many as 17% of TNBC patients who could benefit from atRA treatment. These data illustrate that differential DNA methylation of specific sites may predict the response of patient tumors to atRA treatment.This study characterizes the gene expression of 2 triple-negative patient-derived breast cancer xenografts.

Therapeutic strategies that combine MEK inhibitors with agents that target apoptotic pathways may be a promising therapeutic approach. We investigated combining MEK and MDM2 inhibitors as a potential treatment strategy for KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancers and colorectal carcinomas that harbor wild-type TP53. The combination of pimasertib (MEK inhibitor) + SAR405838 (MDM2 inhibitor) was synergistic and induced the expression of PUMA and BIM, led to apoptosis and growth inhibition in vitro, and tumor regression in vivo. Acquired resistance to the combination commonly resulted from the acquisition of TP53 mutations, conferring complete resistance to MDM2 inhibition. In contrast, resistant clones exhibited marked variability in sensitivity to MEK inhibition, which significantly impacted sensitivity to subsequent treatment with alternative MEK inhibitor-based combination therapies.

We assessed the testicular effects of the antiandrogen, flutamide (FM), in a rat 28-day toxicity study using doses of 0.2-30 mg/kg/day. Concerning molecular data, we observed differential gene expression starting from 1 mg/kg/day and a deregulation of more than 1500 genes at 30 mg/kg/day. Dose-related changes were identified for the major pathways associated with the testicular lesion (eg fatty acid metabolism), that were confirmed by qPCR.

Currently, there is no way to detect early diabetic nephropathy (EDN).Here we performed an unbiased assessment of gene-expression analysis of postmortem human kidneys using microarrays to identify candidate genes that may contribute to EDN. Postmortem biological samples (blood and kidney tissue) from non-diabetic and individuals with EDN were obtained from the National Disease Research Interchange (Philadelphia, PA). Except for obesity, there was no significant difference in any of the parameters between study groups. There were more obese individuals in the EDN group than among non-diabetic controls. All diabetic donors had type 2 diabetes. Diabetes status was defined as hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c) >6.5%. Proteinuria was identified by urine dipstick performed during the terminal hospital admission. These diagnoses were confirmed by careful review of pre- and postmortem clinical health records. There were stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria included: 1) donors be between 17 to 80 years of age, 2) diabetic status confirmed as noted above, and 3) postmortem time within 24h from cross-clamping in the operating room (OR); the only exception with respect to HgbA1c testing was if a donor had been prescribed and/or using glycemic agent(s) including but not limited to metformin and insulin, in which case repeat A1c testing was not mandatory. Exclusion criteria included active infection, malignancy, severe glomerulosclerosis as determined in frozen OR biopsy material, history of renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis at any time), and any known genetic renal condition such as polycystic kidney disease, etc. Pathologic staging of diabetic tissues was performed using the 2010 Renal Pathology Society classification system for diabetic kidney disease.9 From each postmortem nephrectomy sample more than 100 glomeruli were reviewed in tissue sections.

Resistance towards anti-angiogenic therapy (AAT) still represents a substantial clinical challenge. We report here that tumor-infiltrating mast cells (MC) are powerful mediators decreasing efficacy of AAT in mice and cancer patients. They act in a cell-extrinsic manner by secreting granzyme B, which liberates pro-angiogenic mediators from the extracellular matrix. In addition, MC also diminish efficacy of anti-angiogenic agents in a cell-autonomous way, which can be blocked by the mast cell degranulation inhibitor cromolyn. Our findings are relevant in humans because patients harboring higher numbers of MC in their tumors have an inferior outcome after anti-angiogenic treatment in the Gepar Quinto randomized Phase 3 clinical trial. Thus, MC-targeting might represent a novel promising approach to increase efficacy of AAT. Panc02 cells were injected subcutanously into the flanks of C57BL/6J mice.

We observed that TRAIL survivor cells were highly resistant to a subsequent treatment with TRAIL 24hr later but that this resistance disappeared following several days in culture. Resistance did not involve downregulation of TRAIL receptors and extended to death ligands that bind different classes of receptors: TRAIL survivors were transiently resistant to FasL and vice versa. Gene expression analysis revealed that NF-kB-mediated inflammatory genes were activated in transiently resistant survivor cells leading to an inflammatory phenotype, but resistance was mediated by an independent mechanism related to changes in signaling at the DISC. Periodic exposure to TRAIL sustained resistance, demonstrating a component of induced survival signaling leading to transient acquired resistance to TRAIL. Based on these results we propose that TRAIL treatment leads to a transient adaptation in survivor cells that can be sustained in cells exposed to long-term TRAIL treatments, leading to acquired resistance. Minimizing the impact of cell-to-cell variability on TRAIL-mediated killing will thus require appropriate spacing of stimuli as well as the use of additional agents that inhibit pro-survival pathways. RNA was collected from Control (untreated) MCF10A cells, Survivors of TRAIL treatment (Day 1), Reset cells (survivors on Day 7), and Repeat cells (Survivors treated with TRAIL on 2 subsequent days).RNA was also collected from Control and Survivor MCF10A cells expressing an IKB-super-repressor construct (Addgene, Plasmid 15291; Boehm et al., 2007), or treated with caspase inhibitors.Three biological experiments were performed (on different days) with 1-2 replicates of each sample collected for each experiment. The total number of samples was 31, on 4 IlluminaRef8 BeadChips (one sample was from an unrelated experiment and was not included). The number of total replicates for each treatment is as follows: Control (7); Survivors (6); Reset (3); Repeat (3); Control-IKB-super-repressor (2); Survivors-IKB-super-repressor (2); Control-zVADinhibitor (2); Survivors-zVADinhibitor (2); Control-IETDinhibitor (2); Survivors-IETDinhibitor (2).",

Here we generate a comprehensive transcriptional profile of the separate stages of spontaneous remyelination following focal demyelination in the rat CNS. White matter tracts in the rat caudal cerebellar peduncles were focally demyelinated using 0.1% ethidium bromide, the lesions were isolated using laser capture microdissection at 5, 14 and 28 days postlesion, followed by RNA extraction and Illumina beadarray analysis of differentially expressed transcripts. We found transcripts encoding retinoid acid receptor RXR-gamma is highly differentially expressed during remyelination, and that oligodendrocyte lineage cells express RXR-gamma in rat tissues undergoing remyelination and in active and remyelinated MS lesions. RXR-gamma knockdown by RNA interference or RXR-specific antagonists severely inhibit oligodendrocyte differentiation in culture. In RXR-gamma deficient mice, adult oligodendrocyte precursor cells efficiently repopulate lesions following demyelination, but display delayed differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes. Administration of the RXR agonist 9-cis-retinoic acid to demyelinated cerebellar slice cultures and to aged rats following demyelination results in more remyelinated axons. RXR-gamma is therefore a positive regulator of endogenous oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and remyelination, and may be a pharmacological target for CNS regenerative therapy. 9 Samples analysed, 3 different time points each with 3 biological replicates.",

Regulatory T (Treg) cells derived from the thymus (tTreg) and periphery (pTreg) play central and distinct roles in immunosuppression, but mechanisms governing the generation and activation of Treg subsets in vivo remain uncertain. Here, we report that mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) unexpectedly supports the homeostasis and functional activation of tTreg and pTreg cells. Further, mTOR signaling is crucial for programming activated Treg cell effector function to protect immune tolerance and tissue homeostasis. Treg-specific deletion of mTOR drives spontaneous TH2 responses and altered barrier tissue homeostasis, associated with reductions in both thymic derived effector Treg (eTreg) and pTreg cells. Mechanistically, mTOR acts downstream of antigenic signals to drive IRF4 expression and mitochondrial metabolism, and accordingly, disruption of mitochondrial metabolism severely impairs Treg cell suppressive function and their homeostasis in tissues. Collectively, our results demonstrate that mTOR coordinates transcriptional and metabolic programs in activated Treg subsets to mediate tissue homeostasis. We used microarrays to explore global gene expression profiles in unstimulated cTreg cells or cTreg cells activated in the presence or absence of mTOR inhibitors Torin 1 and PP242.

Two naturally occurring mutations (P467L, V290M) in the ligand binding domain of PPAR gamma have been described in humans that lead to severe insulin resistance and hypertension. Experimental evidence suggests that these mutant versions of PPAR gamma act in a dominant negative fashion. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying PPAR gamma action in the vasculature, we determined the global gene expression profile in primary aortic endothelial cells in response to endothelial cell specific expression of a dominant negative isoform of PPAR gamma (V290M). We generated transgenic mice specifically targeting expression of dominant negative human PPAR gamma to the endothelium using an endothelial-specific promoter (vascular endothelial cadherin or CDH5).

Furthermore, our data show that the Y65C mutation in PQBP1 results in a deficiency of (alternative) splicing and in major effects on several epigenetic markers.

Since the pioneer work of Allinen et al. suggested that during breast cancer progression striking changes occur in CD10+ stromal cells, we aimed to better characterize this cell population and its clinical relevance.Results: This 12-gene CD10+ stroma signature includes among others genes involved in matrix remodeling (MMP11, MMP13, COL10A1) and genes related to osteoblast differentiation (periostin). The co-culture experiments demonstrated all three CD10+ cell types contribute to the CD10+ stroma signature.Of interest, this signature demonstrated an important role in differentiating in situ from invasive breast cancer, in prognosis of the HER2+ subpopulation of breast cancer only, and potentially in non-response to chemotherapy for those patients.Conclusions: Our results highlight the importance of CD10+ cells in breast cancer prognosis and efficacy of chemotherapy, particularly within the HER2+ breast cancer disease. We developed a CD10+ stroma gene expression signature (using HG U133 Plus 2.0) based on the comparison of CD10 cells isolated from tumoral (n=28) and normal (n=3) breast tissue. We further characterized the CD10+ cells by co-culture experiments of representative breast cancer cell lines with the different CD10+ stromal cell types (fibroblasts, myoepithelial and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)). We then evaluated its clinical relevance in terms of in situ to invasive progression, invasive breast cancer prognosis and prediction of efficacy of chemotherapy using publicly available datasets.",

The product of the ecotropic virus integration site 1 (EVI1) gene, whose overexpression is associated with a poor prognosis in myeloid leukemias and some epithelial tumors, regulates gene transcription both through direct DNA binding and through modulation of the activity of other sequence specific transcription factors. Previous results from our laboratory have shown that EVI1 influenced transcription regulation in response to the myeloid differentiation inducing agent, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), in a dual manner: it enhanced ATRA induced transcription of the RARb gene, but repressed the ATRA induction of the EVI1 gene itself. In the present study, we asked whether EVI1 would modulate the ATRA regulation of a larger number of genes, as well as biological responses to this agent, in human myeloid cells. U937 and HL-60 cells ectopically expressing EVI1 through retroviral transduction were subjected to microarray based gene expression analysis, and to assays measuring cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. These experiments showed that EVI1 modulated the ATRA response of several dozens of genes, and in fact reinforced it in the vast majority of cases. A particularly strong synergy between EVI1 and ATRA was observed for GDF15, which codes for a member of the TGF-b superfamily of cytokines. In line with the gene expression results, EVI1 enhanced cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis in response to ATRA, and knockdown of GDF15 counteracted some of these effects. HL60 cells transduced with an EVI1 expression vector or empty vector as a control were treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or an equivalent amount of DMSO (solvent) for 24 h prior to gene expression microarray analysis. 3 biological replicates were performed.",

Therefore, we focused on the effect of high sugar consumption on hepatic transcriptional networks in normal and high fat-fed mice.

Functional investigation of 128 conserved MLL-fusion-interactors identified a specific role for the lysine methyltransferase SETD2 in MLL-leukemia. SETD2 loss caused growth arrest and differentiation of AML cells, and led to increased DNA damage.

Diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by fasting hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance. Laboratory and population studies have shown that inorganic arsenic (iAs) can impair these pathways. Other metals including cadmium (Cd) and manganese (Mn) have also been linked to diabetes phenotypes. MicroRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression, have emerged as potential drivers of metabolic dysfunction. MicroRNAs responsive to metal exposures in vitro have also been reported in independent studies to regulate insulin secretion in vivo. We hypothesize that microRNA dysregulation may associate with and possibly contribute to insulin secretion impairment upon exposure to iAs, Cd, or Mn. We exposed insulin secreting rat insulinoma cells to non-cytotoxic concentrations of iAs (1 uM), Cd (5 uM), and Mn (25 uM) for 24 h followed by small RNA sequencing to identify dysregulated microRNAs. RNA sequencing was then performed to further investigate changes in gene expression caused by iAs exposure. While all three metals significantly inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, high-throughput sequencing revealed distinct microRNA profiles specific to each exposure. One of the most significantly upregulated microRNAs post-iAs treatment is miR-146a (~ + 2-fold), which is known to be activated by nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) signaling. Accordingly, we found by RNA-seq analysis that genes upregulated by iAs exposure are enriched in the NF-kB signaling pathway and genes down-regulated by iAs exposure are enriched in miR-146a binding sites and are involved in regulating beta cell function. Notably, iAs exposure caused a significant decrease in the expression of Camk2a, a calcium-dependent protein kinase that regulates insulin secretion, has been implicated in type 2 diabetes, and is a likely target of miR-146a. Further studies are needed to elucidate potential interactions among NF-kB, miR-146a, and Camk2a in the context of iAs exposure.

We characterize two variant hES cell lines (v-hESC-1 and v-hESC-2) that express pluripotencymarkers at high levels and do not harbor chromosomal abnormalities by standard cytogenetic measures. We show that the two lines possess some features of neoplastic progression, including a high proliferative capacity, growth-factorindependence, a 9- to 20-fold increase in frequency of tumor initiating cells, niche independence and aberrant lineage specification, although they are not malignant.

[Activation of stellate cells by tumor conditioned medium]. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by extensive desmoplasia, which challenges the molecular analyses of bulk tumor samples. Here we FACS-purified epithelial cells from human PDAC and normal pancreas and derived their genome-wide transcriptome and DNA methylome landscapes. Clustering based on DNA methylation revealed two distinct PDAC groups displaying different methylation patterns at regions encoding repeat elements. Methylationlow tumors are characterized by higher expression of endogenous retroviral (ERV) transcripts and dsRNA sensors which leads to a cell intrinsic activation of an interferon signature (IFNsign). This results in a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment and poor patient outcome. Methylationlow/IFNsignhigh and Methylationhigh/IFNsignlow PDAC cells preserve lineage traits, respective of normal ductal or acinar pancreatic cells. Moreover, ductal-derived KrasG12D/Trp53-/- mouse PDACs show higher expression of IFNsign compared to acinar-derived counterparts. Collectively, our data point to two different origins and etiologies of human PDACs, with the aggressive Methylationlow/IFNsignhigh subtype potentially targetable by agents blocking intrinsic IFN-signaling.

While the microRNA pathway has an essential role in the expansion of ss-cell mass, the extent of its contribution is unclear. Here we show that miR-184 is silenced in the pancreatic islets of several insulin-resistant mouse models and in the islets of type-2 diabetic human subjects. Reduction of miR-184 promotes the expression of its target Argonaute2 (Ago2), a component of the microRNA-induced silencing complex. While over-expression of Ago2 increased ss-cell proliferation, conditional deletion decreased ss-cell number. Moreover, restored expression of miR-184 in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice decreased Ago2 and prevented compensatory ss-cell expansion. Loss of Ago2 expression during insulin resistance blocked ss-cell growth and relieved the regulation of miR-375-targeted genes including the growth suppressor Cadm1. This study identifies the regulation of Ago2 by miR-184 as an essential component of the compensatory response to promote proliferation during insulin resistance.

Recently, inflammation has gained acceptance as a crucial event in the pathogenesis and development of atherosclerosis. A number of studies have provided some insights into the relationships between the two aspects of atherosclerosis: plasma lipids --- the risk factors, and circulating leukocytes --- the effectors of inflammation. In this study, we investigate the relationships between plasma lipids and leukocytes.Methods and Results---No significant correlation was found between leukocyte counts and plasma lipid levels in 74 individuals. Profiling and analyzing the leukocyte gene expression of 32 individuals revealed distinctive patterns in response to plasma lipid levels: 1) genes involved in lipid metabolism and in the electron transport chain were positively correlated with triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels; 2) genes involved in platelet activation were negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels; 3) transcription factors regulating lipidgenesis-related genes were correlated with plasma lipid levels; 4) a number of genes correlated to plasma lipid levels were found located in the regions of known QTLs associated with hyperlipemia. Conclusions--- We discovered interesting patterns of leukocyte gene expression in response to plasma lipid levels. Most importantly, genes involved in lipid metabolism, the electron transportation chain, and platelet activation were found correlated with plasma lipid levels. We suggest that leukocytes respond to changing plasma lipid levels by regulating a network of genes, including genes involved in lipid and fatty acid metabolism, through the activation of key transcription factors, such as sterol regulatory element binding transcription factors and peroxisome proliferative activated receptors.Keywords: Atherosclerosis, leukocyte, lipid, gene expression. 1.

Removal of introns by pre-mRNA splicing is a critical and in some cases rate-limiting step in mammalian gene expression. Deep sequencing of mouse embryonic stem cell RNA revealed many specific internal introns that are significantly more abundant than the other introns within poly(A) selected transcripts; we classify these as \"detained\" introns (DIs). We identified thousands of DIs flanking both constitutive and alternatively spliced exons in human and mouse cell lines. Drug inhibition of Clk SR-protein kinase activity triggered rapid splicing changes in a specific set of DIs, about half of which showed increased splicing and half increased intron detention, altering the transcript pool of over 300 genes. These data suggest a widespread mechanism by which a nuclear detained pool of mostly processed pre-mRNAs can be rapidly mobilized in response to stress or homeostatic autoregulation. v6.5 mouse embryonic stem cells were untreated, treated with the Clk kinase inhibitor KH-CB19, or treated with DMSO as a negative control.

    "text": "Loss of Oncogenic Notch1 Contributes to PI3 Kinase Inhibitor Resistance in T Lineage Leukemia. Somatic NOTCH1 mutations are found in ~60% of T lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs). Notch1 is cleaved by g secretase to generate activated Notch intracellular domain (NICD) proteins. The NOTCH1 mutations found in T-ALL constitutively activate Notch1 signaling by increasing NICD levels. Genetic alterations in components of the Ras/PI3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway are also highly prevalent in T-ALL, and often coexist with NOTCH1 mutations. Exposing a T-ALL cell line to the PI3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor GDC-0941 generated drug resistant clones that down-regulated NICD expression. To address the in vivo relevance of this unexpected observation, we transplanted primary wild-type (WT) and KrasG12D mutant T-ALLs into recipient mice, and treated them with GDC-0941 alone and in combination with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (PD901). Although many leukemias responded dramatically to these targeted agents in vivo, drug-resistant clones invariably emerged. Multiple resistant T-ALLs lost NICD expression through mechanisms that included loss of Notch1 mutations found in the parental T-ALL. These GDC-0941-resistant leukemias exhibited reduced expression of many Notch1 target genes, elevated levels of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt), and displayed cross-resistance to g secretase inhibitors (GSIs). Consistent with these data, inhibiting Notch1 activity in T-ALL cells enhanced PI3K signaling, providing a likely mechanism for in vivo selection against clones with Notch1 pathway activation. Thus, oncogenic Notch1 mutations that promote clonal outgrowth during malignant transformation unexpectedly \"switch\" to become deleterious during treatment with a PI3K inhibitor. These data advance our understanding of T-ALL pathogenesis and have implications for implementing new therapeutic regimens. We analyzed 28 mouse T-ALL samples obtained after in vivo treatment with GDC-0941 alone or GDC-0941 + PD0325901. These T-ALL samples are either Kras wild type or harbor a KrasG12D mutations.",

FUS/TLS is an RNA/DNA-binding protein associated with neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Previously, we found that a prion-like domain in the N-terminus of FUS/TLS mediates co-aggregation between FUS/TLS and mutant huntingtin, the gene product of Huntington's disease (HD). Here, we show that heterozygous knockout of FUS/TLS worsened the phenotypes of model mice of Huntington's disease (HD) but not spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). This difference was correlated with the degree of pathological association between disease proteins and FUS/TLS. Co-aggregation between FUS/TLS and mutant huntingtin resulted in the depletion of free FUS/TLS protein in HD mice that was detected as a monomer in SDS-PAGE analysis. Recently, we found that FUS/TLS paralogs, TAF15 and EWS, were up-regulated in homozygous FUS/TLS knockout mice. These two proteins were up-regulated in both HD and FUS/TLS heterozygote mice, and were further elevated in HD-TLS+/- double mutant mice, consistent with the functional impairment of FUS/TLS. These results suggest that FUS/TLS sequestration by co-aggregation is a rate-limiting factor of disease phenotypes of HD and that inclusions may have an adverse aspect, rather than being simply benign or protective. In addition, our results highlight inclusions as repositories of potential modifiers of neurodegeneration.Gene expression profiles were analyzed to examine the effects of FUS/TLS heterozygosity in mouse with or without the transgene of mutant huntingtin exon 1. To examine the effect of FUS/TLS heterozygosity on the transcriptome of Huntington's disease model mice, we crossed FUS/TLS heterozygous knockout mice with HD model mice.

Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are emerging as key molecules in human cancer, with the potential to serve as novel markers of disease and to reveal uncharacterized aspects of tumor biology. Here we discover 121 unannotated prostate cancer-associated ncRNA transcripts (PCATs) by ab initio assembly of high-throughput sequencing of polyA+ RNA (RNA-Seq) from a cohort of 102 prostate tissues and cells lines. We characterized one ncRNA, PCAT-1, as a prostate-specific regulator of cell proliferation and show that it is a target of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). We further found that patterns of PCAT-1 and PRC2 expression stratified patient tissues into molecular subtypes distinguished by expression signatures of PCAT-1-repressed target genes. Taken together, our findings suggest that PCAT-1 is a transcriptional repressor implicated in a subset of prostate cancer patients. These findings establish the utility of RNA-Seq to identify disease-associated ncRNAs that may improve the stratification of cancer subtypes. 21 prostate cell lines sequenced on the Illumina Genome Analyzer and GAII.

Estrogens and progesterone control mammary gland development and breast carcinogenesis via their cognate receptors expressed in a subset of cells of the luminal layer of the mammary epithelium. The extracellular matrix (ECM) including the basement membrane (BM) is important in breast physiology and tumorigenesis but how epithelial hormone receptor signaling and ECM are linked mechanistically is unclear. We identify the secreted protease Adamts18 as critical intermediary. Luminal estrogen and progesterone receptor signaling via upregulation of Wnt4 expression and ensuing canonical Wnt signaling activation in basal cells control Adamts18 expression there. The protease has an epithelial-intrinsic role in stem cell activation. We identify multiple binding partners in the interstitial ECM and BM and show that ADAMTS18 cleaves fibronectin in vitro. Its deletion results in increased fibronectin, collagen I and IV, and laminin deposition in pubertal glands. Adamts18 interacts genetically with Col18a1, which encodes a proteoglycan that is BM-specific, in stem cell regulation. Adamts18 inactivation impairs Hippo signaling and reduces Fgfr2 expression and signaling, which are vital for stem cell function. Our findings link epithelial hormone signaling to BM remodeling by Adamts18, and define the BM as an essential stem cell niche component.

To identify novel therapeutic targets, elucidate its oncogenic activities and molecular mechanism in HCC is urgent. We used R language edgeR package screened the expression profiles of 374 tissue samples obtained from patients with HCC and 50 samples of normal liver tissues obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Focusing on DDX24, we explored the functional effect and clinical significance of DDX24 in HCC. We provided evidence that DDX24 was a potential pro-tumorigenic gene in HCC. DDX24 knockdown inhibited HCC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, RFX8 was proved to be DDX24 promoter-binding protein that transcriptionally upregulated DDX24 expression. Furthermore, we found that DDX24 bound to, and increased the stability of, LAMB1 mRNA by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) sequencing and RNA sequencing. Survival analysis indicated that HCC patients with high DDX24, RFX8, or LAMB1 expression exhibited poor prognosis. Our results demonstrated that DDX24 promoted HCC via RFX8/DDX24/LAMB1 pathway, which can be exploited as potential therapeutic target against HCC.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the accumulation of CD5+ B lymphocytes in peripheral blood, lymphoid organs and BM. The main feature of the disease is accumulation of the malignant cells due to decreased apoptosis. CD84 belongs to the Signaling Lymphocyte Activating Molecule (SLAM) family of immunoreceptors, and has an unknown function in CLL cells. Here, we show that the expression of CD84 is significantly elevated from the early stages of the disease, and is regulated by macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and its receptor, CD74. Activation of cell surface CD84 initiates a signaling cascade that enhances CLL cell survival. Both immune-mediated neutralization or blockade of CD84 induce cell death in vitro and in vivo. In addition, analysis of samples derived from an on-going clinical trial, in which human subjects were treated with humanized anti-CD74 milatuzumab shows a decrease in CD84 mRNA levels milatuzumab-treated cells. This downregulation was correlated with reduction of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 message. Thus, our data show that overexpression of CD84 in CLL is an important survival mechanism that appears to be an early event in the pathogenesis of the disease. These findings suggest novel therapeutic strategies based on the blockade of this CD84-dependent survival pathway. 3 samples; incubated with PBS, MIF, or IL-8.",

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), leukemia stem cells (LSCs) play a central role in disease progression and recurrence due to their intrinsic capacity for self-renewal and chemotherapy resistance. Whereas epigenetic regulation balances normal blood stem cell self-renewal and fate decisions, mutation and dysregulation of epigenetic modifiers are now considered fundamental to leukemia initiation and progression. Alterations in miRNA function represent a non-canonical epigenetic mechanism influencing malignant hematopoiesis; however, the function of miRNA in LSC remains undetermined. Here we show that miRNA profiling of fractionated AML populations defines an LSC-specific signature that is highly predictive of patient survival. Gain-of-function genetic analysis demonstrated that miR-126 restrained cell cycle progression, prevented LSC differentiation, and increased LSC self-renewal. miR-126 promoted chemo-resistance, preserving LSC quiescence in part through suppression of the G0-to-G1 gatekeeper, CDK3. Thus, in AML, miRNAs influence patient outcome through post-transcriptional regulation of stemness programs in LSC.

No significant loss of C9ORF72 expression was observed, and knockdown of the transcript was not toxic to cultured human motor neurons. Transcription of the repeat was increased, leading to accumulation of GGGGCC repeat-containing RNA foci selectively in C9-ALS iPSC-derived motor neurons. Repeat-containing RNA foci colocalized with hnRNPA1 and Pur-a, suggesting that they may be able to alter RNA metabolism. C9-ALS motor neurons showed altered expression of genes involved in membrane excitability including DPP6, and demonstrated a diminished capacity to fire continuous spikes upon depolarization compared to control motor neurons. Antisense oligonucleotides targeting the C9ORF72 transcript suppressed RNA foci formation and reversed gene expression alterations in C9-ALS motor neurons. These data show that patient-derived motor neurons can be used to delineate pathogenic events in ALS. Transcriptome profiling from iPSC derived motor neurons compared to controls.",

Neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are a remarkable tool for modeling human neural development and diseases. However, it remains largely unknown whether the hPSC-derived neurons can be functionally coupled with their target tissues in vitro, which is essential for understanding inter-cellular physiology and further translational studies. Here, we demonstrate that hPSC-derived sympathetic neurons can be obtained from hPSCs and that the resulting neurons form physical and functional connections with cardiac muscle cells. By use of multiple hPSC reporter lines, we recapitulated human autonomic neuron development in vitro, and successfully isolated PHOX2B::eGFP+ neurons exhibiting sympathetic marker expression, electrophysiological properties, and norepinephrine secretion. With pharmacological and optogenetic manipulations, the PHOX2B::eGFP+ neurons controlled the beating rates of cardiomyocytes, and their physical interaction led to neuronal maturation. Our study lays a foundation for the specification of human sympathetic neurons and for the hPSC-based neuronal control of end organs in a dish. Using the four genetic reporter systems (OCT4::eGFP, SOX10::eGFP, ASCL1::eGFP, and PHOX2B::eGFP reporter hESC lines), we were able to purify discrete cell populations at four differentiation stages, recapitulating the sympathoadrenal differentiation process in vitro with purified and defined populations in four specific differentiation stages. We performed transcriptome analysis of OCT4::eGFP+ cells (3 biological replicates, representing undifferentiated hESCs), SOX10::eGFP+ cells (3 biological replicates, multi-potent neural crest), ASCL1::eGFP+ cells (3 biological replicates, putative sympathoadrenal progenitors), and PHOX2B::eGFP+ cells (2 biological replicates, putative sympathetic neuronal precursors).",

Purpose: We aimed to examine whether eukaryotic cell lyophilization and long-term storage would be feasible as an environmentally friendly and cheap alternative to cryogenic storage or the use of FFPE samples for large-scale RNA profiling studies.Brief method: On three different days three million GM12873 cells were taken up in 0.1 M trehalose, subjected to lyophilization (freeze-drying) and then stored for two weeks at room temperature in the presence of CaCl2 in a dark, tightly sealed box. Fresh paired control cells were pelleted and taken up in trizol without lyophilization.

Chronic inflammation and proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 are considered tumor-promoting. In contrast, the exact nature of protective antitumor immunity remains obscure. In this study, we have quantified locally secreted cytokines during primary immune responses against myeloma and B-cell lymphoma in mice. Strikingly, successful cancer immunosurveillance mediated by tumor-specific CD4+ T cells was consistently associated with elevated local levels of both proinflammatory (IL-1aplha, IL-1beta, and IL-6) and T helper 1 (Th1)-associated cytokines (interferon-alpha, IL-2, IL-12).

Brain gene expression profiling studies of suicide and depression using oligonucleotide microarrays have often failed to distinguish these two phenotypes. Moreover, next generation sequencing approaches are more accurate in quantifying gene expression and can detect alternative splicing. Using RNA-seq, we examined whole-exome gene and exon expression in non-psychiatric controls (CON, N=29), DSM-IV major depressive disorder suicides (MDD-S, N=21) and MDD non-suicides (MDD, N=9) in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann Area 9) of sudden death medication-free individuals post mortem. Using small RNA-seq, we also examined miRNA expression (nine samples per group). DeSeq2 identified 35 genes differentially expressed between groups and surviving adjustment for false discovery rate (adjusted P<0.1). In depression, altered genes include humanin-like-8 (MTRNRL8), interleukin-8 (IL8), and serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade H (SERPINH1) and chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4), while exploratory gene ontology (GO) analyses revealed lower expression of immune-related pathways such as chemokine receptor activity, chemotaxis and cytokine biosynthesis, and angiogenesis and vascular development in (adjusted P<0.1). Hypothesis-driven GO analysis suggests lower expression of genes involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation, regulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission, and oxytocin receptor expression in both suicide and depression, and provisional evidence for altered DNA-dependent ATPase expression in suicide only. DEXSEq analysis identified differential exon usage in ATPase, class II, type 9B (adjusted P<0.1) in depression. Differences in miRNA expression or structural gene variants were not detected.

We investigated the role of chemokines in regulating T-cell accumulation in solid tumors. CCL5 and CXCL9 overexpression was associated with CD8+ T-cell infiltration in common solid tumors. T-cell infiltration required tumor cell-derived CCL5 and was amplified by IFN-dependent, myeloid cell-secreted CXCL9. Accordingly, CCL5-CXCL9 co-expression revealed immunoreactive tumors with prolonged survival and response to checkpoint blockade. Loss of CCL5 expression in human tumors was associated with epigenetic silencing through DNA methylation. Reduction of CCL5 expression caused TIL desertification whereas forced CCL5 expression prevented Cxcl9 and TIL loss and attenuated tumor growth in mice through IFN. The cooperation between tumor-derived CCL5 and IFN-inducible CXCR3 ligands secreted by myeloid cells is key for orchestrating T-cell infiltration in immunoreactive and immunoresponsive tumors.

    "text": "Runx2 Transcriptome of Prostate Cancer Cells: Insights into Invasiveness and Bone Metastasis. Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) cells preferentially metastasize to bone at least in part by acquiring osteomimetic properties. Runx2, an osteoblast master transcription factor, is aberrantly expressed in PCa cells, and promotes their metastatic phenotype. The transcriptional programs regulated by Runx2 have been extensively studied during osteoblastogenesis, where it activates or represses target genes in a context-dependent manner. However, little is known about the gene regulatory networks influenced by Runx2 in PCa cells. We therefore investigated genome-wide mRNA expression changes in PCa cells in response to Runx2.Results: We engineered a C4-2B PCa sub-line called C4-2B/Rx2dox, in which doxycycline (Dox) treatment stimulates Runx2 expression from very low levels to levels observed in other PCa cells. Transcriptome profiling using whole genome expression array followed by in silico analysis indicated that Runx2 upregulated a multitude of genes with prominent cancer-associated functions. They included secreted factors (CSF2, SDF-1), proteolytic enzymes (MMP9, CST7), cytoskeleton modulators (SDC2, Twinfilin, SH3PXD2A), intracellular signaling molecules (DUSP1, SPHK1, RASD1) and transcription factors (Sox9, SNAI2, SMAD3) functioning in epithelium to mesenchyme transition (EMT), tissue invasion, as well as homing and attachment to bone. Consistent with the gene expression data, induction of Runx2 in C4-2B cells enhanced their invasiveness. It also promoted cellular quiescence by blocking the G1/S phase transition during cell cycle progression. Furthermore, the cell cycle block was reversed as Runx2 levels declined after Dox withdrawal.Conclusions: The effects of Runx2 in C4-2B/Rx2dox cells, as well as similar observations made by employing LNCaP, 22RV1 and PC3 cells, highlight multiple mechanisms by which Runx2 promotes the metastatic phenotype of PCa cells, including tissue invasion, homing to bone and induction of high bone turnover. Runx2 is therefore an attractive target for the development of novel diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches to PCa management. Targeting Runx2 may prove more effective than focusing on its individual downstream genes and pathways. C4-2B/Rx2dox cells were subjected to microarray gene expression analysis after one and two days of treatment with either Dox or vehicle in biological quadruplicates (a total of 16 samples).",

Purpose: WNT signaling activation in colorectal cancers (CRCs) occurs mainly through APC inactivation or, more uncommonly, b-catenin activation. Both processes promote b-catenin nuclear accumulation, which transcriptionally up-regulates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes. Experimental Design: We investigated b-catenin localization, downstream gene expression, and phenotypic alterations in HCT116 cells containing a wild-type (HCT116-WT) or mutant b-catenin allele (HCT116-MT), or parental cells with both WT and mutant alleles (HCT116-P). We then analyzed b-catenin localization and associated phenotypes in CRC tissues. Results: Wild-type b-catenin mainly localized at the cell membrane, whereas mutant showed predominantly nuclear localization; membranous, cytoplasmic, and nuclear localization was observed in HCT116-P cells. Microarray analysis revealed significant down-regulation of Claudin-7 and E-cadherin in HCT116-MT vs. HCT116-WT cells. Claudin-7 was also down-regulated in HCT116-P vs. HCT116-WT cells, although E-cadherin expression was unaffected. Altered expression of cell-cell junction-related molecules led to tight junction (TJ) impairment in HCT116-P, and dual loss of TJs and adherens junctions (AJs) in HCT116-MT. TJ loss increased migration and invasion activities of HCT116-WT, whereas AJ loss was required to further up-regulate these activities in HCT116-P. Immunohistochemistry analysis of 101 stage III CRC tissues revealed high nuclear b-catenin expression (>=30% of tumor cells) in 15 (14.9%) samples, low nuclear expression (1-29%) in 53 (52.5%) samples, and undetectable nuclear expression in 33 (32.6%) samples, with a trend toward more frequent down-regulation of Claudin-7 and E-cadherin, and increased metastasis in CRCs with high vs. low nuclear b-catenin. Conclusions: b-catenin activation and nuclear translocation induce EMT progression by modifying cell-cell junctions, and are associated with aggressive behaviors of CRCs.

We show that YAP functions as a rheostat maintaining metabolic specialization, differentiation and quiescence within the hepatocyte compartment. Importantly, treatment with siRNA-lipid nanoparticles (siRNA-LNPs) targeting YAP restores hepatocyte differentiation and causes pronounced tumor regression in a genetically engineered mouse HCC model (mice with liver-specific Mst1/Mst2 double knockout). Furthermore, YAP targets are enriched in an aggressive human HCC subtype characterized by a proliferative signature and absence of CTNNB1 mutations. Thus, our work reveals Hippo signaling as a key regulator of positional identity of hepatocytes, supports targeting YAP using siRNA-LNPs as a paradigm of differentiation-based therapy, and identifies an HCC subtype potentially responsive to this approach.

Up to 41% of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) result from activating mutations in the CTNNB1 gene encoding b-catenin. b-catenin has dual cellular functions as a component of the Wnt signaling pathway and adherens junctions. HCC-associated CTNNB1 mutations stabilize the b-catenin protein, leading to nuclear and/or cytoplasmic localization of b-catenin and downstream activation of Wnt target genes. In patient HCC samples, b-catenin nuclear and cytoplasmic localization are typically patchy, even among HCC with highly active CTNNB1 mutations. The functional and clinical relevance of this heterogeneity in b-catenin activation are not well understood. To define mechanisms of b-catenin-driven HCC initiation, we generated a Cre-lox system that enabled switching on activated b-catenin in 1) a small number of hepatocytes in early development; or 2) the majority of hepatocytes in later development or adulthood. We discovered that switching on activated b-catenin in a subset of larval hepatocytes was sufficient to drive HCC initiation. To determine the role of Wnt/b-catenin signaling heterogeneity later in hepatocarcinogenesis, we performed RNA-seq analysis of zebrafish b-catenin-driven HCC. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of differentially expressed genes in the Cre-lox HCC model revealed that \"Cancer\" and \"Liver Tumor\" categories were significantly altered, indicating transcriptional similarities with human HCC and other vertebrate HCC models. At the single-cell level, 2.9% to 15.2% of hepatocytes from zebrafish b-catenin-driven HCC expressed two or more of the Wnt target genes axin2, mtor, glula, myca, and wif1, indicating focal activation of Wnt signaling in established tumors. Thus, heterogeneous b-catenin activation drives HCC initiation and persists throughout hepatocarcinogenesis.

FXS is due to the absence of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein mainly involved in translational control. Even if this molecular defect is known, no specific therapy is available for FXS. The first alteration observed in the brain of FXS patients and of Fmr1 KO mice, model for FXS, is represented by an abnormal dendritic morphology that is associated with an altered synaptic plasticity. These findings led to numerous studies focused on mature neurons. However, recently, an increasing body of evidence is pointing out the importance of FMRP in the early steps of brain development. Thus, with the purpose to decipher the earliest molecular events leading to FXS we developed a stem-cell-based disease model by knocking-down the expression of Fmr1 in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. To gain insights in the pathways that are affected when FMRP is repressed, we performed a gene expression profile analysis comparing total RNA from shFmr1 and shControl ES cells using whole genome mouse microarrays. Transcripts were clustered according to their Gene Ontology classification using the DAVID software. Surprisingly, the most altered functional category was Nervous system development and function, highlighting the role of FMRP also during the earliest steps of neural development. To study the precise role of FMRP in Embryonic stem (ES) cells, we used an RNAi-based loss-of-function strategy by transducing mouse ES cells with a lentivirus expressing GFP and a shRNA targeting the constitutive exon 1 of Fmr1 (shFmr1). A random shRNA (shCT) was used as a control sequence. Transduced cells were sorted by flow cytometry and established as non-clonal cell populations.

While the high mtDNA heteroplasmy exceeding a critical threshold causes mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis with stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome, the low mtDNA heteroplasmy causes maternally inherited diabetes with or without deafness (MIDD) syndrome. How quantitative differences in mtDNA heteroplasmy produces distinct pathological states has remained elusive. Here we show that despite striking similarities in the energy metabolic gene expression signature, the mitochondrial bioenergetics, biogenesis and fuel catabolic functions are distinct in cells harboring low or high levels of the m.3243A>G mutation compared to wild type cells. We further demonstrate that the low heteroplasmic mutant cells exhibit a coordinate induction of transcriptional regulators of the mitochondrial biogenesis, glucose and fatty acid metabolism pathways that lack in near homoplasmic mutant cells compared to wild type cells. Altogether, these results shed new biological insights on the potential mechanisms by which low mtDNA heteroplasmy may progressively cause diabetes mellitus.

The intestine harbors all ILC subsets; however, how these cells orchestrate each other to achieve immune homeostasis and mount appropriate immunity during infection remains elusive. Here, we show that the adaptation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) expression in the gut is a key regulatory mode for the host to keep the ILC balance. Among ILCs, Ahr is most highly expressed by gut ILC2, and controls in a positive feedback manner, chromatin accessibility at the Ahr gene locus. Ahr suppresses Gfi1-mediated ST2 expression in ILC2 and expression of ILC2 effector molecules IL-5, IL-13 and amphiregulin in a cell-intrinsic manner. Ablation of Ahr enhances anti-helminth immunity in the gut, while genetic or pharmacological activation of Ahr suppresses ILC2 but enhances ILC3 to protect the host from Citrobacter rodentium infection. Thus, the host regulates the gut ILC2-ILC3 balance by engaging the Ahr pathway to mount appropriate immunity against various pathogens.

The cure rate for late stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) has not significantly improved over several decades. New and more effective targets and treatment modalities are urgently needed.

Bioinformatics analyses of the RNA-seq data and biological signaling and function studies have identified new targets, such as ZIP4 in EOC. Many up-regulated tumor promoting signaling pathways have been identified which are mainly grouped into three cellular activities: 1) cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance; 2) cell skeleton and adhesion changes; and 3) carbohydrate metabolic reprogramming. Unexpectedly, lipid metabolism has been the major down-regulated signaling pathway in the more aggressive EOC cells. In addition, we found that hypoxic responsive genes were at the center stage of regulation and detected functional changes were related to cancer stem cell-like activities.

Despite decades of clinical use, mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance are poorly understood. We treated primary murine T lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs) with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) alone and in combination with the pan-PI3 kinase inhibitor GDC-0941 and observed a robust response to DEX that was modestly enhanced by GDC-0941. Continuous in vivo treatment invariably resulted in outgrowth of drug-resistant clones, ~30% of which showed markedly reduced glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein expression. A similar proportion of relapsed human T-ALLs also exhibited low GR protein levels. De novo or pre-existing mutations in the gene encoding GR (Nr3c1) occurred in relapsed clones derived from multiple independent parental leukemias. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing confirmed that loss of GR expression confers DEX resistance. Exposing drug-sensitive T-ALLs to DEX in vivo altered transcript levels of multiple genes, and this response was attenuated in relapsed T-ALLs. These data implicate reduced GR protein expression as a frequent cause of glucocorticoid resistance in T-ALL.

The primary function of RUNX1 in leukemogenesis has been controversial since classical understanding of RUNX1 as an oncosuppressor was challenged by our recent discovery of novel oncogenic features of RUNX1. Here we provide insight into the dual function of RUNX1 through determining the significance of total RUNX expressions in AML cells. Our data indicate that moderately attenuated RUNX1 expression induces increased total RUNX expressions, which subsequently enhances proliferation of AML cells via GSTA2-mediated intracellular ROS removal. Indeed, inhibiting GSTA2 function in vivo prolonged the overall survival period of mice xeno-transplanted with human AML cells. These findings suggest that modulation of RUNX-GST-ROS axis could potentially be a novel therapeutic target in the poorest-prognostic AML patients with intermediate RUNX1 expression levels. MV4-11 cells were transduced with series of shRNAs targeting RUNX1 at various efficacies (Moderate knockdown; MV4-11_sh_Rx1_moderate, Profound knockdown; MV4-11_sh_Rx1_profound_#1 and #2).

Hematopoietic stem cells are both necessary and sufficient to sustain the complete blood system of vertebrates. Here we show that Nfix, a member of the nuclear factor I (Nfi) family of transcription factors, is highly expressed by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) of murine adult bone marrow. Although shRNA mediated knockdown of Nfix expression in Lineage-Sca-1+c-Kit+ HSPC had no effect on in vitro cell growth or viability, Nfix-depleted HSPC displayed a significant loss of colony forming potential, as well as short- and long-term in vivo hematopoietic repopulating activity. Analysis of recipient mice 4-20 days post-transplant revealed that Nfix-depleted HSPC establish in the bone marrow but fail to persist due to increased apoptotic cell death. Gene expression profiling of Nfix-depleted HSPC reveals that loss of Nfix expression in HSPC is concomitant with a decrease in the expression of multiple genes known to be important for HSPC survival, such as Erg, Mecom, Mpl and Prdm16. These data reveal that Nfix is a novel regulator of HSPC survival post-transplantation and establish, for the first time, a role for Nfi genes in the regulation of this cellular compartment. 3 NFIX depleted samples are compared to 3 wt samples.",

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous malignancy, characterized by a variable clinical course. While clinical and laboratory parameters are increasingly being used to refine prognosis, they do not accurately predict response to commonly used therapy. We used gene expression profiling to generate and further refine prognostic and predictive markers. Genomic signatures that reflect progressive disease and responses to chemotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy were created using cancer cell lines and patient leukemia samples. We validated these signatures using independent clinical data from four separate cohorts representing a total of 301 CLL patients. A prognostic genomic signature created from patient leukemic cell gene expression data coupled with clinical parameters could statistically differentiate patients with stable or progressive disease in the training dataset. The progression signature was then validated in two independent datasets, demonstrating a capacity to accurately identify patients at risk for progressive disease. In addition, two distinct genomic signatures that predict response to chlorambucil or pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab were also generated and were shown to accurately distinguish responding and non-responding CLL patients. Microarray analysis of CLL patients' lymphocytes can be used to refine prognosis and predict response to different therapies. These results have direct implications for standard and investigational therapeutics in CLL patients.Keywords: Gene Expression Profiling of two phenotypic states.

Cancer is a disease of aging, and incidence and mortality from all cancers increase logarithmically after the age of 45. Older patients have a much poorer prognosis for melanomas of equal stage, compared to younger individuals. The role of the tumor microenvironment in modulating cancer behavior is widely recognized. We hypothesized that age-related changes in the tumor microenvironment could affect the progression of melanoma. We demonstrate that the aging microenvironment increases the invasion of melanoma cells. Using skin fibroblasts isolated from healthy donors, we have built artificial skin and demonstrate that melanoma cells invade more rapidly when exposed to aged fibroblasts. In a mouse model of melanoma (YUMM1.7, BrafV600E/Cdkn2a-/-/Pten-/-), congeneic to C57/BL6 mice, melanomas invade faster in aged mice. Gene expression analyses suggest that melanoma cells are undergoing DNA damage when exposed to an aged microenvironment, and we confirm this in cellular assays. Proteomics analysis of aging fibroblasts suggest that fibroblasts secrete molecules (laminin b2, Wnt inhibitors) associated with increased resistance to targeted therapy. Indeed, melanoma cells injected into aged mice respond less well to PLX4720 than those injected into young mice. This suggests that exciting new drugs targeting the BRAF pathway may be less effective in aging patients. To assess the effects of the aging microenvironment on melanoma cell gene expression, we co-cultured dermal fibroblasts from young (<35 years), medium or aged ( >55 years) individuals with three different melanoma cell lines (UACC1273, M93-047 and UACC903) in triplicate using transwell chambers.

The conditions of the tumor microenvironment, such as hypoxia and nutrient starvation, play critical roles in cancer progression. However, the role of acidic extracellular pH in cancer progression is not studied as extensively as that of hypoxia. Here, we show that extracellular acidic pH (pH 6.8) triggered activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) by stimulating nuclear translocation and promoter binding to its targets along with intracellular acidification. Interestingly, inhibition of SREBP2, but not SREBP1, suppressed the upregulation of low pH-induced cholesterol biosynthesis-related genes. Moreover, acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2), a direct SREBP2 target, provided a growth advantage to cancer cells under acidic pH. Furthermore, acidic pH-responsive SREBP2 target genes were associated with reduced overall survival of cancer patients. Thus, our findings show that SREBP2 is a key transcriptional regulator of metabolic genes and progression of cancer cells, partly in response to extracellular acidification. Cells were treated for 24 h under each condition. RNA-seq reads were aligned to human transcriptome (UCSC gene) and genome (GRCh37/hg19) references respectively using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner. After transcript coordinate was converted to genomic positions, an optimal mapping result was selected either from transcript or genome mapping by comparing the minimal edit distance to the reference.

Endometrial biopsy samples were obtained from subjects with and without mild peritoneal endometriosis (n = 4 per group), and hESFs were isolated and treated with P4 (1 mM) plus estradiol (E2) (10 nM), E2 alone (10 nM), or vehicle for up to 14 days. Total RNA was subjected to microarray analysis using a Gene 1.0 ST (Affymetrix) platform and analyzed by using bioinformatic algorithms, and data were validated by quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA. Results revealed unique kinetic expression of specific genes and unique pathways, distinct biological and molecular processes, and signaling pathways and networks during the early, intermediate, and late responses to P4 in both hESFnonendo and hESFendo, although a blunted response to P4 was observed in the latter. The normal response of hESF to P4 involves a tightly regulated kinetic cascade involving key components in the P4 receptor and MAPK signaling pathways that results in inhibition of E2-mediated proliferation and eventual differentiation to the decidual phenotype, but this was not established in the hESFendo early response to P4. The abnormal response of this cell type to P4 may contribute to compromised embryonic implantation and infertility in women with endometriosis. We compared early (6-h), intermediate (48-h), and late (14-day) in vitro whole-genome responses of hESF from women with endometriosis (hESFendo) to hESF from women without endometriosis (hESFnonendo) treated with P4 plus E2 (E2P4), E2 alone, or vehicle alone.

The pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is maintained by a small group of master transcription factors including Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog. These core factors form a regulatory circuit controlling the transcription of a number of pluripotency factors including themselves. Although a lot of previous studies have identified key factors regulating this core network in trans, the contribution of cis-regulatory DNA sequences on the transcription of these key pluripotency factors remains elusive. We analyzed epigenomic data within the 1.5 Mb gene-desert regions around Sox2 gene and predicted only one 13kb-long enhancer located 100kb downstream of Sox2 in mouse ES cells. This enhancer is occupied by Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and mediator complex and forms a long-range DNA looping to Sox2 locus. We hypothesized that this enhancer is critical for Sox2 gene expression and tested this hypothesis by deleting this entire 13-kb enhancer with a simple highly-efficient double-excision CRISPR strategy. Allele-specific of Sox2 transcripts in heterozygous enhancer-deletion clones showed that the enhancer affects expression through a cis-acting mechanism. Strikingly, although this distal enhancer is not conserved in other mammals including human, it is responsible for over 90% of Sox2 expression in mouse ESCs. Taken together, our results provide direct evidence that in mouse ESCs, Sox2 transcription is primarily driven by a species-specific distal enhancer, which may provide new perspectives explaining the physiological difference between human and mouse ES cells.

Conventional DNase sequencing (DNase-seq) for genome-wide DHSs profiling is limited by the requirement of millions of cells4, 5. Here we report an ultrasensitive strategy, called single-cell DNase sequencing (scDNase-seq) for detection of genome-wide DHSs in single cells. We show that DHS patterns at the single-cell level are highly reproducible among individual cells. Among different single cells, highly expressed gene promoters and enhancers associated with multiple active histone modifications display constitutive DHS whereas chromatin regions with fewer histone modifications exhibit high variation of DHS. Furthermore, the single-cell DHSs predict enhancers that regulate cell-specific gene expression programs and the cell-to-cell variations of DHS are predictive of gene expression. Finally, we apply scDNase-seq to pools of tumour cells and pools of normal cells, dissected from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue slides from patients with thyroid cancer, and detect thousands of tumour-specific DHSs. Many of these DHSs are associated with promoters and enhancers critically involved in cancer development. Analysis of the DHS sequences uncovers one mutation (chr18: 52417839G>C) in the tumour cells of a patient with follicular thyroid carcinoma, which affects the binding of the tumour suppressor protein p53 and correlates with decreased expression of its target gene TXNL1.

Here, we show that a p53-regulated lncRNA which we named PINCR (p53-induced noncoding RNA), is induced ~100-fold after DNA damage and exerts a critical prosurvival function in colorectal cancer cells (CRC) in vitro and tumor growth in vivo.

    "text": "Stepwise development of hematopoietic stem cells from embryonic stem cells. The cellular ontogeny of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remains poorly understood because their isolation from and their identification in early developing small embryos are difficult. We attempted to dissect early developmental stages of HSCs using an in vitro mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation system combined with inducible HOXB4 expression. Here we report the identification of pre-HSCs and an embryonic type of HSCs (embryonic HSCs) as intermediate cells between ESCs and HSCs. Both pre-HSCs and embryonic HSCs were isolated by their c-Kit+CD41+CD45- phenotype. Pre-HSCs did not engraft in irradiated adult mice. After co-culture with OP9 stromal cells and conditional expression of HOXB4, pre-HSCs gave rise to embryonic HSCs capable of engraftment and long-term reconstitution in irradiated adult mice. Blast colony assays revealed that most hemangioblast activity was detected apart from the pre-HSC population, implying the early divergence of pre-HSCs from hemangioblasts. Gene expression profiling suggests that a particular set of transcripts closely associated with adult HSCs is involved in the transition of pre-HSC to embryonic HSCs. Experimental strategy consisted of EB formation, co-culture with OP9 cells, and functional assays. iHOXB4 ESCs were allowed to differentiate spontaneously into EBs for 6 days without HOXB4 expression. We decided to fractionate EB6 cells mainly because by day 6 of culture the number of multipotent progenitors reaches a plateau and several surface markers become detectable. CD41 is known as a marker for the initiation of definitive hematopoiesis. CD41 appeared in a significant proportion of EB cells on day 6 of culture. Induced HOXB4 expression during EB formation did not affect the generation of colony forming cells and repopulating cells in the OP9 and iHOXB4 system or the appearance of surface markers in EB cells. EB6 cells were analyzed and sorted by flow cytometry. Sorted EB6 cells were co-cultured with OP9 cells for various days under HOXB4-on or -off conditions. The minimal requirement of the co-culture period appeared to be only 4 days, which is much shorter than previously thought. After a second analysis and fractionation by flow cytometry, cells were subjected to in vivo repopulating assays under HOXB4-on or -off conditions.",

Large-scale gene expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients could provide a molecular description that reflects the contribution of diverse cellular responses associated with this disease. The aim of our study is to identify peripheral blood gene expression profiles for RA patients, using Illumina technology, to gain insights into RA molecular mechanisms. The Illumina Human-6v2 Expression BeadChips were used for a complete genome-wide transcript profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 18 RA patients and 15 Controls. Differential analysis per gene was performed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and P values were adjusted to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR<5%). Genes differentially expressed at significant level between patients and controls were analyzed using Gene Ontology (GO) in the PANTHER database to identify biological processes. A differentially expression of 339 Reference Sequence genes (238 down-regulated and 101 up-regulated) between the two groups was observed. We identified a remarkably elevated expression of a spectrum of genes involved in Immunity and Defense in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of RA patients compared to Controls. This result is confirmed by GO analysis, suggesting that these genes could be activated systemically in RA. No significant down-regulated ontology groups were found. Microarrays data were validated by real time PCR in a set of nine genes showing a high degree of correlation. Our study highlighted several new genes that could contribute in the identification of innovative clinical biomarkers for diagnostic procedures and therapeutic intervention.

We observe LIN28 expression in the developing neural tube, colocalizing with SOX2, suggesting a role in neural development. To better understand its normal developmental function, we investigated LIN28 activity during neurogliogenesis in vitro where the succession of neuronal to glial cell fates occurs as it does in vivo. LIN28 expression was high in undifferentiated cells, and was down-regulated rapidly upon differentiation. Constitutive LIN28 expression caused a complete block of gliogenesis and an increase in neurogenesis. LIN28 expression was compatible with neuronal differentiation and did not increase proliferation. LIN28 caused significant changes in gene expression prior to any effect on let-7, notably on Igf2. Furthermore, a mutant LIN28 that permitted let-7 accumulation was still able to completely block gliogenesis. Thus, at least two biological activities of LIN28 are genetically separable and may involve distinct mechanisms. LIN28 can differentially promote and inhibit specific fates and does not function exclusively by blocking let-7 family miRNAs. Importantly, LIN28's role in cell fate succession in vertebrate cells is analogous to its activity as a developmental timing regulator in C. elegans.

Scope: Consumption of industrial trans fatty acids unfavourably alters plasma cholesterol and has been linked to NAFLD. However, the mechanisms underlying these deleterious effects of trans fatty acids are unclear. Here, we aim to investigate the molecular mechanisms of action of industrial trans fatty acids. Methods & Results: Hepa1-6 hepatoma cells were incubated with elaidate, oleate, or palmitate. C57Bl/6 mice were fed diets rich in trans-unsaturated, cis-unsaturated or saturated fatty acids. Transcriptomics analysis of Hepa1-6 cells showed that elaidate but not oleate or palmitate induced expression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. Induction of cholesterogenesis by elaidate was mediated by increased SREBP2 and dependent on SCAP, yet independent of LXR and UBXD8. Elaidate decreased intracellular free cholesterol levels and repressed the anti-cholesterogenic effect of exogenous cholesterol. In mice, the trans-unsaturated diet increased the ratio of liver to gonadal fat mass, steatosis, hepatic cholesterol levels, ALT activity, and fibrosis markers, suggesting enhanced NAFLD, compared to the cis-unsaturated and saturated diets. Conclusion: Elaidate induces cholesterogenesis in vitro via activation of the SCAP-SREBP axis, likely by lowering intracellular free cholesterol and attenuating cholesterol-dependent repression of SCAP. This pathway potentially underlies the increase in liver cholesterol and NAFLD by industrial trans fatty acids. 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were incubated with 3 different fatty acids and control for 24hrs, whereafter gene expression profiling was performed.",

    "text": "Increased Cell Surface Fas Expression is Necessary to Sensitize Lung Fibroblasts to Fas Ligation-Induced Apoptosis: Implications for Fibroblast Accumulation in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is associated with the accumulation of collagen-secreting fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in the lung parenchyma. Many mechanisms contribute to their accumulation, including resistance to apoptosis. In previous work, we showed that exposure to the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-a and IFN-g reverses fibroblast resistance to apoptosis. The goal of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanism. Based on an initial interrogation of the transcriptomes of unstimulated and TNF-a and IFN-g-stimulated primary lung fibroblasts and the lung fibroblast cell line, MRC5, we show here that among Fas-signaling pathway molecules, Fas expression was increased ~6-fold in an NF-kB and p38mapk-dependent fashion. Prevention of the increase in Fas expression using Fas siRNAs blocked the ability of TNF-a and IFN-g to sensitize fibroblasts to Fas ligation induced-apoptosis; while enforced adenovirus-mediated Fas overexpression was sufficient to overcome basal resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis. Examination of lung tissues from IPF patients revealed low to absent staining of Fas in fibroblastic cells of fibroblast foci. Collectively, these findings suggest that increased expression of Fas is necessary and sufficient to overcome the resistance of lung fibroblasts to Fas-induced apoptosis. They also suggest that approaches aimed at increasing Fas expression by lung fibroblasts and myofibroblasts may be therapeutically relevant. To investigate the mechanism by which TNF-a and IFN-g reprogram fibroblasts from resistance to sensitivity to Fas-ligation-induce apoptosis, we exposed human primary lung fibroblasts from an IPF patient (FS087) and non-disease control subject (N78) and the human fetal lung fibroblast cell lung (MRC-5) to TNF-a (10 ng/ml) and IFN-g (50 U/ml) for 36 hr and analyzed changes in their transcriptomes using Affymetrix microarrays.",

Adult pancreatic b cells are refractory to proliferation, a roadblock for the treatment of insulin-deficient diabetes. Consumption of energy-dense Western or high-fat diet (HFD) triggers mild adaptive b cell mass expansion to compensate for peripheral insulin resistance; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here we show that Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2/TLR4 act as molecular \"brakes\" for diet-induced b cell replication in both mice and humans. The combined loss of TLR2/TLR4, but not individually, dramatically increases facultative b, not a, cell replication, leading to progressively enlarged islet mass and hyperinsulinemia in diet-induced obesity. Mechanistically, loss of TLR2/TLR4 increases b cell proliferation and nuclear abundance of Cyclin D2 and CDK4 in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent manner. These data reveal a novel mechanism governing adaptive b cell mass expansion in diet-induced obesity and suggest that selective targeting of TLR2/TLR4 pathways may hold promise for reversing b cell failure in diabetic patients.

Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a highly aggressive brain tumour that is located in the pons and primarily affects children. Whole-exome sequencing studies have identified recurrent driver mutations in H3F3A and HIST1H3B, leading to the expression of histone H3 in which lysine 27 is substituted with methionine (H3K27M) in nearly 80% of DIPGs. H3K27M inhibits Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) activity by binding to its catalytic subunit EZH2 and although DIPGs with H3K27M mutation show global loss of H3 with trimethylated lysine 27 (H3K27me3), several genomic loci are still H3K27me3 positive. Here, we describe a new mouse DIPG model in which H3K27M potentiates tumourigenesis. Using this model and primary patient-derived DIPG cell lines, we show that H3K27M expressing tumours require PRC2 for proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that small molecule EZH2 inhibitors abolish in vitro and in vivo tumour cell growth through a mechanism involving induction of the tumour suppressor protein p16INK4A. In agreement with this, we show that tumour cells with inactivated p16INK4A function do not respond to EZH2 inhibitors. By analysing genome-wide H3K27me3 enrichment profile in mouse DIPG model, we highlight distinct features of the loci that lose or retain H3K27me3 in H3K27M expressing cells. Taken together these results show that residual PRC2 activity is required for the proliferation of H3K27M positive DIPGs, and we propose a therapeutic strategy for these tumours using EZH2 inhibitors and expression of p16INK4A as a marker for stratifying potential responding tumours. Expression profile was analyzed in mouse DIPG cells expressing wild-type or K27M mutant H3.3 in presence or absence of Ezh2 inhibitor using RNA-seq.",

HCC515 lung cells with dox-inducible KEAP1 knockdown and/or STK11 re-addition, under two different metabolic stress conditions, baseline vs. suspension, were transcriptionally profiled to investigate whether KEAP1 knockdown can rescue metabolic defects in STK11-null cancer cells and how the regulation of the transcriptome by KEAP1 knockdown is affected by STK11 status and different metabolic stress conditions.In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), stabilization of the transcription factor NRF2 through genomic alterations in KEAP1 and NFE2L2 occurs in roughly a quarter of patients, often in the context of STK11 tumor suppressor loss. In this study, we demonstrate that NRF2 activation in the context of concurrent KRAS mutation and STK11 loss promotes aggressive LUAD tumor behavior in both human and mouse preclinical models. This phenotype is associated with metabolic rewiring and rescue by NRF2 of redox stress, high in STK11 null tumors. Applying a novel, pan-lung cancer, diagnostic NRF2 activation gene expression signature that is independent of frequently co-occurring mutations, we dissect the independent contributions of the three most frequent genetic events in human LUAD (NRF2 activation, STK11 loss and KRAS mutations) on patient prognosis and clinical responses in a dataset of second-line LUAD patients treated with immunotherapy or chemotherapy (OAK trial). Our findings underscore that both individual effects and epistatic relationships among oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways influence tumor biology, immune contexture and patient clinical outcomes. Our work also highlights the value of lung cancer disease sub-classification based on genetic and expression profiling as part of patient clinical management. HCC515 stable cells (KEAP1-wildtype, STK11-null) were plated in 10% Tet-Free FBS media.

Understanding the interactions between tumors and the host immune system holds great promise to uncover biomarkers for targeted therapies, predict the prognosis of patients and guide clinical treatment. However, the immune signatures of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remain largely unstudied in terms of systematic analyses. We aimed to classify GBM samples according to immune-related genes and complement the existing immunotherapy system knowledge. In this study, we designed a strategy to identify 3 immune subtypes representing 3 different immune microenvironments (M1-M3) and associated with prognosis. The three subtypes were significantly different in terms of specific immune characteristics (immune cell subpopulations, immune responses, immune cells and checkpoint gene interactions). In additional, somatic alterations and methylation changes were identified that correlated with genes related to a worse prognosis subtype in the microenvironment. More importantly, in M3 (worst prognosis subtype) and M2 (best prognosis subtype), the interaction between immune cells and checkpoint genes was different, and this had an important effect on the prognosis. Finally, we used risk scores of immune cells and checkpoint genes to evaluate the prognosis of GBM patients and validated the results with 3 independent datasets. Disordered interactions between immune cells and checkpoint genes result in a change in the immune microenvironment and affects the prognosis of patients. We propose that a better understanding of the immune microenvironment of advanced cancers may provide new insights into immunotherapy. There are 89 samples.

Infection of resting primary B-lymphocytes by Epstein Barr virus (EBV) generates a population of cells that are effectively immortal. This represents the first step in the establishment of life-long viral latency in vivo and generates precursors that can develop into the lymphoid malignancies. However, virus spread requires a switch from latency to the lytic replication cycle, a process orchestrated by the virally encoded protein Zta, an AP1-like transcription factor that interacts with a 7 base-pair DNA sequence element. As Zta has the potential to reprogram the patterns of gene expression in the host cell, we undertook global transcriptome analyses (RNA sequencing) in a Burkitt's lymphoma derived cell line in which the Zta is expressed from an inducible promoter, mimicking the switch from latency to lytic cycle. We identified 2,263 host genes whose expression levels were altered. In parallel, we performed chromatin precipitation and next-generation DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to identify genes that are direct targets of Zta. Integrating these data sets revealed 277 host genes that appear to be directly regulated by Zta. Surprisingly, the frequency and distribution of the Zta binding peaks suggests that Zta regulates host genes through long-range enhancers, with a median distance of 25.8kb from the transcriptional start site, rather than equivalents of the promoter elements through which Zta regulates viral genes. Akata cells transduced with a plasmid encoding Zta, NGFR and GFP from a doxycycline regulated promoter, and control cells in which the Zta sequences were in the opposite orientation, were treated with 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 24h. The NGFR-expressing cells were isolated with anti-NGFR antibodies coupled to paramagnetic beads.

Transplacental immune programming refers to the concept that during pregnancy, significant crosstalk occurs between the maternal and fetal immune system, with consequent long-term effects especially for the offspring. In this study, we searched for evidence of transplacental programming in cellular immunity. We made the surprising observation that there is a stringent and specific correlation of regulatory T cells (Treg) between the mother and the fetus. Gene microarray analysis indicates that interleukin 10 (IL-10) might be involved in transplacental Treg alignment. This is further supported by the direct correlation of IL-10 at a protein level between maternal fetal dyads. In vitro data provide evidence that IL-10 may regulate the homeostatic balance between Tregs and non-Tregs through selective upregulation of the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2 in Tregs. Induction of IL-10 might be triggered by fetus-derived estriol (E3), which readily crosses the placenta and correlates with maternal IL- 10 levels. Our study represents the first example of transplacental regulation of cellular immunity between the mother and the fetus.

However, a coherent understanding of the regulatory networks affected by Polycomb during gliomagenesis is still lacking. Here we integrate transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses to define Polycomb-dependent networks that promote gliomagenesis, validating them both in two independent mouse models and in a large cohort of human samples.

The dissection of these networks uncovers Zfp423 as a crtitical Polycomb-dependent transcription factor whose silencing negatively impacts survival.

The increased heme biosynthesis long observed in leukemia was previously of unknown significance. Heme, synthesized from porphyrin precursors, plays a central role in oxygen metabolism and mitochondrial function, yet little is known about its role in leukemogenesis. Here we show increased expression of heme biosynthetic genes, including UROD, only in pediatric AML with high MYCN expression. Both high UROD and MYCN expression predict poor overall survival and unfavorable outcomes in adult AML. Murine leukemic progenitors derived from hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) overexpressing a MYCN cDNA (MYCN-HPC) require heme/porphyrin biosynthesis, accompanied by increased oxygen consumption, to fully engage in self-renewal and oncogenic transformation. Blocking heme biosynthesis reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption and markedly suppressed self-renewal. Leukemic progenitors rely on balanced production of heme and heme intermediates, the porphyrins. Porphyrin homeostasis is required because absence of the porphyrin exporter, ABCG2, increased death of leukemic progenitors in vitro and prolonged the survival of mice transplanted with Abcg2-KO MYCN HPCs. Pediatric AML patients with elevated MYCN mRNA display strong activation of TP53 target genes. Abcg2-KO MYCN HPCs were rescued from porphyrin toxicity by p53 loss. This vulnerability was exploited to show that treatment with a porphyrin precursor, coupled with the absence of ABCG2, blocked MYCN-driven leukemogenesis in vivo thereby demonstrating, that porphyrin homeostasis is a pathway crucial to MYCN leukemogenesis.We used microarrays to compare the global transcription profiles of hematopoietic progenitor cells from wild-type and Abcg2-ko mice that after transduction with vector-alone or vector containing MYCN gene.

Using ribosome profiling of the hippocampus, we find that ribosome footprint levels in Fmr1-deficient tissue mostly reflect changes in RNA abundance. Profiling over a time course of ribosome runoff in wildtype tissue reveals a wide range of ribosome translocation rates; on many mRNAs, the ribosomes are stalled. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of hippocampal slices after ribosome runoff reveals that FMRP co-sediments with stalled ribosomes; and its loss results in decline of ribosome stalling on specific mRNAs. One such mRNA encodes SETD2, a lysine methyltransferase that catalyzes H3K36me3. ChIP-Seq demonstrates that loss of FMRP alters the deployment of this epigenetic mark on chromatin. H3K36me3 is associated with alternative pre-RNA processing, which we find occurs in an FMRP-dependent manner on transcripts linked to neural function and autism spectrum disorders.

Using a faithful mouse model of CHN, we rescued the myelination defects by activation of Nrg1 type III. Unexpectedly, rescue did not depend on upregulation of Egr2 or major myelin genes. Therefore we asked whether we could identify any transcriptomic signature of the canonical pathways downstream of Nrg1 type III that could explain the increase in myelination in the sciatic nerve.Methods: Sciatic nerve mRNA profiles of 30-day-old wild-type (WT), P0 mutant (Q215X/+), trangenic HA-NRG1 type III, and HA-NRG1 type III:Q215X mice were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2500 . The sequence reads that passed quality filters were aligned to the mouse reference genome (mm10) with the transcript annotation (UCSC mm10 annotation download from TopHat website) using TopHat (v2.0.9). Quantification for the gene expression and differential expression analysis were done by the software Cufflinks (v2.2.0).Results: A comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of signals downstream of neuregulin 1 type III in rescued CHN nerves revealed imbalanced activation of MAPK/ERK signals and minor myelin genes, such as Pmp2 and Omg.Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that although augmented Nrg1 type III activity modifies the composition of myelin, it still promotes thicker myelin and ameliorates nerve conduction velocity in a mouse model of CHN.

Knocking down PARVB expression in vitrocaused apparent decreases in cell migration and wound healing, implying that PARVB has a crucial role in cellular motility. Moreover, metastasis-free survival was significantly lowered in patients with higher PARVB expression. Therefore overexpression of PARVB is a candidate biomarker for endophytic tumor and metastasis and may be clinically applicable for decision making of an adjuvant therapy in TSCC. Twenty seven OCT embedded tissues were used to extract total RNA. Then RNAs were amplified, biotinylated, fragmented and hybridized on GeneChip Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 arrays.",

This study was undertaken to identify how gene expression of the urothelial cells respond to Enterococcus infection over the course of infection. 239 hypervariable (HV) genes were found to vary significantly over the time points, indicating a biological role in infection. Correlational clustering showed these HV genes fell into distinct families indicating a defined sequence of events following infection. Early events (0-1.5 hours post infection) were associated with upregulation of not well-known but bladder-associated genes which represented early immune response, cytoskeleton remodeling and cell cycle. Up- and downregulated genes at the middle time period (1.5-8 hours post infection) represented a variety of processes, from immune response/suppression, cell cycle/apoptosis to metabolism and cytoskeleton remodeling. Several transcription factors point to multiple pathways activation. At the late time points (8-10 hours post infection) downregulated genes represented major events of cell death, matrix degradation and immune response decline. Confocal microscopy confirms major cell death at these time points. Several events and pathways, like immune response suppression or cytoskeleton remodeling via Wnt/b-catenin and/or Rho/Rac pathway, were identified throughout the time course of HUC infection by Enterococcus. Those may be new targets for preventing and/or cure Enterococcus caused pathology.Keywords: Enterococcus, time course, microarray, infection, gene expression.

WNT-induced secreted protein 1 (WISP1/CCN4), a member of the CCN protein family, acts as a downstream factor of the canonical WNT-signaling pathway. A dysregulated expression of WISP1 often reflects its oncogenic potential by inhibition of apoptosis, a necessary form of cell death that protect cell populations for transformation into malignant phenotypes. WISP1-signaling is also known to affect proliferation and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), which are fundamental for the constitution and maintenance of the musculoskeletal system. Our study emphasizes the importance of WISP1-signaling for cell survival of primary human cells. Therefore, we established a successful down-regulation of endogenous WISP1 transcripts through gene silencing in hMSCs. We were able to demonstrate the consequence of cell death immediately after WISP1 down-regulation took place. Bioinformatical analyses of subsequent performed microarrays from WISP1 down-regulated vs. control samples confirmed this observation. We uncovered several clusters of differential expressed genes important for cellular apoptosis induction and immuno-regulatory processes, thereby indicating TRAIL-induced and p53-mediated apoptosis as well as IFNbeta-signaling. Since all of them act as potent inhibitors for malignant cell growth, in vitro knowledge about the connection with WISP1-signaling could help to find new therapeutic approaches concerning cancerogenesis and tumor growth in musculoskeletal tissues. We established a successful down-regulation of endogenous WISP1 transcripts through gene silencing in hMSCs.Knock-down versus controls.",

As Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, multiplies in the cytoplasm of nucleated host cells, infection with this parasite is highly likely to affect host cells. We performed an exhaustive transcriptome analysis of T. cruzi-infected HeLa cells using an oligonucleotide microarray containing probes for greater than 47,000 human gene transcripts. In comparison with uninfected cells, those infected with T. cruzi showed greater than threefold up-regulation of 41 genes and greater than threefold down-regulation of 23 genes. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of selected, differentially expressed genes confirmed the microarray data. Many of these up- and down-regulated genes were related to cellular proliferation, including seven up-regulated genes encoding proliferation inhibitors and three down-regulated genes encoding proliferation promoters, strongly suggesting that T. cruzi infection inhibits host cell proliferation, which may allow more time for T. cruzi to replicate and produce its intracellular nests. These findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms by which intracellular T. cruzi infection influences the host cell, leading to pathogenicity.Keywords: infection response.

Williams Syndrome (WS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by heterozygous deletions in a chromosome 7q11.23 region typically encompassing 26-28 genes. WS patients exhibit a wide spectrum of symptoms, including cardiovascular disease, intellectual disability, visuospatial deficits and hypersociability a behavioral profile that contrasts with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the relationship between neuropsychiatric phenotypes and dysregulated gene networks caused by the 7q11.23 deletion is unknown. We report results from a large-scale integrated transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood in clinically evaluated subjects with WS, ASD and matched controls. We identified significantly differential expressed genes in WS as compared with ASD or controls, even after removing genes spanning the 7q11.23 region. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we found that three co-expression modules were upregulated in WS, and were significantly associated with the intermediate phenotypes such as anxiety and attention problems. Notably, these three co-expression modules were only composed of genes located outside of 7q11.23 critical region. One module was associated with immune systems and B cell proliferation. Its top hub gene, BCL11A, is implicated in ASD and chromatin modification. Another module was enriched with genes associated with astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and the third module was associated with RNA processing and neurons. MicroRNA (miRNA) profiling revealed differentially expressed miRNAs whose targets were enriched in each co-expression module associated with WS. These results identify genes and potential driver miRNAs, located outside of 7q11.23 critical region, that are novel candidates for mediating the neuropsychiatric phenotypes in WS. We profiled gene expression from 32 WS patients, 32 ASD patients and 30 controls using peripheral blood.",

Functional reconstitution of p18INK4C in GBM cells null for both p16INK4A and p18INK4C resulted in impaired cell-cycle progression and tumorigenic potential.

While Rbfox1 functions as a splicing regulator in the nucleus, it is also alternatively spliced to produce cytoplasmic isoforms. To investigate cytoplasmic Rbfox1, we knocked down Rbfox proteins in mouse neurons and rescued with cytoplasmic or nuclear Rbfox1. Transcriptome profiling showed that nuclear Rbfox1 rescued splicing changes induced by knockdown, whereas cytoplasmic Rbfox1 rescued changes in mRNA levels. iCLIP-seq of subcellular fractions revealed that in nascent RNA Rbfox1 bound predominantly to introns, while cytoplasmic Rbox1 bound to 3' UTRs. Cytoplasmic Rbfox1 binding increased target mRNA stability and translation, and overlapped significantly with miRNA binding sites. Cytoplasmic Rbfox1 target mRNAs were enriched in genes involved in cortical development and autism. Our results uncover a new Rbfox1 regulatory network and highlight the importance of cytoplasmic RNA metabolism to cortical development and disease.

Additionally, we compared genes specifically regulated by p38 and ERKs with those regulated by JNK and by all three pathways simultaneously. We find that the p38 pathway induces the expression of extracellular matrix and proliferation-associated genes, while suppressing microtubule-associated genes; the ERK pathway induces the expression of nuclear envelope and mRNA splicing proteins, while suppressing steroid synthesis and mitochondrial energy production enzymes. Both pathways promote epidermal differentiation and induce feedback inactivation of MAPK signaling. c-FOS, SRY and N-Myc appear to be the principal targets of the p38 pathway, Elk-1 SAP1 and HLH2 of ERK, while FREAC-4, ARNT and USF are common to both.

Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are incorporated into consumer products to prevent flame propagation. These compounds leach into the domestic environment, resulting in chronic exposure and contamination. Pregnancy failure is associated with high levels of BFRs in human follicular fluid, raising serious questions regarding their impact on female fertility. Our goal was to elucidate effects of a mixture reflecting human follicular fluid levels of polybrominated flame retardants (PBDEs), the major class of BFRs, on an immortalized human granulosa cell line, the KGN cell line. We showed that cell viability was altered and oxidative stress was induced, as reflected by increased reactive oxygen species formation, at 20 uM of the PBDE mixture. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that several genes showing an altered expression after the PBDE treatment were involved in oxidative stress signaling pathways. Significant dose-dependent reduction of progesterone and estradiol levels was measured after PBDE treatment; expression of genes involved in steroid hormone metabolism, namely CYP1A1, was significantly affected by PBDEs. Treatment with the PBDE mixture also modified genes encoding for members of the transforming growth factor b superfamily like inhibins and cytokines, including the pro-inflammatory factor, interleukin-6 (IL6). Concentration of IL-6 in KGN cell culture media was consistently increased after treatment with the PBDE mixture. Our results clearly demonstrate that the PBDEs detected in human follicular fluid alter human granulosa cell functions by inducing oxidative stress, disrupting steroidogenesis and triggering an inflammatory response. This strengthens the fact that PBDEs are detrimental to ovarian functions and thus, to women's reproductive health. KGN cells were exposed to 0, 1, 5 and 20 uM of a PBDE mixture for 48h; n=6 in triplicates for each experiments except for samples at 5 uM of a PBDE, for which there are 5 replicates.",

Purpose: We identified KPC1 as the ubiquitin ligase that binds to the p105 precursor of NF-kB, ubiquitinates it and mediates its proteasomal processing to generate the p50 active subunit of the transcription factor. Using U87-MG human glioblastoma xenografts, we observed that overexpression of KPC1 results in strong inhibition of tumor growth mediated via excessive generation of p50.The goal of this RNASeq study was to analyze the profile of gene expression in xenografts overexpressing control (V0), KPC1 or p50 vectors, and to further understand how the altered gene expression patterns can explain the tumor suppressive effect we observed.Results:Transcript analysis of U87-MG xenografts overexpressing control (V0), KPC1 or p50 vector mapped to the human genome revealed:* A strong similarity between overexpression of p50 and KPC1 (correlation of 0.51, p-value<10-300 )* A specific signature of NF-kB targets [21 of the consistently changed genes are known to be regulated by NF-kB (p-value<3.4x10-9 )]* A significant (p-value<1.4x10-18) increase in the expression of 40 tumor suppressor genes, with no significant change in other classes.* A significant down regulation of a cluster of genes including LIN28B, IL-6, HMAGA2 and VEGFA. This finding links well to an established regulatory axis involving LIN28B, Let-7 microRNA, and IL-6 in inflammation and cell transformation that is regulated by NF-kB. Exponentially growing U87-MG cells were stably transfected with an empty vector (V0) or vectors coding for Myc-KPC1 or Flag-p50. Cells were dissociated with trypsin, washed with PBS, and brought to a concentration of 50x10^6 cells/ml. Cell suspension (5x10^6/0.1 ml) was inoculated subcutaneously at the right flank of 7-weeks old male Balb/C nude mice (n=7).

Gene expression data from VHL teratomas comparing genes differentially expressed based on apoptotic response to tumor microenvironment.AbstractBACKGROUND:The risk relevance of the P81S von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene hotspot mutation identified in clear cell renal cell carcinoma from individuals exposed occupationally to trichloroethylene (TCE) is not known. VHL mutations in hereditary VHL syndrome strongly correlate with phenotypic associations, but specific sporadic mutations in VHL that uniquely alter its protein function may provide a selective growth advantage for somatic cells harboring these mutations.METHODS:VHL deficient (Vhl -/- ) mouse embryonic stem cells were generated that stably express wild-type, P81S, or R167Q human VHL protein. Under hypoxic conditions, cell lines were examined for hypoxia-inducible transcription factor family (HIF) stabilization and E3-ubiquitin ligase complex interactions. In vivo, teratomas were examined for tumor size, proliferation, apoptosis, and immunohistochemistry and subjected to gene expression analysis. Wild-type, R167Q, and P81S VHL-expressing teratomas were also exposed to 5 Gy ionizing radiation to quantify apoptotic response. Proliferation and apoptosis and teratoma growth were analyzed by either Student t test or analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS:The P81S VHL mutation produces deregulation of HIF factors in cell culture but exhibits a growth advantage in the tumor microenvironment, in part because of suppression of apoptosis (P81S mean = 0.9%, 95% confidence interval = 0.6 to 1.2%; WT mean = 7.6%; 95% confidence interval = 6.4 to 8.8%; P < .001) coupled with sustained proliferation. Transcriptional analysis of P81S teratomas revealed the induction of metabolic pathways, antiapoptotic genes, and global suppression of key DNA damage response genes not observed in VHL wild-type or R167Q mutants. In vivo irradiation exposure showed that P81S mutant is resistant to ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis.CONCLUSIONS:The TCE-associated P81S VHL mutation can initiate a unique adaptive response required for selective tumor growth through pleiotropic effects on metabolic diversification, apoptosis suppression, and alteration of the DNA damage response. Three genotypes of VHL teratomas were examined: Three replicate wildtype VHL, Three replicate R167Q VHL, and Four replicate P81S VHL (representing two replicates of two different P81S clones).",

The goal of this project was to identify the downstream genes regulated by Adamts16 (the function of Adamts16 has yet to be fully delineated). Gene expression differences resulting from these siRNA-mediated gene knockdown experiments will be compared to the gene expression profiling experiments comparing kidneys from Dahl salt-senstive hypertensive inbred strain versus less hypertensive S.LEW(D1MCO4x1x3Bx1) congenic strain.

Transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) in neural progenitors and early differentiating neurons revealed that CHD8 hemizygosity (CHD8+/-) affected the expression of several thousands of genes, enriched for functions of neural development, b-catenin/Wnt signaling, extracellular matrix, and skeletal system development.

Previous studies showed that mesenchymal tumors fare more poorly than the proneural subtype. We focused on STAT3 because its activation precedes the proneural-mesenchymal transition. We first established a STAT3 gene signature that stratifies GBM patients into STAT3-high and -low cohorts. STAT3 inhibitor treatment selectively mitigated STAT3-high cell viability and tumorigenicity in orthotopic mouse xenograft models. Additionally, we defined the mechanism underlying resistance in STAT3-low cells by combining STAT3 signature analysis with kinome screen data on STAT3 inhibitor-treated cells. This allows us to draw connections between kinases affected by STAT3 inhibitors, their associated transcription factors and target genes. We demonstrate that dual inhibition of IGF-1R and STAT3 sensitized STAT3-low cells and improved survival in mice.

Recent developments in cell reprogramming suggest that NSC may be derived directly from adult fibroblasts. We generated NSC from adult human peripheral CD34+ cells by transfecting the cells with Sendai virus constructs containing Sox-2, Oct3/4, C-MyC and Klf-4.

A c-Src inhibitor blocks estrogen (E2)-induced stress and converts E2 responses from inducing apoptosis to growth stimulation in E2-deprived breast cancer cells. A reprogrammed cell line, MCF-7:PF, results with features of functional estrogen receptor (ER) and over-expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor beta (IGF-1Rb). We addressed the question of whether the selective ER modulator 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) could target ER to prevent E2-stimulated growth in MCF-7:PF cells. Selected expression of mRNA was measured through real-time RT-PCR. Global gene expression was analyzed by microarray and RNA-seq analysis. Unexpectedly, both 4-OHT and E2 stimulated cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner. Global gene expression analysis showed a remarkable overlap in genes regulated in the same direction by E2 and 4-OHT. Pathway enrichment analysis of the 280 genes commonly deregulated by 4-OHT and E2 revealed functions mainly related to membrane, cytoplasm, and metabolic processes. Further analysis of 98 up-regulated genes by both 4-OHT and E2 uncovered a significant enrichment in genes associated with membrane remodeling, cytoskeleton reorganization, cytoplasmic adapter proteins, cytoplasm organelles proteins, and related processes. 4-OHT was more potent than E2 to up-regulate some membrane remodeling molecules, such as EHD2, FHL2, HOMER3 and RHOF. In contrast, 4-OHT acted as an antagonist to inhibit expression of the majority of enriched membrane-associated genes in wild-type MCF-7 cells. Long-term selection pressure has changed the cell population responses to 4-OHT. Membrane-associated signaling is critical for 4-OHT-stimulated cell growth in MCF-7:PF cells. This study provides a rationale for the further investigation of targeted therapy for tamoxifen resistant patients.

    "text": "Interferon signaling and treatment outcome in chronic hepatitis C. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. The current standard therapy for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) consists of a combination of pegylated IFN alpha (pegIFN-alpha) and ribavirin. It achieves a sustained viral clearance in only 50-60% of patients. To learn more about molecular mechanisms underlying treatment failure, we investigated IFN-induced signaling in paired liver biopsies collected from CHC patients before and after administration of pegIFN-alpha. In patients with a rapid virological response to treatment, pegIFN-alpha induced a strong up-regulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). As shown previously, nonresponders had high expression levels of ISGs before therapy. Analysis of posttreatment biopsies of these patients revealed that pegIFN-alpha did not induce expression of ISGs above the pretreatment levels. In accordance with ISG expression data, phosphorylation, DNA binding, and nuclear localization of STAT1 indicated that the IFN signaling pathway in nonresponsive patients is preactivated and refractory to further stimulation. Some features characteristic of nonresponders were more accentuated in patients infected with HCV genotypes 1 and 4 compared with genotypes 2 and 3, providing a possible explanation for the poor response of the former group to therapy. Taken together with previous findings, our data support the concept that activation of the endogenous IFN system in CHC not only is ineffective in clearing the infection but also may impede the response to therapy, most likely by inducing a refractory state of the IFN signaling pathway.Keywords: Comparison of human patient biopses before and after interferon treatment.

    "text": "RNA-Seq analysis of murine splenic B cells with deletion of YY1. X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female lymphocytes is uniquely regulated, as the inactive X (Xi) chromosome lacks localized Xist RNA and heterochromatin modifications. Epigenetic profiling reveals that Xist RNA is lost from the Xi at the pro-B cell stage and that additional heterochromatic modifications are gradually lost during B cell development. Activation of mature B cells restores Xist RNA and heterochromatin to the Xi in a dynamic two-step process that differs in timing and pattern, depending on the method of B cell stimulation. Finally, we find that DNA binding by YY1 maintains XCI in activated B cells, as ex-vivo YY1 deletion results in loss of Xi heterochromatin marks and up-regulation of X-linked genes. Ectopic expression of the YY1 zinc finger domain is sufficient for Xist RNA localization during B cell activation. Together, our results indicate that Xist RNA localization is critical for maintaining XCI in female lymphocytes, and that chromatin changes on the Xi during B cell development and the dynamic nature of YY1-dependent XCI maintenance in mature B cells predisposes X- linked immunity genes to reactivation. Follicular B cells were isolated from the spleens of six (three males and three females) C57Bl/6 yy1 fl/fl mice. For each spleen, 1/3 of the cells were not treated with any reagent (naive cells), 1/3 the cells received mock treatment (mock cells) and 1/3 received TATCRE (tatcre cells). The mock and tatcre samples were then grown in RPMI medium along with anti-IgM and 20% FBS for 48 hours. All cells were lysed and RNA was isolated for library preparation. Expression differences between Mock and TATCRE treated cells were determined to understand the role of yy1 in B cell activation.",

Beginning with precursor lesions, aberrant DNA methylation marks the entire spectrum of prostate cancer progression. We mapped the global DNA methylation patterns in selected prostate tissues and cell lines using Methylplex-Next Generation Sequencing (M-NGS). Hidden Markov Model based next generation sequence analysis identified ~68,000 methylated regions per sample. While global CpG Island (CGI) methylation was not differential between benign adjacent and cancer samples, overall promoter CGI methylation increased from ~12.6% in benign samples to 19.3% and 21.8% in localized and metastatic cancer tissues, respectively. We found distinct patterns of promoter methylation around transcription start sites, where methylation occurred not only on the CGIs, but also on flanking regions and CGI sparse promoters. Among the 6,691 methylated promoters in prostate tissues, 2481 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are cancer specific, including numerous novel DMRs. A novel cancer specific DMR in WFDC2 promoter showed heavy methylation in cancer (17/22 tissues, 6/6 cell lines), but not in the benign tissues (0/10) and normal PrEC cells. Integration of LNCaP DNA methylation and H3K4me3 data suggested an epigenetic mechanism for alternate transcription start site utilization and these modifications segregated into distinct regions when present on the same promoter. Finally, we observed differences in repeat element methylation, particularly LINE-1, between ERG gene fusion positive and negative cancers.

Glioblastoma ranks as one of the most lethal human cancers, with no effective therapies. To discover novel therapeutic targets, here we performed parallel in vivo and in vitro RNA interference screens of epigenetic regulators and show that transcription elongation factors are essential for human glioblastoma cell survival in vivo, but not in vitro. Context-specific dependency in vivo is driven by microenvironment-induced global changes in the cancer epigenome. JMJD6, a top in vivo-specific hit, binds at enhancers and correlates with increased transcription of known pause-controlled genes. JMJD6 knockdown in patient-derived glioblastoma cells enhances survival of mice bearing orthotopic tumors. Moreover, elevated levels of JMJD6 alone, as well as transcription elongation factors collectively, informs tumor grade and predicts poor prognosis for patients. Our work provides a rationale for targeting transcription elongation as a therapeutic strategy in glioblastoma and, more broadly, the power of in vivo phenotypic screening to identify therapeutically relevant targets in cancer.

Biallelic mutations of the DNA annealing helicase SMARCAL1 (SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a-like 1) cause Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD, MIM 242900), an incompletely penetrant autosomal recessive disorder. Using human, Drosophila, and mouse models, we show that the proteins encoded by SMARCAL1 orthologues localize to transcriptionally active chromatin and modulate gene expression. We also show that similar to SIOD patients, deficiency of the SMARCAL1 orthologues alone is insufficient to cause disease in fruit flies and mice although such deficiency causes modest diffuse alterations in gene expression. Rather, disease manifests when SMARCAL1 deficiency interacts with genetic and environmental factors that further alter gene expression. We conclude that the SMARCAL1 annealing helicase buffers fluctuations in gene expression and that alterations in gene expression contribute to the penetrance of SIOD. For analysis of gene expression in primary cultured human dermal fibroblasts, 5.0 mg of total RNA from three biologically independent replicates was extracted from two SIOD (SD8 and SD60) and a control skin fibroblast cell lines, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays.",

The prevalence of immune-mediated diseases such as allergies and autoimmune diseases is on the rise in the developed world. Microbial exposure is known to modulate the risk for these diseases. In order to explore differences in the gene expression patterns induced in utero in infants born in contrasting standards of living and hygiene, we collected umbilical cord blood RNA samples from full-term newborn infants born with normal vaginal delivery in Finland (modern society), Estonia (rapidly developing society) and the Republic of Karelia, Russia (poor economical conditions). Transcriptomic profiles were analyzed using whole genome microarrays including gender, gestational age, birth month and HLA allele genotype as confounding variables in the analysis. The data revealed that the whole blood transcriptome of Finnish and Estonian neonates differ from their Karelian counterparts. Samples from Karelian infants had an increase in transcripts associated with LPS induction and bacterial sepsis observed in 1-year-old infants in earlier studies. The results suggest exposure to toll like receptor (TLR) ligands and a more matured immune response in infants born in Petrozavodsk compared to the Finnish and Estonian infants. These results further support the concept of a conspicuous plasticity in the developing immune system: the environmental factors that play a role in the susceptibility/protection towards immune-mediated diseases begin to shape the neonatal immunity already in utero and direct the maturation of both the adaptive and the innate immune responses in accordance with the surrounding microbial milieu. Umbilical cord blood was drawn into Tempus Blood RNA tubes (Applied Biosystems) from children born between January and May 2010 at the maternity unit of Jorvi hospital (Espoo, Finland; n=48), maternity units of Tartu and Polva (Estonia; n=25), or two maternity departments in Petrozavodsk (capital of the Republic of Karelia, Russian Federation; n=40) according to the manufacturer's protocol and then stored in -70 degC until analyzed.

In the clinical setting, we have discovered a Hes6-associated signature that predicts poor outcome in prostate cancer, which could be pharmacologically targeted. LNCaP-LM (luciferase expressing) cells with stable Hes6-overexpression and empty vector controls injected dorso-subcutaneously into NOD SCID gamma (NSG) mice.

Comparison of transcriptional profile of CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes terated with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin or the mTOR inhibitor KU-0063794 and comparison with proteomic analysis.Abstract: High resolution mass spectrometry maps the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) proteome and the impact of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) on CTL. We show that the CTL proteome is dominated by metabolic regulators and granzymes and that mTORC1 selectively represses and promotes expression of a protein subset (~10%) including key CTL effector molecules and signaling proteins. mTORC1 also controlled flux through a subset of metabolic pathways rather than acting as an on/off switch for global CTL metabolism. Proteomic data highlighted the potential for mTORC1 negative control of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) production in CTL. Further work revealed that mTORC1 represses PIP3 production and determines the mTORC2 requirement for activation of the serine/threonine kinase AKT. Unbiased proteomic analysis thus provides a comprehensive understanding of CTL identity and mTORC1 control of CTL function. Spleens from three biological replicates (control and drug treated samples were generated from the same spleens) from P14 TCR transgenic mice were harvested and activated with the antigenic peptide gp33-41 and IL-2/12 for 48h. After activation, cells were further clonally expanded in the presence of IL-2/12 for a further 96h prior to RNA extraction and hybridization to Affymetrix microarray.",

EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors cause dramatic responses in EGFR-mutant lung cancer, but resistance universally develops. The involvement of b-catenin in EGFR TKI resistance has been previously reported however the precise mechanism by which b-catenin activation contributes to EGFR TKI resistance is not clear. Here, we show that EGFR inhibition results in the activation of b-catenin signaling in a Notch3-dependent manner, which facilitates the survival of a subset of cells that we call \"adaptive persisters\". We previously reported that EGFR-TKI treatment rapidly activates Notch3, and here describe the physical association of Notch3 with b-catenin, leading to increased stability and activation of b-catenin. We demonstrate that the combination of EGFR-TKI and a b-catenin inhibitor inhibits the development of these adaptive persisters, decreases tumor burden, improves recurrence free survival, and overall survival in xenograft models. These results supports combined EGFR-TKI and b-catenin inhibition in patients with EGFR mutant lung cancer. HCC4006 cells were transfected with NTC, Notch1 or Notch3 siRNAs.

Purpose: The hepatoblasts are found to be optimal stage, compared with hepatic stem cells (hHpSCs) and mature hepatocytes (hHeps). To identify the cellular determinants that correlated with HCV infection during hES cells' differentiation, transcriptome profiling of cells at hHpSC, hHB, PreHep and hHep stages were compared with RNA sequencing.Results: In general, the gene expression profile of cells at each stage clustered closer to the HCV infected cells at the same stages. The genes involved in regulation of liver development were up-regulated along with processes of maturation. Among the genes positively related to HCV replication, ABCB6, CEBPD, TNFRSF10C, GTF3A, HAS1, UBE2J1 were highly expressed in mature hHeps, while IGFBP6, SMAD6, ITGA7 etc. were highly expressed in progenitor hHB stage. Most of the 66 genes reported to be involved in HCV assembly and secretion remained unchanged, except CX3CL1 and PROX1 increased in mature hepatocyte and ARHGAF increased in rogenitors. Families of viral restriction factors reported involved in HCV infection were significantly enriched in hHeps. Conclusions: HCV does not change the transcription profile of induced cells and use different genes to support HCV replication in the cells from different stage.

Identification of differential gene regulation pattern in human liposarcomaThe FUS-CHOP fusion protein has been found to be instrumental for specific oncogenic processes in liposarcoma, but its ability to induce metastasis and the underlying mechanisms by which this can be achieved remain unknown. In order to dissect its functional role in this context, we stably overexpressed this protein in SW872 liposarcoma and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell lines, and were able to demonstrate that forced expression of FUS-CHOP significantly increases migration and invasion, as well as enhance lung and liver metastasis in the in vivo chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model, that is proliferation independent. Additionally, FUS-CHOP enhances the expression of matrix-metalloproteinases -2 and -9, and transactivates their promoters in vitro. Mutational analysis showed that C/EBP-b- (-769/-755), NF-kB (-525/-516) and CREB/AP-1 (-218/-207) sites were important for MMP-2, and NF-kB (-604/-598), AP-1 (-539/-532) and AP-1 (-81/-72) for MMP-9 transactivation. Moreover, a direct in vivo interaction of FUS-CHOP was observed in case of the MMP-2 promoter within region (-769/-207). siRNA data revealed that MMP-2 expression is essential in the FUS-CHOP induced metastatic phenotype. MMP-2-mRNA and protein expression correlated significantly with FUS-CHOP positivity in 31 resected patient liposarcoma tissues. We have for the first time provided substantial evidence for the FUS-CHOP oncoprotein as an inducer of metastasis that is due to the transcriptional induction of specific tumor-associated proteases. Insights gained from this study not only support a deeper understanding of the mechanistic properties of FUS-CHOP, but also open up new avenues for targeted therapy. 3 liposarcoma tumor samples, 3 corresponding normal samples, one sample replicated.",

When adapting to environmental stress, cells attenuate and reprogram their translational output. In part, these altered translation profiles are established through changes in the interactions between RNA-binding proteins and mRNAs. The Ago2/microRNA machinery has been shown to participate in stress-induced translational upregulation of a particular mRNA, CAT-1; however, a detailed, transcriptome-wide understanding of the involvement of Ago2 in the process has been lacking. Here, we profiled the overall changes in Ago2-mRNA interactions upon arsenite stress by CLIP-seq. Ago2 displayed a significant remodeling of its transcript occupancy, with the majority of 3' UTR and CDS sites exhibiting stronger interaction. Interestingly, target sites that were destined for release from Ago2 upon stress were depleted in miRNA complementarity signatures, suggesting an alternative mode of interaction. To compare the changes in Ago2 binding patterns across transcripts with changes in their translational states, we measured mRNA profiles on ribosome/polysome gradients by RNA-seq. Increased Ago2 occupancy correlated with stronger repression of translation for those mRNAs, as evidenced by a shift toward lighter gradient fractions upon stress, while release of Ago2 was associated with the limited number of transcripts that remained translated. Taken together, these data point to a role for Ago2 and the mammalian microRNAs in mediating the translational component of the stress response. In this sub-series, CLIP and RNAseq data from the emetine treatment experiment are presented. Experiments on 293S cells +/- emetine treatment, in 1 biological replicate.

The application of toxicogenomics as a predictive tool for chemical risk assessment has been under evaluation by the toxicology community for more than a decade. However, toxicogenomics predominately remains a tool for investigative research rather than for regulatory risk assessment. In this study, we aimed to determine whether the current generation of microarray technology in combination with an in vitro experimental design was capable of generating robust, reproducible data of sufficient quality to show promise as a tool for regulatory risk assessment. To this end, we designed a prospective collaborative study to determine the level of inter- and intra-laboratory reproducibility between three independent laboratories. All test sites adopted the same protocols for all aspects of the toxicogenomic experiment including cell culture, chemical exposure, RNA extraction, microarray data generation and analysis. As a case study, the genotoxic carcinogen B[a]P and the human hepatocyte cell line HepG2 were used to generate three comparable toxicogenomic data sets. High levels of technical reproducibility were demonstrated using a widely employed gene expression microarray platform. While differences at the global transcriptome level were still observed between the test sites, a common subset of B[a]P responsive genes was identified across all test sites which included both genes previously reported in the literature as B[a]P responsive in addition to the same most highly up and down regulated genes. Pending further analysis, these preliminary data show promise that the current generation of microarray technology in combination with a standard in vitro experimental design can produce robust data that can be reproducibly generated in independent laboratories. Future work will need to determine whether in vitro model(s) can be not only reproducible but also predictive for a range of toxic chemicals with different mechanisms of action. Such an approach may potentially be part of future in vitro testing regimes for regulatory risk assessment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inter- and intra-laboratory reproducibility of toxicogenomics data for toxicity testing in a regulatory setting. 3 Test Centres performed the same experimental protocol treating HepG2 cells with 3 mM Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) (in 0.5% DMSO) for 24 hours prior to RNA extraction and microarray analysis.

The a-isoform of ChoK has an essential role in growth control and signal transduction and it has been implicated in the carcinogenic process. Aim of the study is the evaluation of the biological relevance of ChoK expression and activity to define its possible role as a non-invasively detectable EOC biomarker and druggable target. We specifically silenced ChoKa expression by transient RNA interference in two different EOC cell lines and evaluated the biological effects related to metabolic profiles, cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation and alteration of global gene expression to possibly identify new pathways implicated in altered choline metabolism. Following ChoKa silencing we observed a 70% reduction of mRNA and protein expression with a similar reduction in PCho accumulation as assessed by HMRS analysis. The ChoKa silencing was accompanied by 20% inhibition of cell growth and similar percentage of cells blocked in the G1-phase of cell cycle. No alteration in cell morphology and modulation of the main survival signaling pathways (PI3K and MAPK-related signaling) were observed. By gene expression analysis we found 476 differentially expressed genes (p< 0.01; FDR 25%) in silenced cells. By transcriptome analysis of CHKA silenced cells as compared to controls, among the most relevant co-repressed genes we found CyclinA, related to regulation of cell cycle progression, and cytokines genes (IL-6 and IL-8) related to inflammation and EOC aggressiveness. Acyl-CoA synthetase medium-chain family member 3 (ACSM3), phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 (PPAP2A) and Osteoprotegerin were among the most up-regulated genes.

Ingenuity System Pathways Analysis (IPA) identified a network of molecules most significantly affected by CHKA silencing whose main functions is related to cell morphology cellular assembly and organization, cellular function and maintenance.

Mammalian interphase chromosomes interact with the nuclear lamina (NL) through hundreds of large Lamina Associated Domains (LADs). We report a method to map NL contacts genome-wide in single human cells. Analysis of ~400 maps reveals a core architecture of gene-poor LADs that contact the NL with high cell-to-cell consistency, interspersed by LADs with more variable NL interactions. The variable contacts are more sensitive to a change in genome ploidy than the consistent contacts. Single-cell maps indicate that NL contacts involve multivalent interactions over hundreds of kilobases. Moreover, we observe extensive intra-chromosomal coordination of NL contacts, even over tens of megabases. Such coordinated loci exhibit preferential interactions as detected by Hi-C. Finally, single-cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility analysis shows that loci with consistent NL contacts are expressed at lower levels and are more consistently inaccessible than loci with lower contact frequencies. These results highlight fundamental principles of single cell chromatin organization. In this dataset, single-cell mRNA sequencing results from 96 single KBM7 cells have been deposited.",

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) hold great promise for in vitro disease modeling and cell replacement therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). Both applications crucially require an in-depth profiling of the disease-relevant, iPSC-derived cell type. Midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons derived from pluripotent stem cells are of substantial interest because of their instrumental value for PD therapy. IPSC-derived mDA neuron-like cells have been generated, however, detailed genetic and epigenetic characterization of strictly purified in vitro generated DA neurons has so far lagged behind. We generated mouse Pitx3gfp/+ iPSC-derived DA neurons that, after fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) allowed comprehensive comparison to mesodiencephalic dopaminergic (mdDA) neurons from Fac-sorted Pitx3gfp/+ ventral midbrains. We performed detailed analysis of global gene expression and genome-scale DNA methylation of CpG islands (CGIs) by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. The reprogramming pathway from fibroblasts to iPSCs left parental cell footprints for both gene expression and DNA methylation. However, most gene expression patterns of iPSC-derived DA neurons closely resembled that of primary mdDA neurons with the strongest correlations for mdDA specific genes. Also, for DNA methylation patterns, high similarities were found for the vast majority of CGIs when comparing primary mdDA neurons with iPSC-derived DA neurons. Additionally, we found de novo DNA methylation during in vitro differentiation for hundreds of genes specifically in lineage-committed neural precursors that persisted in iPSC-derived DA neurons. Our study provides novel detailed characteristics of iPSC-derived DA neurons in comparison to the primary cell type. These findings add important information to our knowledge about these biomedically highly valuable, in vitro generated neurons. Microarray expression study comparing 3 samples of facs-sorted, Pitx3-gfp positive cells from each experimental group to a common reference consisting of adult mouse midbrain RNA.

Exposure to serious or traumatic events early in life can lead to persistent alterations in physiological stress response systems, including enhanced cross-talk between the neuroendocrine and immune system. These programming effects may be mechanistically involved in mediating the effects of adverse childhood experience on disease risk in adulthood. Here, we investigated neuroendocrine as well as genome-wide mRNA expression responses in monocytes to acute stress exposure, in a sample of healthy adults (n=30) with a history of early childhood adversity, and a control group (n=30) without trauma experience. The early adversity group showed altered hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses to stress, evidenced by lower ACTH and cortisol responses. Analyses of gene expression patterns showed a larger stress-induced increase of cardinal pro-inflammatory transcripts IL6 and FOSB, and an increased activity of pro-inflammatory upstream signaling in the early adversity group. We also identified transcripts that were differentially correlated with stress-induced cortisol increases between the groups. Noteworthy, FKBP5 expression was less responsive to cortisol induction in the early adversity group, with potential effects on the ultra-short feedback loop that balances FKBP5 and glucocorticoid receptor activity. Further exploratory analyses showed differential stress-induced regulation of gene transcription between the groups. Prominent among the differentially regulated transcripts were those coding for genes involved in signal transducer activity, G-protein coupled receptors, and several genes involved in serotonin receptor signaling. We suggest that childhood adversity leads to persistent alterations in transcriptional control of stress responsive pathways, which - when chronically or repeatedly activated - might predispose individuals to stress-related psychopathology. 180 samples were analyzed. 60 healthy adults (30 with history of childhood adversiy, 30 controls without trauma history) were subjected to a standardized laboratory stress protocol. Blood samples for the isolation of CD14+ monocytes were taken at 45 before, and at 45 and 180 minutes post stress.",

To do this, we generated Tet-On inducible lines that express either the human (P1) HNF4a2 or (P2) HNF4a8 under control of DOX in the HCT116 human colon cancer cells. Methods: HNF4a2 and Parental lines were induced with 0.3 mg/mL DOX, while HNF4a8 line was induced with either 0.1 or 0.3 mg/mL DOX for 24 hours. Samples were generated by deep sequencing, using the Illumina TruSeq RNA. Result: There were common and unique dysregulated genes identified in the HNF4a2 and HNF4a8 lines (+DOX); more upregulated genes than downregulated genes in both the lines.

    "text": "Hypoxic regulation of gene expression is dominated by the HIF system and can be mimicked by DMOG. The response of cells to hypoxia is characterised by co-ordinated regulation of many genes. Studies of the regulation of the expression of many of these genes by oxygen has implicated a role for the heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). The mechanism of oxygen sensing which controls this heterodimeric factor is via oxygen dependent prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation by specific 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases (PHD1, PHD2, PHD3 and FIH-1). Whilst HIF appears to have a major role in hypoxic regulation of gene expression, it is unclear to what extent other transcriptional mechanisms are also involved in the response to hypoxia. The extent to which 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases are responsible for the oxygen sensing mechanism in HIF-independent hypoxic gene regulation is also unclear. Both the prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylases can be inhibited by dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG). Such inhibition can produce activation of the HIF system with enhanced transcription of target genes and might have a role in the therapy of ischaemic disease. We have examined the extent to which the HIF system contributes to the regulation of gene expression by hypoxia, to what extent 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase inhibitor can mimic the hypoxic response and the nature of the global transcriptional response to hypoxia. We have utilised microarray assays of mRNA abundance to examine the gene expression changes in response to hypoxia and to DMOG. We demonstrate a large number of hypoxically regulated genes, both known and novel, and find a surprisingly high level of mimicry of the hypoxic response by use of the 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase inhibitor, dimethyloxalylglycine. We have also used microarray analysis of cells treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha to demonstrate the differing contributions of each transcription factor to the transcriptional response to hypoxia. Candidate transcripts were confirmed using an independent microarray platform and real-time PCR. The results emphasise the critical role of the HIF system in the hypoxic response, whilst indicating the dominance of HIF-1alpha and defining genes that only respond to HIF-2alpha.Keywords: Hypoxia response, gene knockdown, chemical treatment.

In total, 7 different types of sample were analysed by microarray technology. These were: 'normoxia' - cells grown in normoxic (21% oxygen) conditions; 'hypoxia' - cells grown in hypoxic conditions (1% oxygen) for 16 hours; 'DMOG' - cells grown in normoxic conditions and exposed to the 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine, DMOG (2 mM) for 16 hours; 'OF' - cells grown in hypoxic conditions as above and exposed to oligofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen) alone; 'HIF1' - cells grown in hypoxic conditions as above and exposed to HIF-1alpha siRNA; 'HIF2' - cells grown in the same hypoxic conditions with HIF-2alpha siRNA and 'HIF12' - cells grown in the same hypoxic conditions with both HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha siRNA. Three independent samples were analysed for each experimental condition.

HSP90 inhibitors are promising new anticancer agents, in which the benzoquinone ansamycin 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) is currently in clinical evaluation. However, the implications of acquired resistance to this class of drug remain largely unexplored. In the present study, we have generated isogenic human colonic cancer cell line SW480 that is resistant to 17-AAG by continued culturing in the compound.We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the acquired resistance to 17-AAG in SW480 and SW480-R cell lines. SW480 cells were incubated and treated with 17-AAG at an initial concentration of 1xIC50. The medium with the compound was replaced every 48 h to discard dead cells. When surviving cells grow to 80% confluence, cells were passaged and the 17-AAG concentration was then added as follows: 2x, 4x, 6x ......IC50 till undulated. The generated resistant cell line(SW480-R) was cultured without 17-AAG at least of 2 weeks for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays, and for other analysis. Paired parental cells in another flask were serially passaged without 17-AAG as an untreated control.",

Cells adapt to environmental changes, including fluctuations in oxygen levels, through the induction of specific gene expression programs. To identify genes regulated by hypoxia at the transcriptional level, we pulse-labeled HUVEC cells with 4-thiouridine and sequenced nascent transcripts. Then, we searched genome-wide binding profiles from the ENCODE project for factors that correlated with changes in transcription and identified binding of several components of the Sin3A co-repressor complex, including SIN3A, SAP30 and HDAC1/2, proximal to genes repressed by hypoxia. SIN3A interference revealed that it participates in the downregulation of 75% of the hypoxia-repressed genes in endothelial cells. Unexpectedly, it also blunted the induction of 47% of the upregulated genes, suggesting a role for this corepressor in gene induction. In agreement, ChIP-seq experiments showed that SIN3A preferentially localizes to the promoter region of actively transcribed genes and that SIN3A signal was enriched in hypoxia-repressed genes, prior exposure to the stimulus. Importantly, SINA3 occupancy was not altered by hypoxia in spite of changes in H3K27ac signal. In summary, our results reveal a prominent role for SIN3A in the transcriptional response to hypoxia and suggest a model where modulation of the associated histone deacetylase activity, rather than its recruitment, determines the transcriptional output. Exponentially growing non-synchronized HUVEC were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia (21% or 1% oxygen respectively) for 8 hours and pulse-labelled with 4-thiouridine during the last two hours of treatment. RNA was extracted from samples in each condition (total RNA) and an aliquot was subjected to affinity chromatography to purify the 4-thiouridine-labelled (newly transcribed RNA, Newly Tr) and non-labelled (Pre-existent) RNA fractions. All three RNA fractions (total, newly transcribed and pre-existent) from each sample were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing.

Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is a winged helix transcription factor that plays roles in control and stressed conditions by gaining access to target elements, but mechanisms of HSF1 access have not been well known in mammalian cells. We show a physical interaction between the wing motif of human HSF1 and replication protein A (RPA), which is involved in DNA metabolism. Depletion of RPA1 abolishes HSF1 access to the promoter of HSP70 in unstressed conditions, and delays its rapid activation in response to heat shock. The HSF1-RPA complex leads preloading of RNA polymerase II and opens chromatin structure by recruiting a histone chaperone FACT. Furthermore, this interaction is required for melanoma cell proliferation. These results provide a mechanistic basis for constitutive HSF1 access to nucleosomal DNA, which is important for both basal and inducible gene expression. To examine whether the HSF1-RPA complex regulates the expression of genes, mRNA levels in MEFs with/without HSF1- or RPA1-shRNA were analyzed by DNA microarray analysis using GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix).",

A major task in analyzing alternative splicing (AS) by RNA-Seq is to explore and quantify the differential representation of various splice classes and the protein-coding potential of the mapped reads. To this end, we have generated a streamlined bioinformatic pipeline available to the scientific community, which maps RNA-Seq reads to a complex combinatorial database of exon-exon junctions for the unique junction discovery, PTC detection and identification of splice isoforms. Hence, we have incorporated a splice isoform inference and PTC detection algorithm, which facilitates a highly accurate mapping and prediction of splice isoform junctions and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)-susceptibility. We used this pipeline to investigate the complexity of the transcriptome and global role of AS-NMD in vivo in mammalian cells, by taking advantage of our Upf2 conditional knock-out mouse. Using tissue-specific Cre deleter strains, we have previously demonstrated in vivo that NMD acts to degrade many transcripts that results from AS. Also, ablating UPF2 (a core NMD factor) in the mouse leads to rapid mortality and collapse of most organs tested (Thoren et al., 2010; Weischenfeldt et al., 2008), suggesting an essential function for NMD in AS. To explore the effect of NMD on global splicing and to generate and validate an attractive bioinformatic pipeline for the scientific community to study AS and NMD, we chose to analyze two different mammalian organ systems with distinct phenotypes upon UPF2 ablation to test the robustness and dynamic range of the analysis. In one end of the spectrum, we chose to analyze the liver, wherein removal of UPF2 results in failure in liver metabolism and a high mortality rate (Thoren et al., 2010). To profile a less affected tissue, we chose to analyze bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). These are macrophages that differentiate in vitro and Upf2 deleted BMMs are completely devoid of NMD activity but nevertheless show no morphological or functional phenotype compared to wild-type controls (Weischenfeldt et al., 2008). Thus, we were able to make a direct comparison between these two tissues to demonstrate the potency of our Isoform and PTC detection pipeline described below, which will allow the scientific community to analyze transcriptome data for global AS and NMD-susceptibility.

We generated a new transgenic mouse model in which CD4+ T cells recognize a novel epitope in tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP-1), an antigen that is expressed by normal melanocytes and B16 murine melanoma.

TRIM33 is identified here as a lineage dependency in B cell neoplasms and is shown to perform this essential function by associating with a single cis element. ChIP-seq analysis of TRIM33 in murine B cell leukemia revealed a preferential association with two lineage-specific enhancers that harbor an exceptional density of motifs recognized by the PU.1 transcription factor. TRIM33 is recruited to these elements by PU.1, yet acts to antagonize PU.1 function. One of the PU.1/TRIM33 co-occupied enhancers is upstream of the pro-apoptotic gene Bim, and deleting this enhancer renders TRIM33 dispensable for leukemia cell survival.

Treatment of many pathologies of the brain could be improved markedly by the development of non-invasive therapeutic approaches that elicit robust, endothelial cell-selective, gene expression in specific brain regions that are targeted under MR image-guidance. While focused ultrasound (FUS) in conjunction with gas-filled microbubbles (MBs) has emerged as a non-invasive modality for MR image-guided gene delivery to the brain, it has been used exclusively to transiently disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which may induce a sterile inflammation response. Here, we introduce a new MR image-guided FUS method that elicits endothelial-selective transfection of the cerebral vasculature (i.e. \"sonoselective\" transfection), without opening the BBB. We first determined that activating circulating, cationic plasmid-bearing, MBs with pulsed low-pressure (0.1 MPa) 1.1 MHz FUS facilitates sonoselective gene delivery to the endothelium without MRI-detectable disruption of the BBB. The degree of endothelial selectivity varied inversely with the FUS pressure, with higher pressures (i.e. 0.3 MPa and 0.4 MPa FUS) consistently inducing BBB opening and extravascular transfection. Bulk RNA sequencing analyses revealed that the sonoselective low pressure regimen does not upregulate inflammatory or immune responses. Single cell RNA sequencing indicated that the transcriptome of sonoselectively transfected brain endothelium was unaffected by the treatment. The approach developed here permits targeted gene delivery to blood vessels and could be used to promote angiogenesis, release endothelial cell-secreted factors to stimulate nerve regrowth, or recruit neural stem cells. Groups of 3 - 4 mice were treated with 0.1 MPa, 0.2 MPa, 0.4 MPa, or 0.0 MPa (Anesthesia + Cationic microbubbles only) for harvest at both 6 h and 24 h post treatment, for a total of 8 groups.

Among the genes upregulated, we identified a interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) signature include SIGLEC-1. We confirmed SIGLEC-1 and other five ISG genes by qPCR, FACS and western blot. Human macrophages were diffentiated from freshly isolated monocytes treated with M-CSF and conditioned media. Conditioned media was generated from Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected (coMtb) or non-infected (coCtrl) macrophages. Upon confirmation of the M(IL-10) macrophage phenotype induced by coMtb, and susceptbility to HIV-1 infectiion, the transcriptome analyses was performed in these conditioned cells from four independent donors.",

Lyme disease is challenging to diagnose, as clinical manifestations are variable and current tools to detect nucleic acid or antibody responses from Borrelia burgdorferi infection have low sensitivity. Here we conducted the first study of the global transcriptome of patients with Lyme disease to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers. Twenty-nine patients were enrolled and compared to 13 healthy controls at three time points after infection. Fifteen publicly available transcriptome datasets from patients in vivo or infection models in vitro were used to assess specificity of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We found that Lyme disease results in profound and sustained changes in the patient transcriptomes, with a specific signature that shares <=44% DEGs with other infections. . Gene expression profile from peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMC) of Lyme disease patients against healthy controls was undertaken. A total of 29 Lyme disease patients were sampled at 3 time points: acute Lyme pre-treatment (V1), 3 weeks later, immediately following completion of a standard course of antibiotics (V2), and 6 months following treatment completion (V5). 13 healthy controls were also sampled at one time point. Total RNA was extracted from 10e7 PBMC, followed by mRNA purification, paired-end barcode library preparation and sequencing on an Illumina Hiseq 2000.",

Rationale: The acute respiratory distress syndrome is refractory to pharmacological intervention. Inappropriate activation of alveolar neutrophils is believed to underpin this disease's complex pathophysiology, yet these cells have been little studied.Objectives: To examine the functional and transcriptional profiles of patient blood and alveolar neutrophils compared to healthy volunteer cells, and define their sensitivity to phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibition.Methods: Twenty three ventilated patients underwent bronchoalveolar lavage. Alveolar and blood neutrophil apoptosis, phagocytosis and adhesion molecules were quantified by flow cytometry, and oxidase responses by chemiluminescence. Cytokine and transcriptional profiling utilized multiplex and GeneChip arrays.Measurements and Main Results: Patient blood and alveolar neutrophils were distinct from healthy circulating cells, with increased CD11b and reduced CD62L expression, delayed apoptosis and constitutively primed oxidase responses. Incubating control cells with disease bronchoalveolar lavage recapitulated the aberrant functional phenotype and this could be reversed by phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors. In contrast, the pro-survival phenotype of patient cells was recalcitrant to phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibition. RNA transcriptomic analysis revealed modified immune, cytoskeletal and cell death pathways in patient cells, aligning closely to sepsis and burns data sets but not with phosphoinositide 3-kinase signatures.Conclusions: Acute respiratory distress syndrome blood and alveolar neutrophils display a distinct primed, pro-survival profile and transcriptional signature. The enhanced respiratory burst was phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent, but delayed apoptosis and the altered transcriptional profile were not. These unexpected findings cast doubt over the utility of phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibition in acute respiratory distress syndrome and highlight the importance of evaluating novel therapeutic strategies in patient-derived cells. 94 samples in total.

Dppa4 (Developmental pluripotency-associated 4) has been identified in several highprofile screens as a gene that is expressed exclusively in pluripotent cells. It encodes a nuclear protein with a SAP-like domain and appears to be associated preferentially with transcriptionally active chromatin. Its exquisite expression pattern and results of RNA interference experiments have led to speculation that Dppa4, as well as its nearby homolog Dppa2, might play essential roles in embryonic stem cell function and/or germ cell development. To rigorously assess suggested roles, we have generated Dppa4-deficient and Dppa4/Dppa2 double-deficient ES cells, as well as mice lacking Dppa4. Contrary to predictions, we find that Dppa4 is completely dispensable for ES cell identity and germ cell development. Instead, loss of Dppa4 in mice results in late embryonic/peri-natal death and striking skeletal defects with partial penetrance. Thus, surprisingly, Dppa4-deficiency affects tissues, which never transcribed the gene, and at least some loss-of-function defects manifest phenotypically at an embryonic stage long after physiologic Dppa4 expression has ceased. Concomitant with targeted gene inactivation, we have introduced into the Dppa4 locus a red fluorescent marker (tandem-dimer RFP), which is compatible with GFP-based proteins and allows non-invasive visualization of pluripotent cells and reprogramming events.

Tumor cells that give rise to metastatic disease are a primary cause of cancer-related death and have not been fully elucidated in patients with lung cancer. Here, we addressed this question by using tissues from a mouse that develops metastatic lung adenocarcinoma owing to expression of mutant K-ras and p53. We identified a metastasis-prone population of tumor cells that differed from those with low metastatic capacity on the basis of having sphere-forming capacity in Matrigel cultures, increased expression of CD133 and Notch ligands, and relatively low tumorigenicity in syngeneic mice. Knockdown of jagged1 or pharmacologic inhibition of its downstream mediator phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase abrogated the metastatic but not the tumorigenic activity of these cells. We conclude from these studies on a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma that CD133 and Notch ligands mark a population of metastasis-prone tumor cells and that the efficacy of Notch inhibitors in metastasis prevention should be explored.Keywords: two group comparison. 344SQ subcutaneous tumors (from a lung adenocarcinoma cell line derived from a KrasLA1/+; p53R172HdelG/+ mouse that metastasizes widely following subcutaneous injection into syngeneic mice) were sorted by flow cytometry into CD133high and CD133low fractions.

Cell differentiation is an essential process of normal development by which a stem cell or progenitor cell becomes a post-mitotic, specialized cell with unique morphology and function. Also, it has long been recognized that differentiation is associated with a marked reduction in DNA damage response at the global level. The molecular basis for the coordination between cell cycle exit, acquirement of specialized structure and function, and attenuation of DNA damage response during differentiation is not well understood. We have conducted a genome-wide analysis of the HOXC9-induced neuronal differentiation program in human neuroblastoma cells. Gene expression profiling reveals that HOXC9-induced differentiation is associated with transcriptional regulation of 2,395 genes, which is characterized by global upregulation of neuronal genes and downregulation of cell cycle and DNA repair genes. Remarkably, genome-wide mapping demonstrates that HOXC9 occupies 40% of these genes, including a large number of genes involved in neuronal differentiation, cell cycle progression and DNA damage response. These findings suggest that HOXC9 directly activates and represses the transcription of distinct sets of genes to coordinate the cellular events characteristic of neuronal differentiation.

Genetic mutations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with critical roles have been well examined. The recent discovery of alterations in genes encoding histone modifiers suggests their possible roles in the complexity of cancer development. We previously reported loss of heterozygosity of the KDM6B gene, which encodes a histone demethylase for trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a repressive chromatin mark, in PDAC cells. In this study, we demonstrated that loss of KDM6B enhanced aggressiveness of PDAC cells. KDM6B has been regarded as a tumor suppressor that mediates oncogenic KRAS-induced senescence. Consistently, KDM6B was highly expressed in pancreatic precancerous lesions (pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms); then, the expression decreased as the malignant grade progressed. We found that knockdown of KDM6B in PDAC cells promoted tumor sphere formation and increased peritoneal dissemination and liver metastasis in vivo. Microarray and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis implicated CEBPA for aggressiveness induced by KDM6B knockdown. CEBPA knockdown recapitulated the phenotypic change of PDAC cells after KDM6B knockdown, which was reversed by forced expression of C/EBPa. Moreover, similar protein expression patterns of KDM6B and C/EBPa in human PDAC emphasized their functional correlation. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of the H3K27 methylase EZH2 in PDAC cells inhibited tumor sphere formation along with the upregulation of CEBPA expression, and this effect was impaired in KDM6B knockdown cells, highlighting the role for KDM6B in the activation of CEBPA. Together, our results propose a significant role for the KDM6B-C/EBPa axis in the PDAC phenotype. To identify genes regulated by JMJD3/KDM6B in pancreatic cancer, transcriptional profiling of BxPC3 cells transfected with either control vector or shKDM6B-expressing vector was performed using whole human genome microarrays.

Here, we show that in contrast to its oncogenic effect in preleukemia state and lymphoid malignancies, JMJD3 relieves the differentiation-arrest of certain subtypes (such as M2 and M3) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. RNA-sequencing and ChIP-PCR analyses revealed that JMJD3 exerts anti-AML effect by directly modulating H3K4 and H3K27 methylation levels to activate the expression of a number of key myelopoietic regulatory genes. Mechanistic exploration identified a physical and functional association of JMJD3 with C/EBPb that presides the regulatory network of JMJD3. Thus, the leukemia regulatory role of JMJD3 varies in a disease phase- and lineage-dependent manner, and acts as a potential oncorepressor in certain subsets of AML largely by coupling to C/EBPb-centered myelopoietic program.This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

Recently, our and other's studies revealed that IRF4 involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy, cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury and metabolic disorder. However, the function of IRF4 in VSMC and neointima formation was largely unknown. We found that IRF4 expression was dramatically decreased in the VSMCs of mouse carotid artery. More importantly, using global IRF4 deficient mouse (KO), we demonstrated that IRF4 deficiency significantly increased VSMC proliferation, migration and neointima formation compared with wild type mice (WT) in response to injury. To evaluate the underlying mechanism by which IRF4 promotes VSMC proliferation and migration after vascular injury, IRF4 KO and WT mice were subjected to wire-injury and the carotid arteries were collected at 14 days post-injury. We combined 3-5 vessels for one sample, and 3 samples for each phenotype. Subsequently, a total of 400ng RNA was used following Affymetrix instruction and 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45deg. GeneChips were scanned using the Scanner 7G and the data was analyzed with Expression Console using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. RMA analysis was employed to evaluate the gene expression.We used microarrays to detect the global gene expression in the carotid arteries of IRF4 knockout mice (IRF4 KO) compared with wild type mice (WT) at 14 days post-injury and identified distinct classes of altered genes. Wild type (WT) and global IRF4 knockout mice (IRF4 KO) were subjected to wire-injury and the carotid ateries were collected at 14 days post-injury. We combine 3-5 vessels in one tube and for a single Affymetrix microarray. Total RNA was extracted and a total of 400ng RNA was used following Affymetrix instruction. 3 biological samples for each genotype.",

The transcriptional regulator EVI1 has an essential role in early hematopoiesis and development. However, aberrantly high expression of EVI1 has potent oncogenic properties and confers poor prognosis and chemo-resistance in leukemia and solid tumors. To investigate to what extent EVI1 function might be regulated by posttranslational modifications, we carried out mass spectrometry- and antibody-based analyses and uncovered an ATM-mediated double phosphorylation of EVI1 at the carboxy-terminal S858/S860 SQS motif. In the presence of genotoxic stress, EVI1-WT (SQS), but not site mutated EVI1-AQA was able to maintain transcriptional patterns and transformation potency, while under standard conditions carboxy-terminal mutation had no effect. Maintenance of hematopoietic progenitor cell clonogenic potential was profoundly impaired with EVI1-AQA compared with EVI1-WT, in particular in the presence of genotoxic stress. Exploring mechanistic events underlying these observations, we showed that after genotoxic stress EVI1-WT, but not EVI1-AQA increased its level of association with its functionally essential interaction partner CtBP1, implying a role for ATM in regulating EVI1 protein interactions via phosphorylation. This aspect of EVI1 regulation is therapeutically relevant, as chemotherapy-induced genotoxicity might detrimentally sustain EVI1 function via stress response mediated phosphorylation, and ATM-inhibition might be of specific targeted benefit in EVI1-overexpressing malignancies. Poly-A RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis of EVI1-mediated modulation of gene expression RNA was extracted from HEK293 cells, which were subjected to transient transfection using half confluent cultures with pCMV-flag, pCMV-EVI1-WT-flag or pCMV-EVI1-AQA-flag, exposed to 150 mM H2O2 or left untreated for 8 h.",

Neuroinflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, are characterized by invasion of the brain by autoreactive T cells. The mechanism for how T cells acquire their encephalitogenic phenotype and trigger disease remains, however, unclear. The existence of lymphatic vessels in the meninges indicates a relevant link between the CNS and peripheral immune system, perhaps affecting autoimmunity. Here we demonstrate that meningeal lymphatics fulfill two critical criteria: they assist in the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid components and enable immune cells to enter draining lymph nodes in a CCR7-dependent manner. Unlike other tissues, meningeal lymphatic endothelial cells do not undergo expansion during inflammation, and they express a unique transcriptional signature. Notably, the ablation of meningeal lymphatics diminishes pathology and reduces the inflammatory response of brain-reactive T cells during an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Our findings demonstrate that meningeal lymphatics govern inflammatory processes and immune surveillance of the CNS and pose a valuable target for therapeutic intervention. Adult C57Bl6 mice were injected with 2D2 tdTOMATO T cells prior to meningeal lymphatic ablation (VIS) or control (PBS). EAE was induced with MOG(35-55).

The peri- and postmenopausal periods in women are associated with decreases in circulating estrogen levels, marked acceleration of age-related bone loss and increased risk of fracture. However, despite the clinical importance of postmenopausal bone loss, our molecular understanding of this process is incomplete. Here, we used co-expression network analysis to gain novel insight into the molecular mechanisms mediating bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) mice, a model of human menopause. Expression profiles from intact and OVX mice from a panel of inbred strains were used to generate a co-expression network consisting of 29 modules. Genes in network module 25 were decreased by OVX in all strains. Module 25 was enriched for genes involved in the response to oxidative stress, a process known to be an upstream causal factor for OVX-induced bone loss. It was also found that module 25 homologs were co-expressed in human bone marrow and were enriched for genes with evidence of genetic association with bone mineral density (BMD) in women. Alpha synuclein (Snca) was the most highly connected \"hub\" genes in module 25 and its in vivo knockout resulted in a 40% reduction in OVX-induced bone loss. Furthermore, protection was associated with the targeted alteration of genes in specific network modules, including module 10. Our results identify a gene module associated with OVX-induced bone loss and demonstrate that Snca regulates ovariectomy-induced bone loss by controlling bone network dynamics. Lumbar verebrae (L5) were isolated from Snca wild-type and global knockout four-weeks post SHAM surgery or ovariectomies (OVX). A total of 16 samples were profiled (N=4/genotype/surgical group).",

    "text": "The influence of transcript assembly on the proteogenomics discovery of microproteins. Proteogenomics methods have identified many non-annotated protein-coding genes in the human genome. Many of the newly discovered protein-coding genes encode peptides and small proteins, referred to collectively as microproteins. Microproteins are produced through ribosome translation of small open reading frames (smORFs). The discovery of many smORFs reveals a blind spot in traditional gene-finding algorithms for these genes. Biological studies have found roles for microproteins in cell biology and physiology, and the potential that there exists additional bioactive microproteins drives the interest in detection and discovery of these molecules. A key step in any proteogenomics workflow is the assembly of RNA-Seq data into likely mRNA transcrips that are then used to create a searchable protein databases. Here we demonstrate that specific features of the assembled transcriptome impact microprotein detection by shotgun proteomics. By tailoring transcript assembly for downstream mass spectrometry searching, we show that we can detect more than double the number of high-quality microprotein candidates and introduce a novel open-source mRNA assembler for proteogenomics (MAPS) that incorporates all of these features. By integrating our specialized assembler, MAPS, and a popular generalized assembler into our proteogenomics pipeline, we detect 45 novel human microproteins from a high quality proteogenomics dataset of a human cell line. We then characterize the features of the novel microproteins, identifying two classes of microproteins. Our work highlights the importance of specialized transcriptome assembly upstream of proteomics validation when searching for short and potentially rare and poorly conserved proteins. .

The development of affinity purification technologies together with mass spectrometric analyses of the purified protein mixtures (AP-MS) has been used both to identify new protein-protein interactions and to define the subunit composition of protein complexes. Transcription factor protein interactions, however, have not been systematically analyzed using these approaches. Here, we have investigated whether ectopic expression of an affinity tagged transcription factor as bait in AP-MS experiments perturbs gene expression in cells resulting in false positive identification of bait associated proteins when typical experimental controls are used. Using quantitative proteomics and RNA-Seq, we determined that the increase in the abundance of a set of proteins caused by overexpression of the transcription factor RelA is not sufficient for these proteins to then copurify non-specifically and be misidentified as bait associated proteins. Therefore typical controls should be sufficient and a number of different baits can be compared with a common set of controls. This is of practical interest when identifying bait interactors from a large number of different baits. As expected, we found several known RelA interactors enriched in our RelA purifications (NFeB1, NFeB2, Rel, RelB, IeBa, IeBa and IeBa). We also found several proteins not previously described in association with RelA, including the small mitochondrial chaperone Tim13. Using a variety of biochemical approaches, we further investigated the nature of the association between Tim13 and NFeB family transcription factors. The work here therefore provides a conceptual and experimental framework for analyzing transcription faction protein interactions.

Dengue is one of the most important arboviruses in the world, with 2.5 billion people living in areas under risk to contagious. Mosquitos from Aedes genus is the transmission vector of viral particles.The virus genome inserted in these particles is formed by a single strain of RNA molecule which codifies three structural (C, prM, and E proteins) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5).The NS3 protein is involved in viral replication, with helicase (NS3hell) and protease functions. Once inoculated, the primary target for dengue virus (DV) infection is the Dendritic Cells (DC) in the site of mosquitos bit.The Dendritic Cells is the most efficient antigen-presenting cell holding the connection of innate immune system with adaptive immune system. In this study we examined the response of human monocyte-derived DC (mdDCs) DV-infected with two different strains how contain a single point mutation in L435S or L480S position of NS3hell protein, named vBAC-NS3435 and vBAC-NS3480 respectively.The analysis of these results demonstrated that the mutated strains can infect more efficiently the mdDCs compared with parental virus (vBACDV1) with more percentage of cells infected, replication and virus progeny.Infections of mdDCs with mutated DV can induce a differentiated response in gene profile of theses cells, with up-regulation of IFN Signaling and PRR canonical pathways. In the PRR pathway the expression of TLR3 and TLR7 was determined and these seem to be the route of sensing of the ssRNA-virus for the infected mdDCs. These sensing of the DV by mdDCs is translated in production of Type I IFN.The Type I IFN production was more important in mdDC DV-infected with mutated strains compared with parental strain. However, the enhanced levels of Type I IFN production were unable to prevent mdDCs infection by mutated strains.A18:J192replication. In the absence of Type I IFN action, the percentage of mdDCs infected by mutated strains was significantly incremented compared with DV-infection in the presence of Type I IFN, demonstrating that the Type I IFN action was effective but not sufficient to prevent viral replication of mutated strains. The single point mutation in NS3hell protein of vBAC-NS3435 and vBAC-NS3480 are sufficient to enhance the replication and bypass the Type I IFN action. All these results together can demonstrated that the single point mutation in a NS3hel protein of DV can subvert the normal replication pathway of the virus and these change can't by controlled by human mdDC production of Type I IFN. In this study we analyzed the mRNA pool of 10 cultures. Each culture was infected with MOI of 5.0, and the cells were extracted at the times points of 8, 24, and 48 hours after infection.As infection control, the same 10 cultures were mock-infected.

Understanding the response of memory CD8 T cells to persistent antigen re-stimulation and the role of CD4 T cell help is critical to the design of successful vaccines for chronic diseases. However, studies comparing the protective abilities and qualities of memory and naive cells have been mostly performed in acute infections, and little is known about their roles during chronic infections. Herein, we show that memory cells dominate over naive cells and are protective when present in large enough numbers to quickly reduce infection. In contrast, when infection is not rapidly reduced, memory cells are quickly lost, unlike naive cells. This loss of memory cells is due to (i) an early block in cell proliferation, (ii) selective regulation by the inhibitory receptor 2B4, and (iii) increased reliance on CD4 T cell help. These findings have important implications towards the design of T cell vaccines against chronic infections and tumors. 16 samples are analyzed: 3 replicates of secondary effector CD8 P14 T cells at day 8 post-acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection; 4 replicates of secondary effector CD8 P14 T cells at day 8 post-chronic LCMV infection; 4 replicates of primary effector CD8 P14 T cells at day 8 post-acute LCMV infection; and 5 replicates of primary effector CD8 P14 T cells at day 8 post-chronic LCMV infection.",

Mucispirillum schaedleri is an abundant inhabitant of the intestinal mucus layer of rodents and other animals. To gain insights into its lifestyle, we analyzed the genome and transcriptome of M. schaedleri ASF 457 and tested for traits predicted by the genome using physiological experiments. Although thought to be a mucus degrader, its genome surprisingly predicts that M. schaedleri has limited capacity for degrading host-derived mucosal glycans or other complex polysaccharides. Rather, it may utilize small compounds such as peptides, amino acids, glycerol, and short chain fatty acids. Additionally, it can reduce nitrate and has systems for scavenging oxygen and reactive oxygen species, which accounts for its presence close to the mucosal tissue and during inflammation. Also of note, M. schaedleri harbors a type VI secretion system (T6SS) and several putative effector proteins containing eukaryotic domains, which suggest intimate interactions with the host and a role in inflammation. Examination of the individual phylogenies of all genes in the M. schaedleri genome revealed extensive horizontal gene transfer, primarily from intestinal Epsilon- and Deltaproteobacteria. Though M. schaedleri utilizes non-horizontally-transferred pathways (e.g. nitrate reduction), horizontally-acquired pathways from gut organisms (e.g. T6SS and glycerol-P utilization) are also likely also important for its survival in the intestine, suggesting that lateral gene transfer may have played a key role in facilitating its establishment in the gut ecosystem.

PHF8 (PHD Finger 8) mutations have been found in patients with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) and craniofacial deformities. Here we identify PHF8 as the first enzyme that mediates demethylation of mono-methylated histone H4 lysine (K) 20 (H4K20me1), with additional activities towards H3K9me2/1 and H3K27me2. Patient mutations significantly compromise the demethylase activity, indicating functional importance. ChIP-seq identified PHF8 near the transcription start sites (TSS) of over 7000 target genes as well as in gene bodies and intergenic regions. PHF8 depletion resulted in up-regulation of H4K20me1 and H3K9me1 at the TSS-associated sites, and H3K9me2 in the gene bodies and intergenic regions, respectively, demonstrating differential substrate specificities at different target genomic locations. PHF8 depletion at the TSS results in decreased target gene expression, which is coincident with increased occupancy of the protein L3MBTL1 previously shown to induce chromatin compaction via binding to lower methyl states including H4K20me1 and H3K9me1. PHF8 RNAi and control RNAi stable HeLa cell lines were established. RNA were isolated from triplicate cell cultures. RNAs were subject to microarray expression analysis. Hybridizations were performed in duplicate.",

Profound changes in cancer cell identity can alter malignant potential and therapeutic response. Loss of the pulmonary lineage specifier NKX2-1 augments the growth of KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma and causes pulmonary to gastric transdifferentiation. Here we show that the transcription factors FoxA1 and FoxA2 are required for initiation of mucinous NKX2-1-negative lung adenocarcinomas in the mouse and for activation of their gastric differentiation program. Foxa1/2 deletion severely impairs tumor initiation and causes a proximal shift in cellular identity, yielding tumors expressing markers of the squamocolumnar junction of the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, stochastic loss of FoxA1/2 expression in NKX2-1-negative tumors is associated with keratinizing squamous differentiation. Using sequential in vivo recombination, we find that FoxA1/2 loss in established KRAS-driven neoplasia is sufficient for direct induction of keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas in the lung. Thus, NKX2-1, FoxA1 and FoxA2 coordinately regulate the growth and identity of lung adenocarcinoma in a context-specific manner.

Here, we use murine erythropoiesis as a model to study translational regulatory dynamics during mammalian cell differentiation. We uncover pervasive translational control of protein synthesis, including widespread alternative translation initiation and termination, stoichiometric synthesis, and dynamic use of upstream reading frames. We thus unravel translational regulatory programs during erythropoiesis, comprising hundreds of mRNAs with dynamic translation efficiencies and their cell type-specific regulators. A major such program involves enhanced decoding of specific mRNAs depleted in terminally differentiating/enucleating cells with decreasing transcriptional capacity. Rbm38, an erythroid-specific RNA-binding protein, promotes translation of many such genes by recruiting the translation initiation factor eIF4G. Inhibiting Rbm38 blocks red cell production, and mice lacking Rbm38 develop anemia, demonstrating an essential role for Rbm38-mediated enhanced translation of irreplaceable mRNAs.

The net transcriptome of a cancer cell is defined by relative levels of transcription factors, activators, suppressors and co-factors. These in turn are controlled by epigenetic, genetic and metabolic restraints. Here we used RNA-Seq, ChIP-qPCR, and ChIP-Seq to determine the impact of MYCN protein levels on p53 and MYCN mediated transcription in neuroblastoma, a p53 wild-type neural crest derived pediatric malignancy. Of note, about 25% of neuroblastoma is MYCN amplified and expresses 10-100 fold higher levels of MYCN protein than non-amplified tumors. We hypothesized that p53 functions would be globally altered by extreme MYCN levels and this could help to explain aggressive biology and poor long term survival which distinguishes MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. In fact, we found that in the context of high MYCN levels, activation of p53 results in marked changes in transcription of specific p53 and MYCN target loci regulating apoptosis, DNA repair and cell cycle progression. Co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous and GST-fused proteins, as well as ChIP-qPCR confirms formation of p53/MYCN complexes and enrichment of both transcription factors at active loci. This p53/MYC interaction is independent of MYC/MAX complexes. Together, these data demonstrate MYCN to be a direct co-factor modulating p53 transcriptional output in MYCN amplified cancer. To explore the interaction of the MYCN and p53 transcriptional programs, we utilized a MYCN-inducible system to evaluate p53 transcriptional responses by RNA-Seq in the presence of high and low MYCN levels. MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin3a was used to increase p53 levels in a MYCN inducible cell line.",

Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced chronic liver disease is one of the leading causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying HCC development following chronic HCV infection remain poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in cellular homeostasis within the liver and deregulation of the miRNome has been associated with liver disease including HCC. While host miRNAs are essential for HCV replication, viral infection in turn appears to induce alterations of intrahepatic miRNA networks. Although the cross-talk between HCV and liver cell miRNAs most likely contributes to liver disease pathogenesis, the functional involvement of miRNAs in HCV-driven hepatocyte injury and HCC remains elusive. Here, we combined a hepatocyte-like based model system, high-throughput small RNA-sequencing, computational analysis and functional studies to investigate HCV-miRNA interactions that may contribute to liver disease and HCC. Profiling analyses indicated that HCV infection differentially regulated the expression of 72 miRNAs by at least two-fold including miRNAs that were previously described to target genes associated with inflammation, fibrosis and cancer development. Further investigation demonstrated that miR-146a-5p was consistently increased in HCV-infected hepatocyte-like cells and primary human hepatocytes as well as in liver tissues from HCV-infected patients. Genome-wide microarray and computational analyses indicated that miR-146a-5p over-expression is related to liver disease and HCC development. Furthermore, we showed that miR-146a-5p positively impacts on late steps of the viral replication cycle thereby increasing HCV infection. Collectively, our data indicate that the HCV-induced increase in miR-146a-5p expression both promotes viral infection and is relevant for pathogenesis of liver disease. Small RNA-Seq was performed in hepatocyte-like Huh7.5.1dif cells that were subjected to 7 days infection using HCVcc Jc1E2FLAG (three samples). Uninfected cells were analyzed in parallel as a control (three samples).",

We hypothesize that a change in the patterns of gene expression is important in these age-related events. To test this, hearts were harvested from young and aged male rats (3-4 and 20-22 mo, respectively). Total mRNA was extracted and prepared for hybridization to Affymetrix U34A GeneChips. Filtering criteria, involving fold change and a statistical significance cutoff were employed, yielding 263 probe pairs exhibiting differential signals. Of the 163 annotated genes, at least 56 (34%) were classified as signaling/cell communication. Of these 56, approximately half were directly involved in G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways. We next determined which of these changes might be involved in anti-adrenergic activity and identified 19 potentially important gene products. Importantly, we observed a decrease in beta1-adrenergic receptor and adenylyl cyclase mRNAs, whereas the mRNA encoding beta-arrestin increased. Furthermore, the results demonstrate an increase in mRNAs encoding the adenosine A1 receptor and phospholipase D, which could increase anti-adrenergic effects. Moreover, the mRNAs encoding the muscarinic M3 receptor, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor beta3, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-related protein were increased as was the mRNA encoding guanylate kinase-associated protein. Interestingly, we also observed eight mRNAs whose abundance changed three- to sixfold with aging that could be considered as being compensatory. Although these results do not prove causality, they demonstrate that cardiac aging is associated with changes in the profiles of gene expression and that many of these changes may contribute to reduced adrenergic signaling.Keywords = agingKeywords = heartKeywords: other.",

Dermal fibroblasts represent a heterogeneous population of cells with diverse features that remain largely undefined due to a lack of functional subclasses. Here we reveal the presence of multiple lineages of dermal fibroblasts within the dorsal back. Genetic lineage tracing and transplantation assays demonstrate that the bulk of connective tissue deposition during embryonic development, cutaneous wound healing, radiation fibrosis, and cancer stroma formation is carried out by a single, somitic-derived fibroblast lineage. Reciprocal transplantation of distinct fibroblast lineages between the dorsal back and oral cavity induced ectopic dermal architectures that mimic their place-of-origin. These studies demonstrate that intra and inter-site diversity of dermal architectures are set embryonically and maintained postnatally by distinct lineages of fibroblasts. Lineage-specific cell ablation using transgenic-mediated expression of the simian diphtheria toxin receptor in conjunction with localized administration of diphtheria toxin led to diminished connective tissue deposition in wounds and significantly reduced melanoma growth in the dorsal skin of mice. Using flow cytometry and in silico approaches, we identify CD26/DPP4 as a surface marker that allows for the isolation of this fibrogenic, scar-forming lineage. Small molecule-based inhibition of CD26/DPP4 enzymatic activity during wound healing results in diminished cutaneous scarring. The identification and prospective isolation of these lineages holds promise for translational medicine aimed at in vivo modulation of their fibrogenic behavior. Dermal fibroblasts were harvested for FACS from the oral dermis and cranial dermis of Wnt1Cre; R26mTmG mice, and from ventral and dorsal dermis of En1Cre; R26mTmG mice as previously described. For all microarray analysis, EPFs and ENFs where harvested from backskin of mice at 30 days of age. Positivity for GFP or RFP allowed for the separation of EPFs from ENFs and WPFs from WNFs. RNA was precipitated via chloroform-phenol extraction. Samples were processed for cleanup and concentration using Rneasy MinElute cleanup kit (cat. 74204, QIAGEN).

Mammary gland (MG) de novo lipogenesis contributes significantly to milk fat in animals but little is known in humans.

Healthy lactating women were studied on two isocaloric, isonitrogenous diets. On one occasion subjects received diets containing H-FAT or H-CHO diet for 1 week. Incorporation of 13C from infused [U-13C]glucose into FAs and glycerol was measured using GC/MS methodology and gene expression using RNA isolated from breast milk fat globule (MFG). Incorporation of 13C2 into milk FAs, increased with increased chain length of the FAs from C2:0 to C12:0 but progressively declined in C14:0 and C16:0 and was not detected in FAs >C16. During feeding, regardless of diets, enrichment of 13C2 in milk FA and 13C3 in milk glycerol were ~3 and ~7 fold higher compared to plasma FA and glycerol, respectively.

The expression of genes involved in FA or glycerol synthesis pathways was unchanged regardless of diet or fast-fed conditions. Conclusions: The human MG is capable of de novo lipogenesis, of primarily MCFAs and glycerol, which is influenced by the macro-nutrient composition of the maternal diet.

In this study, we systematically identified endogenous miRNA target genes by using AGO2 immunoprecipitation (AGO2-IP) and microarray analyses in two breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, representing luminal and basal-like breast cancer, respectively. The expression levels of ~70% of the AGO2-IP mRNAs were increased by DROSHA or DICER1 knockdown. In addition, integrated analysis of miRNA expression profiles, mRNA-AGO2 interaction, and the 3'-UTR of mRNAs revealed that >60% of the AGO2-IP mRNAs were putative targets of the fifty most abundantly expressed miRNAs. To identify mRNAs responsive to miRNA synthesis inhibition, total RNA was prepared from control cells and cells that stably express small hairpin RNA against DICER1 or DROSHA.

The v-erbA oncogene belongs to a superfamily of transcription factors called nuclear receptors, which includes the thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) responsible for mediating the effects of thyroid hormone (T3). Nuclear receptors bind to specific DNA sequences in the promoter region of target genes and v-erbA is known to exert a dominant negative effect on the activity of the TRs. The repressor activity of v-erbA has been linked to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a mouse model. We have used microarray analysis to identify genes differentially expressed in hepatocytes in culture (AML12 cells) stably transfected with v-erbA and exposed to T3. We have found that v-erbA can negatively regulate expression of T3-responsive genes known to have a protective function against tumor development. We have also identified a number of v-erbA- (but not T3-) responsive genes that are known to be involved in carcinogenesis and which may play a role in the development of HCC. AML12 control cells and v-erbA-transfected AML12 cells were exposed to 10 nM T3 for 3h or 24h. Using microarray analysis, we compared gene expression in the presence and absence of v-erbA and identified T3-regulated genes differentially expressed in the presence of v-erbA.",

We demonstrate that stress differentially regulates glutamate homeostasis in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus and established a previously unknown role for the glial marker xCT in the homeostatic regulation of the ventral dentate gyrus (vDG) in stress resilience and antidepressant responses. We provide RNAseq roadmap for the stress-sensitive vDG and show that the transcription factor REST binds to xCT promoter in co-occupancy with the epigenetic marker H3K27acet, to negatively regulate xCT expression. Reduced xCT was also observed in a genetic mouse model of inherent susceptibility to depression. Pharmacologically modulating histone acetylation with next-generation therapeutics, such as acetyl-N-cysteine (NAC) or acetyl-L-carnitine (LAC), rapidly increased xCT reduction and activated a network that included mGlu2 receptors to prime an enhanced glutamate homeostasis that promoted stress resilience and antidepressant-like responses. Moreover, pharmacological xCT blockage counteracted NAC prophylactic effects. Anatomical (vDG) and cell-type specific (GFAP+) virus-overexpression mimicked the effects of pharmacological treatments in increasing stress resilience. These findings establish xCT as critical regulator of the glutamate system in a network with mGlu2 receptors. These studies also point to a role of histone acetylation as mediator of stress resilience. Ventral dentate gyrus RNA from 3 biological replicates per group (Not-stressed Controls or Ctrl and Chronic Restrained Stress or CRS, all male mice) was used for library prep (TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Human/Mouse/Rat) and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2500 at the Genomic Core facility at The Rockefeller University.

Transactivation of the dopamine receptor 3 gene by a single provirus integration results in development of B-cell lymphoma in transgenic mice generated from retrovirally transduced embryonic stem cells.Gene transfer vectors based on retroviruses are commonly used in gene therapy applications because of their unique ability to integrate efficiently into host genomes. This ability also forms the basis of a transformation event that can be induced in transduced cells by transactivation of proto-oncogenes near the vector integration sites. Here, we report on the development of lymphoma in mice generated from embryonic stem cells transduced with an enhanced green fluorescent protein. The cells expressed B220, CD5, Mac1, and IgM on their surfaces and expressed transcription factors characteristic of B cell lymphoma. Importantly, each mouse had a single copy of the provirus in its genome; the copy was integrated into the second intron of the dopamine receptor 3 (D3) gene, and high-level expression of D3 was detected only in the lymphoma cells. Ectopic expression of D3 in murine marrow cells resulted in preferential proliferation of cells at the pre-B-cell stage in response to a D3-specific agonist, but this proliferation was not observed in vivo. Cells co-transduced with D3 and Bcl-xL genes had a phenotype similar to that of lymphoma in vivo, suggesting that the leukemogenesis induced by retroviral integration required \"second hit\" mutations of additional genes.

The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to tumor heterogeneity and has been implicated in tumor initiation and metastasis. To systematically identify genes involved in EMT, we performed a genome-scale expression screen in human mammary epithelial cells and found a striking enrichment in RNA splicing factors. In particular, the RNA-binding proteins QKI and RBFOX1 were necessary and sufficient to promote EMT and stem-like states. Among the transcripts cooperatively regulated by both factors, we found that alternative splicing of the actin-binding protein FLNB plays an essential role in the regulation of EMT. The skipping of FLNB exon 30 and the elevated expression of QKI were strongly associated with EMT gene signatures in both basal B subtype breast cancer cell lines and basal-like breast cancer patient samples. These observations demonstrate that alternative splicing regulated by QKI and RBFOX1 plays an active role in promoting EMT in basal-like breast cancers.

Different mechanisms for CBF-MYH11 function in acute myeloid Leukemia (AML) with inv(16) have been proposed such as tethering of RUNX1 outside the nucleus, interference with transcription factor complex assembly and recruitment of histone deacetylases, all resulting in transcriptional repression of RUNX1 target genes. Here, through genome-wide CBF-MYH11 binding site analysis and quantitative interaction proteomics we found that CBF-MYH11 localizes to RUNX1 occupied promoters where it interacts with TAL1, FLI1 and TBP associated factors (TAFs) in the context of the hematopoietic transcription factors ERG, GATA2 and PU.1/SPI1 and the co regulators EP300 and HDAC1. Transcriptional analysis revealed that upon fusion protein knock down a subset of the CBF-MYH11 target genes show increased expression, confirming a role in transcriptional repression. However, the majority of CBF-MYH11 target genes, including genes implicated in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal such as ID1, LMO1 and JAG1, are actively transcribed and upon fusion protein knock down repressed. Together these results suggest an essential role for CBF-MYH11 in regulating expression of genes involved in maintaining a stem cell phenotype. 17 ChIP-seq samples using antibodies recognizing the indicated proteins and one RNA-seq file from ME-1 cells were analyzed. In addition 2 ChIP-seq profiles were generated using patient AML cells. A CBFb-MYH11 inducible U937 system (U937CM) was used to examine binding patterns before (1 profile) and after (2 profiles) induction of CBFb-MYH11. In addition, expression was measured through RNA-seq analysis of the two states. The U937CM cells were maintained in the presence of tetracyclin (Tet, 1 uM) and grown in the absence of tetracycline for 3 days to induce expression of CBFb-MYH11. Finally, a CBFb-MYH11 knock down system was developed in ME-1 cells.

It is characterized by the dysfunction and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Although many studies have implicated various molecules in glaucoma, no mechanism has been shown to be responsible for the earliest detectable damage to RGCs and their axons in the optic nerve. Here, we show that the leukocyte transendothelial migration pathway is activated in the optic nerve head at the earliest stages of disease in an inherited mouse model of glaucoma. This resulted in proinflammatory monocytes entering the optic nerve prior to detectable neuronal damage. A 1-time x-ray treatment prevented monocyte entry and subsequent glaucomatous damage. A single x-ray treatment of an individual eye in young mice provided that eye with long-term protection from glaucoma but had no effect on the contralateral eye. Localized radiation treatment prevented detectable neuronal damage and dysfunction in treated eyes, despite the continued presence of other glaucomatous stresses and signaling pathways. Injection of endothelin-2, a damaging mediator produced by the monocytes, into irradiated eyes, combined with the other glaucomatous stresses, restored neural damage with a topography characteristic of glaucoma. Together, these data support a model of glaucomatous damage involving monocyte entry into the optic nerve. Genome-wide assessment of gene expression changes was performed in DBA/2J-Gpnmb+, DBA/2J mice and irradiated DBA/2J mice at 8.5 and 10.5 months of age.

Kupffer cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various liver diseases. However, their involvement in metabolic disorders of the liver, including fatty liver disease, remains unclear. The present study sought to determine the impact of Kupffer cells on hepatic triglyceride storage and to explore the possible mechanisms involved. To that end, C57Bl/6 mice rendered obese and steatotic by chronic high-fat feeding were treated for 1 week with clodronate liposomes, which cause depletion of Kupffer cells. Loss of expression of marker genes Cd68, F4/80, and Clec4f, and loss of Cd68 immunostaining verified almost complete removal of Kupffer cells from the liver. Also, expression of complement components C1, the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 6 (Ccl6), and cytokines interleukin-15 (IL-15) and IL-1beta were markedly reduced. Importantly, Kupffer cell depletion significantly decreased liver triglyceride and glucosylceramide levels concurrent with increased expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (Cpt1alpha), and fatty acid transport protein 2 (Fatp2). Treatment of mice with IL-1beta decreased expression of PPARalpha and its target genes, which was confirmed in primary hepatocytes. Consistent with these data, IL-1beta suppressed human and mouse PPARalpha promoter activity. Suppression of PPARalpha promoter activity was recapitulated by overexpression of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) subunit p50 and p65, and was abolished upon deletion of putative NF-kappaB binding sites. Finally, IL-1beta and NF-kappaB interfered with the ability of PPARalpha to activate gene transcription. CONCLUSION: Our data point toward important cross-talk between Kupffer cells and hepatocytes in the regulation of hepatic triglyceride storage. The effect of Kupffer cells on liver triglycerides are at least partially mediated by IL-1beta, which suppresses PPARalpha expression and activity.

Similarly, buffy coat microarray expression profiles were generated from 20 mechanically ventilated patients every two days for up to three weeks; 11 of these patients developed pneumonia. Principal components analysis of the expression levels of the human orthologs for the mouse genes resulted in gene expression trajectories that describe the cohort of 11 patients as they develop, are treated for, and convalesce from ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). When the VAP microarray profiles were analyzed independently, 85 genes were identified with consistent changes in abundance during the seven days bracketing the diagnosis of VAP. The estimated prediction accuracy in this small patient cohort was 91%. The abundance of select transcripts was validated using real-time PCR. Principal components analysis of the average microarray-measured abundances of these genes defined a general trajectory (riboleukogram) for the onset of acute infection in this patient population. Individual riboleukograms demonstrated that the onset and course of infection are specific for each individual, but as patients recover from infection the riboleukograms converge. The gene ontologies of the co-expression networks indicate that leukocyte chemokines and granule maturation are especially informative for pneumonia diagnostics.",

This work shows that signaling-lymphocytic-activation-molecule-1 (SLAMF1), a co-stimulatory molecule and a microbial sensor, is expressed by normal CD19+/CD5+ B-lymphocytes. Its expression is lost in a subset of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) characterized by an aggressive form of the disease, with shorter time to first treatment and overall survival. Silencing of SLAMF1 in the CLL-like Mec-1 cell line (constitutively SLAMF1+) modulated pathways connected to cell migration, cytoskeletal organization and intracellular vesicle formation/recirculation. Loss of SLAMF1 was associated to increased expression of CXCR4, CD38 and CD44, positively affecting chemotactic responses to CXCL12. Ligation of SLAMF1 with an agonistic monoclonal antibody promoted the autophagic flux, by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and inducing phosphorylation of p38, JNK1/2 and bcl-2. The direct consequence was the assembly of the autophagy macro-complex that included SLAMF1, the scaffold protein Beclin1 and the enzyme Vps34. Consistently, SLAMF1-silenced cells or SLAMF1low primary CLL cells were resistant to autophagy-activating therapeutic agents, such as fludarabine or the BH3 mimetic ABT-737. These results indicate that loss of SLAMF1 expression modulates genetic pathways regulating chemotaxis and autophagy and potentially affecting drug responses, thus providing a likely explanation for the unfavorable clinical outcome experienced by this patient subset. Microarrays were performed comparing genetic signature of CLL-like Mec-1 cell line (constitutively SLAMF1+), transfected with a non-effective (scrambled) shRNA cassette (TR30013) used as control, and a Mec-1 variant generated silencing SLAMF1 gene using pGFP-V-RS construct for SLAMF1 shRNA (TG309422).

Although microglial have an essential role in host defense in the brain, the abnormal activation of microglia can lead to devastating outcomes, such as neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Emerging evidence increasingly supports that FTY720 (fingolimod), an FDA-approved drug has beneficial effects in the CNS on brain cells and more recently immunosuppressive activities in microglia via modulation of the S1P1 receptor. However, the exact molecular aspects of FTY720 contribution in microglia remain largely unaddressed. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the roles of FTY720 in microglia, we performed gene expression profiling in resting, FTY720, LPS and LPS+FTY720 challenged primary microglial cells (PM) isolated from 3-day-old ICR mice and we identified FTY720 target genes and co-regulated modules that were critical in inflammation. By examining RNA-sequencing and binding motif datasets from FTY720 suppressed LPS-induced inflammatory mediators, we also identified unexpected relationships between the inducible transcription factors (TFs), motif strength, and transcription of key inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, we show that FTY720 controls important inflammatory genes targets by modulating STAT1, and IRF8 level at their promoter site. Our unprecedented findings demonstrate that FTY720 could be a useful therapeutic application for neuroinflammatory diseases associated with microglia activation as well as provide a rich resource and framework for future analyses of FTY720 on microglia interaction.

Understanding the crosstalk between malignant B-cells and their milieu could provide clues on the molecular and clinical biology of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). Aiming to generate novel therapeutic strategies, different groups have studied different CLL proliferative fractions. We previously, identified one of these proliferative subsets in the peripheral blood from progressive unmutated CLL patients. Since the presence of this small subset appears to be a hallmark of a proliferative disease in which B lymphocytes are being constitutively activated in the proliferative centers of these patients, we performed gene expression analysis comparing the global mRNA and microRNAs expression of this leukemic subpopulation. Our results suggest that the proliferative behaviour of this fraction appears to depend on microRNA-22 over-expression, which induces PTEN downregulation and PI3K/AKT pathway activation. Transfection experiments demonstrated that miR-22 overexpression in CLL B-cells switches on PI3K/AKT leading to FOXO1 inactivation, p27-Kip1 downregulation, and overexpression of Survivin and Ki-67 proteins. We also demonstrated that this pathway could be triggered by microenvironment signals like CD40L/IL4 and more importantly, that this regulatory loop is also present in lymph nodes from progressive UM patients. Altogether, these results underline the key role of PI3K/AKT pathway in the generation of the CLL proliferative pool and provide rationale for the usage of PI3K inhibitors.

    "text": "Gene expression in LPS stimulated IkappaB-beta knockout bone marrow derived macrophage (BMDM). Inflammation is beneficial when it is part of the innate immune response, but harmful when it occurs in an unregulated, chronic manner. We now report that IkappaB-beta, a member of the classical IkappaB family, serves a dual role of both inhibiting and facilitating the inflammatory response. IkappaB-beta degradation releases NF-kappaB dimers which upregulate proinflammatory target genes such as TNF-alpha. Suprisingly absence of IkappaB-beta results in a dramatic reduction of TNF-alpha in response to LPS even though the activation of NF-kappaB is normal. The inhibition of TNF-alpha mRNA expression can be correlated to the absence of nuclear, hypophosphorylated-IkappaB-beta bound to p65:cRel heterodimers at a specific kappaB site on the TNF-alpha promoter. Therefore IkappaB-beta acts through p65:cRel dimers to maintain prolonged expression of TNF-alpha. As a result, IkappaB-beta knockout mice are resistant to LPS induced septic shock and collagen-induced arthritis, and therefore blocking IkappaB-beta might be a promising new strategy for selectively inhibiting the chronic phase of TNF-alpha producting during the inflammatory response. Wild type and IkappaB-beta knockout BMDM cells were stimulated with LPS(1ug/ml) for 0, 1, and 5 hours.

We aim to identify major oncogenic pathways in GC that robustly impact patient survival and treatment response. We used an in silico strategy based on gene expression signatures and connectivity analytics to map patterns of oncogenic pathway activation in 25 unique GC cell lines, and in 301 primary gastric cancers from three independent patient cohorts. Of 11 oncogenic pathways previously implicated in GC, we identified three predominant pathways (proliferation/stem cell, NF-kB, and Wnt/b-catenin) deregulated in the majority (>70%) of gastric tumors. Using a variety of proliferative, Wnt, and NF-kB-related assays, we experimentally validated the pathway predictions in multiple GC cell lines showing similar pathway activation patterns in vitro. Patients stratified at the level of individual pathways did not exhibit consistent differences in clinical outcome. However, patients grouped by oncogenic pathway combinations demonstrated robust and significant survival differences (e.g., high proliferation/high NF-kB vs. low proliferation/low NF-kB), suggesting that tumor behavior in GC is likely influenced by the combined effects of multiple oncogenic pathways.

Recurrent mutations in ASXL1 are found in various hematological malignancies and are associated with poor prognosis. In particular, ASXL1 mutations are frequently found in patients with hematological malignancies associated with myelodysplasia including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Although loss-of-function ASXL1 mutations promote myeloid transformation, a large subset of ASXL1 mutations is thought to result in stable truncation of ASXL1. Here we demonstrate that C-terminal truncating ASXL1 mutations (ASXL1-MT) inhibit myeloid differentiation and induce MDS-like disease in mice, displaying all the features of human MDS including multi-lineage myelodysplasia, pancytopenia and occasional progression to overt leukemia. Concerning the molecular mechanisms, ASXL1-MT derepressed expression of Hoxa9 and miR-125a through inhibiting PRC2-mediated methylation of H3K27. miR-125a targeted expression of a surface receptor Clec5a, which was found to supports for myeloid differentiation. In addition, HOXA9 expression was high in MDS patients with ASXL1 mutations while Clec5a expression was generally low in MDS patients. Thus, ASXL1-MT induced MDS-like disease in mice via derepression of Hoxa9 and miR-125a, and Clec5a downregulation. Our data provide evidence for a novel axis of MDS pathogenesis (ASXL1 mutations-upregulation of HoxA9 and miR-125a-downregulation of Clec5a) and implicate both ASXL1 mutants and miR-125a as therapeutic targets in MDS. Using 32Dcl3 cells transduced with pMYs-IG (mock) and pMYs-FLAG-ASXL1-MT-IG, we compared the expression profiles of 32Dcl3 cells with mock or ASXL1-MT under G-CSF stimulation at 4 time points, including 0hr (IL-3), 2hr, 6hr and 24hrs.

Here, we characterize the physical structure of heterochromatin domains in full and partial mouse iPS cells by correlative Electron Spectroscopic Imaging (ESI). In somatic and partial iPS cells, constitutive heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3 is highly compartmentalized into chromocenter structures of densely packed 10 nm chromatin fibers. In contrast, chromocenter boundaries are poorly defined in pluripotent ES and full iPS cells, and are characterized by unusually dispersed 10 nm heterochromatin fibers in high Nanog-expressing cells, including pluripotent cells of the mouse blastocyst prior to differentiation. This heterochromatin reorganization accompanies retroviral silencing during conversion of partial iPS cells by Mek/Gsk3 2i inhibitor treatment.

It is proposed that the impaired sympathoadrenal response to hypoglycemia induced by recurrent insulin-induced hypoglycemia (RH) is an adaptive phenomenon induced by specific changes in microRNA expression in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). To test this hypothesis, genome-wide microRNAomic profiling of the VMH by RNA-sequencing was performed in control and RH treated rats. Differential expression analysis identified microRNA-7a-5p and microRNA-665 as potential mediators of this phenomenon. To further test this hypothesis, experiments were conducted consisting of targeted lentiviral-mediated overexpression of microRNA-7a-5p and downregulation of microRNA-665 in the VMH. Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic clamp experiments demonstrated that targeted overexpression of microRNA-7a-5p (but not downregulation of microRNA-665) in the VMH of RH rats restored the epinephrine response to hypoglycemia. This restored response to hypoglycemia was associated with a restoration of GABAA receptor gene expression. Finally, a direct interaction of microRNA-7a-5p with 3'-UTR of GABAA receptor a1-subunit (Gabra1) gene was demonstrated in a luciferase assay. These findings indicate that 1) the impaired sympathoadrenal response induced by RH is associated with changes in VMH microRNA expression, and 2) microRNA-7a-5p, possibly via direct downregulation of GABA receptor gene expression, may serve as a mediator of the altered sympathoadrenal response to hypoglycemia. 12 samples were analysed (6 from each group).",

While chromosomal architecture varies among cell types, little is known about how this organization is established or its role in development. We integrated Hi-C, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq during cardiac differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells to generate a comprehensive profile of chromosomal architecture. We identified active and repressive domains that are dynamic during cardiogenesis and recapitulate in vivo cardiomyocytes. During differentiation, heterochromatic regions condense in cis. In contrast, many cardiac-specific genes, such as TTN (titin), transition to an active compartment coincident with upregulation. Moreover, we identify a network of genes, including TTN, that share the heart-specific splicing factor, RBM20, and become associated in trans during differentiation, suggesting the existence of a 3D nuclear splicing factory. Our results demonstrate both the dynamic nature in nuclear architecture and provide insights into how developmental genes are coordinately regulated.

Musashi1 (Msi1) is a highly conserved RNA binding protein that is required during the development of the nervous system. Msi1 has a role in neural stem cells, controlling the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Msi1 has also been implicated in cancer, being highly expressed in multiple tumor types. In this study, we analyzed Msi1 expression in a large cohort of medulloblastoma samples and showed that Msi1 is highly expressed in tumor tissue compared to normal cerebellum and that high Msi1 expression is associated with a poor prognosis. Using a nude mouse xenograft model, we demonstrate that Msi1 is important for tumor growth. We then used RIP-chip (ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation followed by microarray analysis) to identify mRNA targets of Msi1 in medulloblastoma. In conclusion, our results suggest that Msi1 functions as a regulator of multiple processes in medulloblastoma formation and could become an important therapeutic target. RIP-Chip analysis to identify mRNA preferentially associated with Msi1 protein.RIP-Chip experiments were performed on two biologically replicated samples. A total of 8 microarrays were carried on using technical replicates of Msi1 antibody vs. prebleed serum for each dye orientation. We prepared two biological replicates for two different arrays.

Renin expressing cells in the kidney's juxta-glomeruluar compartment likely also serve as progenitors for adult glomerular cells in disease. Although these cells of renin lineage (CoRL) decrease in number with advancing kidney age, accompanied by less responsiveness to typical stimuli such as ACE-inhibition, mechanisms and the impact of sex as a biological variable with age are not known. Accordingly, labeled CoRL were sorted from individual young (2m) and aged (27m) male and female Ren1cCre|ZsGreen reporter mice, and their transcriptomic profiles analyzed by RNA seq. When both aged female and male mice were combined, there were 48 differentially expressed genes (DEG) compared to young mice. However, when compared to their young sex-matched mice, aged female and male mice had 159 and 503 DEGs respectively. In addition to marked differences in individual genes between aged female and male mice, gene ontology analysis showed major pathway differences by sex. The majority of DEGs in one sex did not significantly change or changed in the opposite direction in the other sex. These results show that in CoRL of advanced age, individual genes and gene ontologies change, but differ between female and male mice, highlighting sex related differences the aging process.

The mechanisms underlying the neurodevelopmental deficits associated with the syndrome, which include cerebellar hypoplasia, developmental delay, coordination problems and autistic features, are not known. CHD7 is expressed in neural stem and progenitor cells, but its role in neurogenesis during brain development remains unknown. Here we show that deletion of Chd7 from cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCps) in the mouse results in reduced GCp proliferation, cerebellar hypoplasia, developmental delay and motor deficits. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed downregulated Reln gene expression in Chd7-deficient GCps. Recessive RELN mutations is associated with severe cerebellar hypoplasia in humans. We provide molecular and genetic evidence that reduced Reln expression contributes substantially to the GCp proliferative defect and cerebellar hypoplasia in GCp-specific Chd7 mouse mutants. Finally, we show that CHD7 is necessary for the maintenance of an open, accessible chromatin state at the Reln locus. Taken together, this study shows that Reln gene expression is regulated by chromatin remodeling, identifies CHD7 as a previously unrecognized upstream regulator of Reln and provides the first evidence that a mammalian CHD protein controls brain development by modulating chromatin accessibility in neuronal progenitors in vivo.

Obesity is a chronic organismal stress that disrupts multiple systemic and tissue-specific functions. Here, we describe the effects of established obesity on the activity of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment. We show that obesity promotes the selection of a quiescent HSC subset primed for activation, leading to aberrant hematopoietic stress responses. We establish that the transcription factor Gfi1 is a key regulator of the HSC fate in obesity as its increased expression in obesity induces their abnormal activity. We demonstrate that these dysregulations are initially triggered by the chronic oxidative stress associated with obesity. Once acquired, we show that the impact of obesity on HSCs is long lasting and cannot be reversed by weight loss or transplantation. These results demonstrated that obesity promotes irreversible changes on the long-term fitness of the HSC compartment, a phenomenon that is likely to contribute to the hematopoietic dysregulations observed in obese patients.

However, the functional relevance of these mutations remains unknown. Here we show that the JARID1B histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase is frequently amplified and overexpressed in luminal breast tumors and a somatic point mutation of JARID1B leads to the gain of luminal-specific gene expression programs. Downregulation of JARID1B in luminal breast cancer cells induces the expression of basal cell-specific genes and growth arrest, which is partially rescued by the inhibition of TGFBR thereby indicating a key role for TGFb signaling. Integrated genome-wide analysis of JARID1B chromatin binding, histone H3 lysine trimethyl (H3K4me3) and dimethyl (H3K4me2) patterns, and gene expression profiles in luminal and basal-like breast cancer cells suggest a key role for JARID1B in luminal cell-specific gene expression programs. A significant fraction of JARID1B binding-sites overlaps with CTCF in both luminal and basal-like breast cancer cells. CTCF also co-immunoprecipitates with JARID1B and it may influence its histone demethylase (HDM) activity as the H3K4me3/me2 ratio is lower at the CTCF-overlapping compared to JARID1B-unique sites. Additionally, a heterozygous JARID1B missense mutation (K1435R) in the HCC2157 basal-like breast cancer cell line is associated with unique JARID1B chromatin-binding and gene expression patterns implying gain of luminal features. In line with this, exogenous expression of this mutant in basal-like breast cancer cells leads to a gain of JARID1B binding at many luminal-specific genes. A PARADIGM score reflecting JARID1B activity in luminal breast cancer cells is associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with luminal breast tumors. Together, our data imply that JARID1B is a luminal lineage-driving oncogene and that its therapeutic targeting may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in treatment-resistant luminal breast tumors.

Many of these defects are suppressed by mutation of an activating E2F, E2f1 or E2f3, indicating that they are key downstream targets of the retinoblastoma protein, pRB. In this study, we assess how E2F4 contributes to the developmental consequences of pRb-loss. In stark contrast to the activating E2Fs, the homozygous mutation of E2f4 shortened the lifespan of Rb-/- embryos. This resulted from an exacerbation of the placental defect of the Rb-/- mice indicating that E2F4 and pRB cooperate in the development of this tissue. Further analyses indicated that this defect reflects an increase in trophectoderm-like cells. Under conditions where the placenta was wild-type but the embryo mutant for E2f4 and pRb embryos survived to birth and exhibited all of the defects that were observed in the E2f4 and Rb single mutant embryos. Thus, while pRB and E2F4 cooperate in placental development, they play largely non-overlapping roles the development of many embryonic tissues.Keywords: genetically modified tissue comparison. In one experiment, embryonic Day 13.5 placentas from wild-type and Rb -/- knock-out mice were compared.

    "text": "Non-canonical Notch signaling activates IL-6/JAK/STAT signaling in breast tumor cells and is controlled by p53 and IKKb. Notch signaling is frequently hyperactivated in breast cancer, but how the enhanced signaling contributes to the tumor process is less well understood. In this report, we identify the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a novel Notch target in breast tumor cells. Enhanced Notch signaling upregulated IL-6 expression at the transcriptional level, leading to activation of autocrine and paracrine JAK/STAT signaling. IL-6 upregulation was mediated by non-canonical Notch signaling, as it could be effectuated by a cytoplasmically localized Notch intracellular domain and was independent on the DNA-binding protein CSL. Instead, Notch-mediated IL-6 upregulation was controlled by two other factors: IKKb, a protein in the NF-kB signaling cascade, and p53. Activation of IL-6 by Notch required IKKb function, but interestingly, did not engage canonical NF-kB signaling, in contrast to IL-6 activation by inflammatory agents such as tumor necrosis factor, which requires canonical NF-kB signaling. With regard to p53 status, IL-6 expression was upregulated by Notch when p53 was mutated or lost, but restoring wildtype 53 into p53-mutated or -deficient cells abrogated the IL-6 upregulation. Furthermore, Notch-induced genome-wide transcriptomes from p53 wildtype and -mutated breast tumor cell lines differed extensively, and in a subset of genes upregulated by Notch in a p53-mutant cell line, upregulation was reduced by wildtype p53. In conclusion, we identify IL-6 as a novel non-canonical Notch target gene, and reveal roles for p53 and IKKb in non-canonical Notch signaling in breast cancer and in the generation of cell context-dependent diversity in the Notch signaling output. 30 microarray samples consisting of MCF7 (ER+, wild-type p53, luminal type B breast cancer) and MDA-MB-231 (ER-, mutated p53, basal breast cancer) cells cultured on immobilized 1 mg/ml JAGGED1-Fc or 1 mg/ml DLL4-Fc or 1 mg/ml Fc control with or without 5 mM DAPT for 6 hours in 3 biological replicates.",

Here, we show that TMBIM6 is closely associated with survival in patients with cervical, breast, lung, and prostate cancer. TMBIM6 deletion or knockdown suppressed primary tumor growth. Further, mTORC2 activation was up-regulated by TMBIM6 and stimulated glycolysis, protein synthesis, and the expression of lipid synthesis genes and glycosylated proteins. Moreover, ER-leaky Ca2+ from TMBIM6, a unique characteristic, was shown to affect mTORC2 assembly and its association with ribosomes. In addition, we identified that BIA compound, a suggestive TMBIM6 antagonist, prevented TMBIM6 binding to mTORC2, decreased mTORC2 activity, and also regulated TMBIM6-leaky Ca2+, further suppressing tumor formation and progression in cancer xenograft models. This previously unknown signaling cascade in which mTORC2 activity is enhanced via the interaction with TMBIM6 provides effective therapeutic targets for various malignancies.We used microarrays to detail the global of gene expression and identified that most of the differentially expressed genes related to apoptotic process, migration, proliferation, and metabolic pathways were decreased in TMBIM6 KO HT1080 cells.

    "text": "Statistical identification of gene association by CID in application of constructing ER regulatory network. A variety of high-throughput techniques are now available for constructing comprehensive gene regulatory networks in systems biology. In this study, we report a new statistical approach for facilitating in silico inference of regulatory network structure. The new measure of association, coefficient of intrinsic dependence (CID), is model-free and can be applied to both continuous and categorical distributions. When given two variables X and Y, CID answers whether Y is dependent on X by examining the conditional distribution of Y given X. In this paper, we apply CID to analyze the regulatory relationships between transcription factors (TFs) (X) and their downstream genes (Y) based on clinical data. More specifically, we use estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) as the variable X, and the analyses are based on 48 clinical breast cancer gene expression arrays (48A). RESULTS: The analytical utility of CID was evaluated in comparison with four commonly used statistical methods, Galton-Pearson's correlation coefficient (GPCC), Student's t-test (STT), coefficient of determination (CoD), and mutual information (MI). When being compared to GPCC, CoD, and MI, CID reveals its preferential ability to discover the regulatory association where distribution of the mRNA expression levels on X and Y does not fit linear models. On the other hand, when CID is used to measure the association of a continuous variable (Y) against a discrete variable (X), it shows similar performance as compared to STT, and appears to outperform CoD and MI. In addition, this study established a two-layer transcriptional regulatory network to exemplify the usage of CID, in combination with GPCC, in deciphering gene networks based on gene expression profiles from patient arrays. CONCLUSION: CID is shown to provide useful information for identifying associations between genes and transcription factors of interest in patient arrays. When coupled with the relationships detected by GPCC, the association predicted by CID are applicable to the construction of transcriptional regulatory networks. This study shows how information from different data sources and learning algorithms can be integrated to investigate whether relevant regulatory mechanisms identified in cell models can also be partially re-identified in clinical samples of breast cancers. AVAILABILITY: the implementation of CID in R codes can be freely downloaded from (http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~lyliu/BC/). Total 48 clinical arrays (48A) used in this study can be found in GSE9309. We designed the experiments using a given breast cancer population with clear status of estrogen receptor alpha (ER), which were confirmed by immunochemical staining (If 310% immunopositive stain is found at tumor section, we designate it as ER(+). Otherwise, it is ER(-). ) in this study. 48A consist of 36A with positive in ER status and of 12A with negative in ER status.",

The ER-resident protein kinase/endoribonuclease IRE1 is activated through trans-autophosphorylation in response to protein folding overload in the ER lumen and maintains ER homeostasis by triggering a key branch of the unfolded protein response. Here we show that mammalian IRE1a in liver cells is also phosphorylated by a kinase other than itself in response to metabolic stimuli. Glucagon stimulated protein kinase PKA, which in turn phosphorylated IRE1a at Ser724, a highly conserved site within the kinase activation domain. Blocking Ser724 phosphorylation impaired the ability of IRE1a to augment the upregulation by glucagon signaling of the expression of gluconeogenic genes. Moreover, hepatic IRE1a was highly phosphorylated at Ser724 by PKA in mice with obesity, and silencing hepatic IRE1a markedly reduced hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance. Hence, these results suggest that IRE1a integrates signals from both the ER lumen and the cytoplasm in the liver and is coupled to the glucagon signaling in the regulation of glucose metabolism.We used DNA microarray to analyze the transcriptomic change upon IRE1a overexpression or IRE1a depletion in primary hepatocytes, to study the changes related to IRE1a.

    "text": "Nuclear TIGAR mediates an epigenetic-metabolic loop via Nrf2 for cancer therapeutics resistance. Epigenetic and metabolic reprogrammings are implicated in cancer progression with unclear mechanisms. We report here that the histone methyltransferase NSD2 drives cancer cell and tumor resistance to therapeutics such as tamoxifen, doxorubicin, and radiation by reprogramming of glucose metabolism. NSD2 coordinately up-regulates expression of TIGAR, HK2 and G6PD and stimulates pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) production of NADPH for ROS reduction. We discover that elevated expression of TIGAR, previously characterized as a fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, is localized in the nuclei of resistant tumor cells where it stimulates NSD2 expression and global H3K36me2 mark. Mechanistically, TIGAR interacts with the antioxidant regulator Nrf2 and facilitates chromatin assembly of Nrf2-H3K4me3 methylase MLL1 and elongating Pol-II, independent of its metabolic enzymatic activity. In human tumors, high levels of NSD2 correlate strongly with early recurrence and poor survival and are associated with nuclear-localized TIGAR. This study defines a nuclear TIGAR-mediated, epigenetic autoregulatory loop functioning in redox rebalance for resistance to tumor therapeutics. A total of 4 samples were analyzed in this study.

We show that partially oxidized phospholipids of microvesicles (MVs) from plasma of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or cells exposed to oxidative stress induce activation of TLR4. MVs from healthy donors or reconstituted synthetic MVs can be converted to TLR4 agonists by limited oxidation, while prolonged oxidation abrogates the activity. Activation by MVs mimics the mechanism of TLR4 activation by LPS. However, LPS and MVs induce significantly different transcriptional response profile in mouse BMDMs with a strong inflammation-resolving component induced by the endogenous signals. MVs thus represent a ubiquitous endogenous danger signal released under the oxidative stress, which underlies the pervasive role of TLR4 signaling in inflammation. BMDMs (bone marrow derived macrophages) from C57BL/6J strain were stimulated with LPS (100ng/ml), oxidative stress-derived MVs (5000 MV/ml) or MVs-FR (5000 MV/ml).

Systemic arginine restriction improved outcome in multiple murine arthritis models and its removal induced preosteoclast metabolic quiescence, associated with impaired tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle function and metabolite induction. Effects of arginine deprivation on osteoclastogenesis were independent of mTORC1 activity or global transcriptional and translational inhibition.

The interplay between the inflammatory infiltrate and tissue resident cell populations (e.g. epithelial cells, fibroblasts and macrophages) invokes fibrogenesis. However, the temporal and mechanistic contributions of these cell populations to fibrosis remain poorly defined. To address this issue, liver inflammation, ductular reaction (DR) and fibrosis were induced in C57BL/6 mice by thioacetamide (TAA) administration for up to 12 weeks. TAA treatment induced two phases of liver fibrosis. A rapid peri-central inflammatory infiltrate enriched in F4/80+ monocytes co-localized with SMA+ myofibroblasts resulted in early collagen deposition, marking the start of an initial fibrotic phase (1-6 weeks). An expansion of bone marrow derived macrophages proceeded a second phase, characterized by accelerated progression of fibrosis (> 6 weeks) followed the migration of the DR from the portal tracts to the centrilobular site of injury, in association an increase in DR/macrophage interactions. Although CCL2 mRNA was rapidly induced in response to TAA, CCL2 deficiency only partially abrogated fibrosis. In contrast, CSF-1R blockade diminished CCR2neg (Ly6Clo) monocytes, attenuated the DR and significantly reduced fibrosis, illustrating the critical role of CSF-1 dependent monocyte/macrophage differentiation and linking the two phases of injury. We demonstrate that in response to liver injury, CSF-1 drives early monocyte mediated myofibroblast activation and collagen deposition, subsequent macrophage differentiation and their association with the advancing DR, the formation of fibrotic septa and the progression of liver fibrosis to cirrhosis.

Tumor necrosis factor-associated factors 2 and 3 (TRAF2 and TRAF3) were shown to function in a co-operative and non-redundant manner to suppress nuclear factor-kB2 (NF-kB2) activation, gene expression and survival in mature B cells. In the absence of this suppressive activity, B cells developed independently of the obligatory B cell survival factor, BAFF (B cell activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor family). This constitutive, lineage-specific suppression of B cell survival by TRAF2 and TRAF3 determines the requirement for BAFF to sustain B cell development in vivo. We wished to investigate the effect on gene expression in B cells which lacked the negative regulators TRAF2 and TRAF3, and hence had hyperactive NF-kB2 signalling. As Baff-tg mice display a similar phenotype, and have a genetic modification which acts in the same pathway, yet further up, than TRAF2 and TRAF3, we wished to compare and contrast Baff-tg B cells with TRAF2 and TRAF3 deficient B cells. This analysis should identify genes that are important in B cell survival.Keywords: Genetic modification. Lymph node B cells were purified from Traf2 B cell knockout mice, Traf3 B cell knockout mice, Baff-tg mice and respective controls. RNA was extracted and hybridised to Affymetrix 430 2.0 Mouse Genome Arrays. Samples were processed and hence analysed on three spearate days. Day 1 two control mice: Traf2lox/lox pool and CD19-cretg were compared to two knockout mice: Traf2DB 80 and Traf3DB 94. On Day 2 three control mice: Traf2lox/lox 77, Traf2lox/lox 79 and Traf3lox/lox 97 were compared to two knockout mice: Traf2DB 76 and Traf3DB 01.

    "text": "Genomic landscape of meningiomas: gene expression. Meningiomas are one of the most common adult brain tumors. For most patients, surgical excision is curative. However, up to 20% recur. Currently, the molecular determinants predicting recurrence and malignant transformation are lacking. We performed global genetic and genomic analysis of 85 meningioma samples of various grades.Copy number alterations were assessed by 100K SNP arrays and correlated with gene expression, proliferation indices, and clinical outcome. In addition to chromosome 22q loss, which was detected in the majority of clinical samples, chromosome 18q and 6q loss significantly predicted recurrence and was associated with anaplastic histology. Five classes of meningiomas were detected by gene expression analysis that correlated with copy number alterations, recurrence risk, and malignant histology. These classes more accurately predicted tumor recurrence than Ki-67 index, the gold standard for determining risk of recurrence, and highlight substantial expression heterogeneity between meningiomas. These data offer the most complete description of the genomic landscape of meningiomas and provide a set of tools that could be used to more accurately stratify meningioma patients into prognostic risk groups. Tumor biopsies from 43 female and 25 male subjects with sporadic meningioma were identified from the UCLA Neuro-oncology Program Tissue Bank through institutional review board approved protocols. 43 tumors were designated \"benign\" WHO I, 19 tumors were \"atypical\" WHO II, and 6 were \"anaplastic\" WHO III.

Selenoprotein synthesis is dependent on Sec tRNA and the expression of this class of proteins can be modulated by altering Sec tRNA expression. The gene encoding Sec tRNA (Trsp) is a single-copy gene and its targeted removal in liver demonstrated that selenoproteins are essential for proper function wherein their absence leads to necrosis and hepatocellular degeneration. In the present study, we found that the complete loss of selenoproteins in liver was compensated for by an enhanced expression of several phase II response genes and their corresponding gene products. The replacement of selenoprotein synthesis in mice carrying mutant Trsp transgenes, wherein housekeeping, but not stress-related selenoproteins are expressed, led to normal expression of phase II response genes. Thus the present study provides evidence for a functional link between housekeeping selenoproteins and phase II enzymes. Trsp vs DTrsp; Trsp vs A34; Trsp vs G37L; Trsp vs G37H.

In this study, our goal was to identify diagnostic gene sets (combinations) for the noninvasive classification of different phenotypes. For this purpose, the effects of a legume enriched, low glycemic index, high fermentable fiber diet was evaluated in subjects with four possible combinations of risk factors, including insulin resistance (IR) and a history of adenomatous polyps. In a randomized crossover design controlled feeding study each participant (a total of 23, 5-12/group) consumed the experimental diet (1.5 cups of cooked dry beans) and a control diet (isocaloric average American diet) for 4 wk with a 3 wk washout period between diets.

In particular, ASXL1 mutations are frequently found in patients with hematological malignancies associated with myelodysplasia including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Although loss-of-function ASXL1 mutations promote myeloid transformation, a large subset of ASXL1 mutations is thought to result in stable truncation of ASXL1. Here we demonstrate that C-terminal truncating ASXL1 mutations (ASXL1-MT) inhibit myeloid differentiation and induce MDS-like disease in mice, displaying all the features of human MDS including multi-lineage myelodysplasia, pancytopenia and occasional progression to overt leukemia. Concerning the molecular mechanisms, ASXL1-MT derepressed expression of Hoxa9 and miR-125a through inhibiting PRC2-mediated methylation of H3K27. miR-125a targeted expression of a surface receptor Clec5a, which was found to supports for myeloid differentiation. In addition, HOXA9 expression was high in MDS patients with ASXL1 mutations while Clec5a expression was generally low in MDS patients. Thus, ASXL1-MT induced MDS-like disease in mice via derepression of Hoxa9 and miR-125a, and Clec5a downregulation. Our data provide evidence for a novel axis of MDS pathogenesis (ASXL1 mutations-upregulation of HoxA9 and miR-125a-downregulation of Clec5a) and implicate both ASXL1 mutants and miR-125a as therapeutic targets in MDS. BM cells derived from mock-transplanted mice and ASXL1-MT transplanted mice were incubated with biotinylated antibodies for CD3e, B220, and TER-119, followed by incubation with streptavidin Micro Beads (Miltenyi Biotec). The marker-negative fraction was separated with LS Columns (Miltenyi Biotec). Using the sorted-BM cells, we compared the expression proliles between 3 sorted-BM cells with mock and 3 sorted-BM cells with ASXL1-MT. Total RNA was extracted by Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

We sorted HSCs (Lin-ckit+Flk2-CD150+CD48-) and LMPPs (Lin-ckit+Flk2+ CD150-CD48+) from pooled bone marrow transplant recipients and performed DNA microarray analysis in triplicate using the Affymetrix Mouse Transcriptome Assay 1.0 kit.",

Current smokers develop metastatic prostate cancer more frequently than nonsmokers, suggesting that a tobacco-derived factor induces metastasis. To identify smoking-induced alterations in human prostate tumors, we analyzed gene and protein expression of tumors from current, past, and never smokers and observed distinct molecular alterations in current smokers. Specifically, an immune and inflammation signature was identified in prostate tumors of current smokers that was either attenuated or absent in past and never smokers. Key characteristics of this signature included augmented immunoglobulin expression by tumor-infiltrating B cells, NF-kB activation, and increased interleukin-8 in tumor and blood. In an alternate approach to characterize smoking-induced oncogenic alterations, we explored the effects of nicotine in prostate cancer cells and prostate cancer-prone TRAMP mice. These experiments showed that nicotine increases both invasiveness of human prostate cancer cells and metastasis in tumor-bearing TRAMP mice, indicating that nicotine can induce a phenotype that resembles the epidemiology of smoking-associated prostate cancer progression. In summary, we describe distinct oncogenic alterations in prostate tumors from current smokers and show that nicotine can enhance prostate cancer metastasis. TRAMP mice in five replicates received either tap water or a solution of 250 ug/ml of nicotine [nicotine tartrate salt (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)] in tap water.",

In this study, we revealed a role for Tet2 in sustaining the immunosuppressive function of tumor-tissue myeloid cells. We found that Tet2 expression is increased in intratumoral myeloid cells both in mouse models of melanoma and in melanoma patients, and that this increased expression is dependent on an IL-1R-MyD88 pathway. Ablation of Tet2 in myeloid cells suppressed melanoma growth in vivo, and shifted the immunosuppressive gene expression program in tumor-associated macrophages to a proinflammatory one, with a concomitant reduction of the immunosuppressive function. This resulted in increased numbers of effector T cells in the tumor, and T cell depletion abolished the reduced tumor growth observed upon myeloid-specific deletion of Tet2. Our findings reveal a non-cell-intrinsic, tumor-promoting function for Tet2, and suggest that Tet2 may present a therapeutic target for the treatment of non-hematologic malignancies.

Although gain of chromosome-5p is one of the most frequent DNA copy number imbalances in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), the genes that drive its selection remain poorly understood. In a previous cross-sectional clinical study we showed that the microRNA processor Drosha (located on chromosome-5p) demonstrates frequent copy-number gain and over-expression in cervical SCC, associated with altered microRNA profiles. Here, we have conducted gene depletion/over-expression experiments to demonstrate the functional significance of up-regulated Drosha in cervical SCC cells. Drosha depletion by RNA-interference (RNAi) produced significant, specific reductions in cell motility/invasiveness in vitro, with a silent RNAi-resistant Drosha mutation providing phenotype rescue. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering following global profiling of 319 microRNAs in eighteen cervical SCC cell line specimens generated two groups according to Drosha expression levels. Altering Drosha levels in individual SCC lines changed the group into which the cells clustered, with gene depletion effects being rescued by the RNAi-resistant mutation. Forty-five microRNAs showed significant differential expression between the groups, including four of fourteen that were differentially-expressed in association with Drosha levels in clinical samples. miR-31 up-regulation in Drosha over-expressing samples/cell lines was the highest-ranked change (by adjusted p-value) in both analyses, an observation validated by Northern blotting. These functional data support the role of Drosha as an oncogene in cervical SCC, by affecting expression of cancer-associated microRNAs that have the potential to regulate numerous protein-coding genes.This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

Purpose: Mutations in several genetic loci lead to cardiac anomalies, with mutations in transcription factor NKX2-5 gene being one of the largest mutations known. Gestational hypoxia, such as seen in high-altitude pregnancy, has been known to affect cardiac development, and this paper aims to uncover information about the underlying mechanisms of this phenomena.Methods: Wild-type female mice were mated with Nkx2-5 mutant males, to produce offsprings. The pregnant females were then separated into two groups, one left in normal air and one breathing hypoxic, 14% oxygen, air from gestation day 10.5 to 12.5.

Here we analyzed cochlear gene expression of 7-week-old and 36-week-old DBA mice using microarrays. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) analysis confrimed that severe age-related hearing loss occured in 36-week-old mice, whereas moderate hearing loss occured in 7-week-old mice. Comprehensive gene expression analysis identified genes correlated with AHL and revealeed that 15 mitochondrial process categories, including \"mitochondrial electron transport chain\", \"oxidative phosphorylation\", \"respiratory chain complex I\", \"respiratory chain complex IV\", and \"respiratory chain complex V\", were statistically associated with AHL-correlated genes in the cochlea of 36-week-old DBA mice, and that 25 genes encoding components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (respiratory chain complex I, IV, and V) were significantly down-regulated in the cochlea. These observations provide evidence that AHL is associated with down-regulation of genes involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain in the cochlea of DBA mice, and suggest that mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction may be a key feature of AHL in mammalian cochlea.Keywords: Disease state analysis, Time course analysis.

To characterize this molecular machine, we used quantitative proteomics to assess the frequency of occurrence of detected peptides within each primary sequence, leading to the assessment of the relative abundances of 137 of these proteins.

Their structure includes two variable amino acids (AAs) and most of the studies focused on the most toxic variant: the microcystin LR (MC-LR). However, more than 80 MC variants have been described to date. Despite ingestion being the major pathway of human exposure, few in vivo studies have demonstrated macroscopic effects on the gastro-intestinal tract, but no data are available on the affected pathways by several variants on intestinal cells. Here, using a non-selective method, we investigated for the first time the effect of MC-RR and MC-LR on the human intestinal cell line Caco-2 and compared their response at the pangenomic scale. The cells were incubated for 4 hrs or 24 hrs with the same range of sub-lethal concentrations of MC-RR or MC-LR.Low effects were observed for both variants after a short-term exposure. On the contrary, dose-dependent modulations of the genes transcription levels were noticed with MC-RR and MC-LR after 24 hrs. Furthermore, the genomic profiles induced by both variants were similar suggesting a common toxicity mechanism but with higher modulation following MC-LR than MC-RR exposure. However, the functional annotation revealed major differences between the variants effects. Indeed, the well-known MC-LR affected mainly two pathways, the oxidative stress response and the cell cycle regulation, which did not elicit significant alteration following MC-RR exposure.This work is the first comparative description of the MC-LR and MC-RR effects on a human intestinal cell model. It allowed us to suggest differences in the mechanism of toxicity for MC-RR and MC-LR. These results illustrate that the toxicity of MC variants remains a key point for risk assessment. Differentiated Caco-2 cells were exposed to microcystins in free FCS culture medium for either 4 or 24 hours. Sub-lethal concentrations of 10, 50 and 100 uM of MC-LR or MC-RR were chosen for 4 hours, while 1, 5 and 10 uM were selected for 24 hours. For each condition (including the controls), the solvent concentration was fixed to 2% EtOH for MC-LR and 1.5% of 80% MeOH for MC-RR. Four to five culture replicates per condition were done.",

The host genotype has been proposed to contribute to individually composed bacterial communities in the gut. To provide deeper insight into interactions between gut bacteria and their host, we associated germ-free C3H and C57BL/10 mice with intestinal bacteria from a C57BL/10 donor mouse. Analysis of microbiota similarity between the experimental animals with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) 13 weeks after association revealed the development of a mouse strain specific microbiota. Gene expression in the colonic mucosa was analyzed with a microarray approach taking advantage of a modified Affymetrix mouse genome chip. We detected 202 genes whose expression differed significantly by a factor of < 2. Application of bioinformatics tools demonstrated that functional terms including signaling/secretion, lipid degradation/catabolism, guanine nucleotide/guanylate binding and immune response were significantly enriched in differentially expressed genes. We had a closer look at the 56 genes with expression differences of < 4 and observed a higher expression in C57BL/10 mice of the genes coding for toll-like receptor 1 (4-fold) and angiogenin 4 (33-fold) which are involved in the recognition and response to gut bacteria. In contrast, a 70-fold higher expression of the phospholipase A2, group IIA-encoding gene (Pla2g2a) was detected in C3H mice. In addition, a number of interferon-inducible genes were higher expressed in C3H than in C57BL/10 mice including Gbp1 (18-fold), Mal (7-fold), Oasl2 (7-fold), Ifi202b (7-fold), Rtp4 (6-fold), Ly6g6c (5-fold), Ifi27l2a (5-fold), Usp18 (5-fold), Ifit1 (5-fold), Ifi44 (4-fold), and Ly6g (4-fold) indicating that these cytokines play an essential role in microbiota regulation. However, genes coding for interferons, their receptors or factors involved in interferon signaling pathways were not differentially expressed between the two mouse strains. Taken together, our study confirms that the host genotype is involved in the establishment of host-specific bacterial communities in the gut. Based on expression differences after colonization with the same bacterial inoculum, we propose that Pla2g2a and interferon-dependent genes may contribute to this phenomenon. Total RNA was extracted from the colonic mucosa and hybridization was performed using 12.5 - 20 ug of cDNA on a customized Affymetrix nugomm 1a520177 chip.",

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent and deadly primary malignant brain tumor. Hallmarks are extensive intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity and highly invasive growth, which provide great challenges for treatment. Efficient therapy is lacking for GBM and the majority of patients survive less than one year from diagnosis. GBM progression and recurrence is caused by treatment-resistant glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). GSC cultures are considered important models to use in target identification and drug screening. The current state of the art method to isolate and maintain GSC cultures that faithfully mimic the primary tumor, is to use serum-free (SF) media conditions developed for neural stem cells (NSCs). Here we have investigated the outcome of explanting 230 consecutively collected GBM patient samples under both SF and standard, serum-containing media conditions. The establishment of maintainable SF cultures (SFCs) was most frequent, but for a subgroup of GBM specimens a viable culture could only be established in serum-containing media, called exclusive serum culture (ESC). ESCs expressed nestin and SOX2, and displayed all functional characteristics of GSCs, i.e. extended proliferation, sustained self-renewal and orthotopic tumor initiation. Once adapted to the in vitro milieu they were also sustainable in SF media. Molecular analyses showed that ESCs formed a discrete group that was most related to the mesenchymal GBM subtype. This distinct subgroup of GBM that had evaded modeling under SF conditions provide unique cell models of GBM intertumor heterogeneity.

Disrupted differentiation is a hallmark of numerous diseases, which in epidermis alone impact >25% of the population. In a search for dominant mediators of differentiation, we defined a requirement for the ZNF750 nuclear protein in terminal epidermal differentiation. ZNF750 controlled genes mutated in numerous human skin diseases, including FLG, LOR, LCE3B, ALOXE3, and SPINK5. ZNF750 potently induced progenitor differentiation via an evolutionarily conserved C2H2 zinc finger motif. The epidermal master regulator, p63, bound the ZNF750 promoter and was necessary for its induction. ZNF750 restored differentiation to p63-deficient tissue, suggesting it acts downstream of p63. A search for functionally important ZNF750 targets via analysis of ZNF750-regulated genes identified KLF4, a transcription factor that activates late epidermal differentiation genes. ZNF750 binds the Klf4 promoter and controls its expression. ZNF750 thus provides a direct link between a tissue-specifying factor, p63, and an effector of terminal differentiation, Klf4, and represents a potential future target for disorders of this process.

Multiple gene expression studies have demonstrated that breast cancer biological diversity is associated with distinct transcriptional programs. Transcription factors, because of their unique ability to coordinate the expression of multiple genes, are speculated to play a role in generating phenotypic plasticity associated with cancer progression including acquired drug resistance. Combinatorial libraries of artificial zinc-finger transcription factors (ZF-TFs) provide a robust means for inducing and understanding various functional components of the cancer phenotype. Herein, we utilized combinatorial ZF-TF library technology to better understand how breast cancer cells acquire resistance to a fulvestrant, a clinically important anti-endocrine therapeutic agent. We isolated six ZF-TF library members capable of inducing stable, long-term anti-endocrine drug-resistance in two independent estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cell lines. Comparative gene expression profile analysis of the ZF-TF-transduced breast cancer cell lines revealed a 72-gene cluster that constituted a common signature for the fulvestrant-resistance phenotype. Pathway enrichment-analysis of gene expression data revealed that the ZF-TF-induced fulvestrant resistance is associated with an estrogen receptor negative-like gene set and four unique myb-regulated gene sets. Furthermore, we identified a set of genes strongly expressed in the ZF-TF-induced fulvestrant-resistant cells that was correlated with a lower probability of distant metastasis-free or death-from-relapse-free survival of breast cancer patients. MCF7-R73 cells, a monoclonal MCF7 subline that is highly sensitive to fulvestrant-induced cytocidal activity, underwent retroviral transduction with the zinc finger transcription factor (ZF-TF) activator library or with a control plasmid encoding only the NF-kB p65 activation domain. Both populations of cells were enriched for transduced cells by selecting for growth in puromycin and for fulvestrant-resistant cells by selecting with 100 nM fulvestrant. After 6 weeks of continuous treatment with fulvestrant, hundreds of drug-resistant colonies emerged from the population of cells infected with the ZF-TF activator library. By contrast, as expected, the control MCF7cell line transduced by NF-kB p65-only underwent massive cell death resulting in the complete absence of resistant colonies. DNA encoding the zinc-finger arrays was rescued by PCR from genomic DNA of pooled fulvestrant-resistant cells. The sequences of the ZF-TFs were determined and 46 unique ZF-TF clones identified. These 46 unique ZF-TFs were re-cloned into the retroviral vector and converted into clonal virus stocks that were used to transduce MCF7-R73 cells. These 46 retrovirally transduced cell populations were then challenged with fulvestrant. As compared with the control MCF-238 cells, MCF7-R73 cells transduced with six unique ZF-TFs demonstrated survival and growth in the presence of 100nM fulvestrant.",

The global prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing, and it is contributing to the susceptibility to diabetes and its related epidemic in offspring. Although the impacts of paternal T2D on metabolism of offspring have been well established, the exact molecular and mechanistic basis that mediates these impacts remains largely unclear. Here we show that paternal T2D increases the susceptibility to diabetes in offspring through the gametic epigenetic alterations. Paternal T2D led to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in offspring. Relative to controls, offspring of T2D fathers exhibited altered gene expression patterns in the pancreatic islets, with downregulation of several genes involved in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling pathway. Epigenomic profiling of offspring pancreatic islets revealed numerous changes in cytosine methylation depending on paternal T2D, including reproducible changes in methylation over several insulin signaling genes. Paternal T2D altered overall methylome patterns in sperm, with a large portion of differentially methylated genes overlapped with that of pancreatic islets in offspring. Our study revealed, for the first time, that T2D can be inherited transgenerationally through the mammalian germline by an epigenetic manner. For all comparisons shown, male F0 founders were weaned from mothers at 3 weeks of age, and sibling males were put into cages with high-fat diet (33% energy as fat) or control diet until 12 weeks of age, at which point mice fed with HFD were injected intraperitoneally with a low dose of STZ and kept on the same diet for 4 weeks. Fasting blood glucose was examined each week post-STZ for 4 weeks, and only glucose level at 7~11 mM was considered as type 2 diabetes. Females were always raised on standard diet. At 16 weeks, male F0 founders were mated with females. After 1 or 2 days, males were removed, and pregnant females were left alone until their litters were 3 weeks of age. Note that we always used virgin females to avoid confounding effects brought about by the females. At 3 weeks of age a portion of the offspring were sacrificed and islets were generated, each from an independent father.Samples from six control and six paternal type 2 diabetes offspring were chosen for microarray analysis.",

    "text": "Transcriptome-wide identification and validation of interactions between the miRNA machinery and HuR on mRNA targets [HuR]. The 3' UTR of messenger RNAs serves as the regulatory region that mediates post-transcriptional control by microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Aside from individual sequence-specific binding and regulation, examples of interaction between these factors at particular 3' UTR sites have emerged in recent studies. However, the whole picture of such higher-order regulatory modules across the transcriptome is lacking. Here, we investigate the interactions between HuR, a ubiquitous RBP, and Ago2, a core effector of the miRNA pathway, at the transcriptome-wide level. Using HITS-CLIP, we map HuR and miRNA binding sites on human 3'UTRs and assess their co-occurrence. Additionally, we demonstrate global effects of HuR knockdown on Ago2 occupancy, suggesting a co-regulatory relationship. Focusing on sites of Ago2-HuR overlap, 13 candidates were screened in luciferase reporter assays, compared to miRNA site mutant controls. Eleven of the sites showed a repressive activity, which displayed significant de-repression upon subsequent testing of the reporters in Dicer-null cells, substantiating miRNA dependence. To experimentally test for HuR's role in co-regulation, we tested the reporters in CRISPR-generated HuR KO cells.

HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder is prevalent despite wide-spread use of effective anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) exacerbate neurocognitive dysfunction in HIV+ patients. Previously we have shown that chronic binge alcohol administration (CBA, 13 - 14 g EtOH/kg/wk) starting 3 months prior to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in rhesus macaques unmasks behavioral deficits. The underlying mechanisms of neurocognitive alterations due to alcohol and SIV are not known. The aim of this study was to explore the alterations in hippocampal gene expression of CBA administered, SIV-infected (CBA/SIV+; N=2) macaques and isocaloric sucrose administered, SIV-infected (SUC/SIV+; N=2) macaques in contrast to uninfected (SIV-; N=2) macaques. Transcriptomes of hippocampal samples dissected from brains obtained at necropsy (16 months post-SIV inoculation) were analyzed using Illumina Custom algorithm to determine differentially expressed genes (p-value filter of <= 0.05; either >= 1.3 fold change or <= 0.76 fold change) between SUC/SIV+ and SIV-, CBA/SIV+ and SIV-, and CBA/SIV+ and SUC/SIV+. We used Gene Codis to determine enrichment of specific Gene Ontology Biological Processes from both the SUC/SIV+ and CBA/SIV+ gene lists. Gene Codis analysis revealed over-representation of genes involved in neurodevelopment, neurotransmission, interferon-signaling, and antigen presentation in the CBA/SIV+ group. Further analysis of differentially expressed genes between SIV- and CBA/SIV+ showed predominantly up-regulation of immune function genes and down-regulation of nervous system development and synaptic transmission genes in CBA/SIV+ animals. These findings provide insight into the potential mechanisms by which CBA may enhance neurobehavioral deficits. Rhesus macaques from three experimental groups; SIV- (N=2), sucrose SIV infected (SUC/SIV+; N=2), and CBA SIV infected (CBA/SIV+; N=2) were used in the study. Animals were 4-6 years of age at the beginning of the study. Following three months of CBA administration, animals were inoculated intravenously with 10,000 times the ID50 of SIVmac251, which was provided by Preston Marx (TNPRC). Alcohol or sucrose administration continued throughout the study. Sixteen months post-SIV inoculation animals were euthanized. Hippocampal RNA from necropsy time point was used in the study.",

Nutrigenomics analysis was used to investigate the molecular responses to dietary Cu deficiency independently and in combination with 30% (w/w) sucrose in a mature rat model of NAFLD. Low Cu significantly decreased hepatic and serum Cu, and induced NAFLD-like histopathology, mild steatosis, up-regulated transcripts in inflammation and hepatic stellate cell activation, and significantly increased oxidative stress. Rats fed low Cu together with 30% sucrose also developed insulin resistance, increased ATP citrate lyase and FASN expression, and greater oxidative stress. High sucrose with adequate Cu also promoted inflammation and fibrosis, but not steatosis. This study indicates that low dietary Cu and sucrose consumption are singular and synergistic dietary factors in promotion of NAFLD and NASH that act independently of obesity or severe steatosis, likely by promoting oxidative stress and activation of inflammation and fibrosis. Mature (6 months old) male Wistar Rats that had been allowed ad libitum access to Mazuri rodent pellets were used in the study. Twenty-four rats were divided into four groups and fed for 12 weeks with diets based on the Purified AIN76A formulation, modified for target sucrose and Cu content (Custom Animal Diets, Bangor, NJ).

High activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is characteristic for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here we investigated how 4EGI-1, a small inhibitor of cap-dependent translation, induces apoptosis in T-ALL clones displaying hyperactive PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling. 4EGI-1 treatment reduced the ribosomal occupancy of transcripts that define the molecular difference between T-ALL blasts and normal thymocytes. These transcripts encoded proteins for the translational machinery, for mitochondrial metabolism as well as oncoproteins such as Cyclin D1, Bcl-2 and c-myc. Therefore, targeting translation initiation proves valuable in situations where mTOR is activated by multiple events. For each biological replicate 5 x 107 #483 T-ALL cells were treated with 100 mM 4EGI-1 or DMSO. After 2 h incubation at 37degC cells were washed in ice-cold PBS containing cycloheximide (0.1 mg/ml), pelleted and resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 % nonidet-P40, 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, 10000 IU/ml dalteparin sodium) and incubated for 5 min on ice.

A fifth zone, the perichondrium is located in apposition to the growth plate at its circumferential surface. The progression of chondrocytes through these zones, and hence growth, is regulated by a complex interplay of signaling pathways, defects in which lead to osteochondrodysplasias.

    "text": "Molecular analysis of precursor lesions in familial pancreatic cancer. Background: With less than a 5% survival rate pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is almost uniformly lethal. In order to make a significant impact on survival of patients with this malignancy, it is necessary to diagnose the disease early, when curative surgery is still possible. Detailed knowledge of the natural history of the disease and molecular events leading to its progression is therefore critical.Methods and Findings: We have analysed the precursor lesions, PanINs, from prophylactic pancreatectomy specimens of patients from four different kindreds with high risk of familial pancreatic cancer who were treated for histologically proven PanIN-2/3. Thus, the material was procured before pancreatic cancer has developed, rather than from PanINs in a tissue field that already contains cancer. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling using such unique specimens was performed. Bulk frozen sections displaying the most extensive but not microdissected PanIN-2/3 lesions were used in order to obtain the holistic view of both the precursor lesions and their microenvironment. A panel of 76 commonly dysregulated genes that underlie neoplastic progression from normal pancreas to PanINs and PDAC were identified. In addition to shared genes some differences between the PanINs of individual families as well as between the PanINs and PDACs were also seen. This was particularly pronounced in the stromal and immune responses.Conclusions: Our comprehensive analysis of precursor lesions without the invasive component provides the definitive molecular proof that PanIN lesions beget cancer from a molecular standpoint. We demonstrate the need for accumulation of transcriptomic changes during the progression of PanIN to PDAC, both in the epithelium and in the surrounding stroma. An identified 76-gene signature of PDAC progression presents a rich candidate pool for the development of early diagnostic and/or surveillance markers as well as potential novel preventive/therapeutic targets for both familial and sporadic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Gene expression of 13 PanIN samples was compared to profiling data of whole biopsies from normal donor pancreas (N1 to 4, two replicated samples) and sporadic PDAC (PDAC1 to 6).Ttwo PDAC samples (PDAC 3 and 4) and a replicate of one normal specimen (N4) were removed during the hybridisation quality assessment.",

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) and cancer pathophysiology share common signal transduction pathways leading to abnormal endothelial and smooth muscle cell interactions and angioproliferative vasculopathy. Sorafenib (Sor) a drug in clinical trials for cancer treatment, is an inhibitor of multiple kinases important in angiogenesis (Raf-1 kinase, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, PDGFR-beta). In this study, we assessed the efficacy of Sor as a potential therapy for PH, and hypothesized that Sor prevents the development of both a conventional and an augmented rodent model of PH. We performed studies in Dahl Salt-Sensitive rats (SS) exposed to hypoxia alone and in combination with the VEGFR-2 inhibitor, SU5416, known to induce a well-characterized augmented PH phenotype. Rats were, thus, divided into 5 groups: normoxia/vehicle (Norm), hypoxia/vehicle (H), hypoxia/ SU5416 (H-SU), hypoxia/Sorafenib (H-Sor) and hypoxia/ SU5416/ Sorafenib (H-SU-Sor). Except for the Norm group, all rats were maintained in a hypoxia chamber with a FiO2 of 10%. Rats received a single injection of SU5416 on Day 1 (20 mg/kg) and Sor solution was administered daily by gavage (2.5mg/kg). After 3.5 weeks, all rats were assessed by open chest catheterizations for pulmonary vascular and right ventricular pressures. Lung and heart tissue were harvested for histological and microarray analyses. Our results showed H-SU rats developed severe PH with changes in hemodynamic and histologic parameters when compared to Norm controls while rats exposed to H alone only displayed mildly elevated pressures compared with Norm. There was no significant change in pressures in the H-Sor or H-SU-Sor compared to Norm. Histopathology demonstrated a dramatic prevention of the PH phenotype in the H-SU-Sor rats with no significant remodeling compared with H-SU rats. Expression profiling data from H (n=4) and H-SU (n=3) rat lungs were compared to Norm (n=4) using normalization in R and SAM (d>.639,) (minimum fold change >1.4). With false discovery rates (FDR) of 6.5% in hypoxia and 1.6% in H-SU, 1019 and 465 genes, respectively, were differentially-regulated compared to Norm. In addition, 38 genes were differentially expressed between H-SU and H-SU-Sor (n=4, FDR 6.7%) revealing a molecular signature with potentially novel target genes of Sor. Five differentially expressed genes (Tgfbeta3, C1qg, Nexn, Frzb, and Plaur) were examined by real-time RT-PCR and three were further validated by immunohistochemistry confirming the regulation on protein level. Based on the known pathways of hypoxic-induced PH and Sor, we further utilized immunohistochemistry to show the up-regulation of mediators of the MAPK cascade in the H and H-SU models of PH with subsequent, down-regulation by Sor. We therefore present Sor as a novel treatment for the development of severe PH and theorize that the MAPK cascade is a canonical pathway involved both in the development of PH and in the attenuation by Sor.Keywords: Drug Effect. Rats were divided into 5 groups of which 4 groups were analyzed by microarrays: normoxia/vehicle (n=4), hypoxia/vehicle (n=4), hypoxia/ SU5416 (n=3), and hypoxia/ SU5416/ Sorafenib (n=4).

    "text": "Gene expression during neuronal differentiation in two subtypes of SH-SY5Y. Background: SH-SY5Y cells exhibit a neuronal phenotype when treated with all-trans retinoic acid (RA), but the molecular mechanism of activation in the signaling pathway mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is not sufficiently understood. To shed new light on the mechanism, we comprehensively compared the gene expression profiles between SK-N-SH cells and two subtypes of SH-SY5Y cells (SH-SY5Y-A and SH-SY5Y-E), each of which showed a different phenotype during RA-mediated differentiation. Results: SH-SY5Y-A cells differentiated in the presence of RA, whereas RA-treated SH-SY5Y-E cells required additional treatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) for full differentiation. In combination with perturbation using a PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, we identified 386 genes and categorized them into two clusters dependent on the PI3K signaling pathway during RA-mediated differentiation in SH-SY5Y-A cells. Transcriptional regulation of the gene cluster was greatly reduced in SK-N-SH cells or partially impaired in SH-SY5Y-E cells in coincidence with a defect in the neuronal phenotype of these cell lines. Additional stimulation with BDNF induced a set of neural genes which were down-regulated in RA-treated SH-SY5Y-E cells but were abundant in the differentiated SH-SY5Y-A cells. Conclusions: We identified the gene clusters controlled by PI3K- and TRKB-mediated signaling pathways during differentiation in two subtypes of SH-SY5Y cells. TRKB-mediated bypass pathway compensates for the impaired neural functions generated by defects in several signaling pathways including PI3K in SH-SY5Y-E cells. The expression profiling data are useful for further studies to elucidate the signal transduction-transcriptional network including PI3K and/or TRKB.Keywords: Cell type comparison, time course. Human neuroblastomas, SK-N-SH (HTB-11) and SH-SY5Y-A cells (CRL-2266) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). We also obtained SH-SY5Y-E cells (EC94030304) from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC). Tissue culture cells were maintained in D-MEM/F12 1:1 mixture supplemented with 15% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum) and 1% NEAA (Non-essential amino acid) in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37oC. The culture medium was changed twice a week. For the RA-inducible experiment, random culture cells from two clone subtypes of SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH were seeded in laminin coated culture dishes (BioCoat Laminin Cellware; BD Biosciences, Billerica, MA, USA) for 1 day and then transferred to a medium containing 10 mM of RA in the presence or the absence of LY294002 (10mM) for five days. For BDNF-induced sequential differentiation of the SH-SY5Y-E strain, cells were washed with D-MEM/F12 twice after five days in the presence of RA and then incubated with 50 ng/ml of BDNF in D-MEM/F12 without serum for three days.",

Clear cell sarcoma (CCS) is an aggressive soft tissue malignant tumor characterized by a unique t(12; 22) translocation, leading to the expression of a chimeric EWS/ATF1 fusion gene. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying how EWS/ATF1 is involved in the development of CCSs. In addition, the cells of origin for CCSs remain to be determined. We generated EWS/ATF1-inducible mice, and examined the effects of EWS/ATF1 expression in adult cells. We show that the forced expression of EWS/ATF1 results in the development of EWS/ATF1-dependent sarcomas in mice. The histology of EWS/ATF1-induced sarcomas resembles that of CCSs and EWS/ATF1-induced tumor cells express CCS-markers, such as S100, Sox10, and Mitf. A lineage tracing experiment revealed that such sarcomas are derived from neural crest-lineage cells. Finally, we found that EWS/ATF1 directly induces Fos in an ERK-independent manner, and demonstrated that the increased Fos expression is important for the active cell proliferation in not only EWS/ATF1-induced sarcomas, but also in human CCSs. Our results indicate that FOS, as well as EWS/ATF1 itself, could be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of EWS/ATF1-related sarcomas. Tumor cell lines were exposed to different concentrations of doxycycline, and total RNAs were isolated at 24 hours after the doxycycline exposure. Total RNAs were also isolated directly from a tumor developed in a EWS/ATF1-inducible mouse given doxycycline for 3 months.

It is widely believed that oral zinc supplementation can reduce the effects of the common cold; however, there is strong clinical evidence that intranasal (IN) zinc gluconate (ZG) gel treatment for this purpose causes anosmia, or the loss of the sense of smell, in humans. Using the rat olfactory neuron cell line, Odora, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which zinc exposure exerts its toxic effects on olfactory neurons. Following treatment of Odora cells with 100 and 200 mM ZG for 0-24 h, RNA-seq and in silico analyses revealed up-regulation of pathways associated with zinc metal response, oxidative stress, and ATP production. We observed that Odora cells recovered from zinc-induced oxidative stress, but ATP depletion persisted with longer exposure to ZG.

Transcriptional mechanisms that drive angiogenesis and organotypic endothelial specialization are poorly understood. Here, we show that retinal endothelial sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors (S1PRs), which restrain vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis, spatially restrict expression of JunB, a member of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) family of transcription factors. Mechanistically, VEGF induces JunB expression at the sprouting vascular front while S1PR-dependent VE-cadherin assembly suppresses JunB expression in the nascent vascular network, thus creating a gradient of this transcription factor. Endothelial-specific JunB knockout mice showed diminished expression of neurovascular guidance genes and attenuated retinal vascular network progression. In addition, endothelial S1PR signaling is required for normal expression of ss-catenin-dependent genes such as TCF/LEF1 and ZIC3 transcription factors, transporters and junctional proteins. These results show that S1PR signaling restricts JunB function to the expanding vascular front, thus creating an AP-1 transcriptional factor gradient and enables organotypic endothelial specialization of the vascular network.

Inactivating mutations in the MEN1 gene predisposing to the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome can also cause sporadic pancreatic endocrine tumors. MEN1 encodes menin, a subunit of MLL1/MLL2-containing histone methyltransferase complexes that trimethylate histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3). The importance of menin-dependent H3K4me3 in normal and transformed pancreatic endocrine cells is unclear. To study the role of menin-dependent H3K4me3, we performed in vitro differentiation of wild-type as well as menin-null mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) into pancreatic islet-like endocrine cells (PILECs). Gene expression analysis and genome-wide H3K4me3 ChIP-Seq profiling in wild-type and menin-null mESCs and PILECs revealed menin-dependent H3K4me3 at the imprinted Dlk1-Meg3 locus in mESCs, and all four Hox loci in differentiated PILECs. Specific and significant loss of H3K4me3 and gene expression was observed for genes within the imprinted Dlk1-Meg3 locus in menin-null mESCs and the Hox loci in menin-null PILECs. Given that the reduced expression of genes within the DLK1-MEG3 locus and the HOX loci is associated with MEN1-like sporadic tumors, our data suggests a possible role for menin-dependent H3K4me3 at these genes in the initiation and progression of sporadic pancreatic endocrine tumors. Furthermore, our investigation also demonstrates that menin-null mESCs can be differentiated in vitro into islet-like endocrine cells, underscoring the utility of menin-null mESC-derived specialized cell types for genome-wide high-throughput studies.

    "text": "Identification of genes upregulated by MeTA-array in human pancreatic cancers. Identification and characterization of epigenetically silenced genes is very important for cancer research. Particularly, information of hypermethylated genes provides clues to understand roles of epigenetics in tumorigeneses, and genes frequently methylated in a tumor-specific manner can be used as tumor markers. DNA methylation inhibitors such as 5-aza-cytidine or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine were widely used to search epigenetically silenced genes. However, these inhibitors frequently upregulate genes whose promoters remain unmethylated. We tried to improve the specificity and sensitivity in detecting such methylation-mediated silenced genes in cancer and successfully developed a new method termed \"methyl-CpG targeted transcriptional activation (MeTA)\" by using a transcriptional activating fragment with a methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) that specifically recognizes and binds to methylated DNAs. Because MBD proteins in fact mediate transcriptional repression of tumor suppressor genes associated with promoter hypermethylation in cancer, MeTA is thought to be one of the ideal methods to search such genes. In the present study, we applied this method to three representative pancreatic cancer cell lines, AsPC-1, MIA PaCa-2, and PANC-1, with a normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line HPDE (as the control). All of these cell lines have already been analyzed their expression profiles by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. We first analyzed the expression of five genes by RT-PCR with Southern hybridization, NEFH, NPTX2, SFRP1, TIMP3, and UCHL1; these genes are known to be methylated in at least any one of these cancer cell lines. Upregulation by \"MeTA\" was confirmed in all of these genes. Then we searched for upregulated-genes, by two-folds or more, in all the three cancer cell lines after MeTA; nineteen such upregulated genes were identified. Among these, sixteen genes except NEFH, HOXA9, and CLDN5 have not been reported previously using the conventional DNA methylation inhibitors. Methylation status of two genes, SLC32A1 and CSMD2, were further analyzed by methylation-specific PCR and found that SLC32A1 and CSMD2 were methylated in 100% (21/21) and 83% (15/18) pancreatic cancer cell lines analyzed, respectively. Our results suggest that \"MeTA\" is a highly efficient method to isolate methylation-mediated transcriptionally silenced genes in human pancreatic cancer and that this method can be applied to other types of human cancer. Three representative pancreatic cancer cell lines, AsPC-1, MIA PaCa-2, and PANC-1, with a normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line HPDE (as the control) were transfected with pcDNA6/myc-His vector or pcDNA6-3xFLAG-NFkB (AD)-MBD and were harvested 48 h after transfection.",

A new DMM, Fe-35Mn alloy, was fabricated through powder metallurgy in order to satisfy the ideal criteria of cardiovascular stent made of DMM. Since in-stent restenosis is mediated by the extracellular matrix production, which is mostly regulated by fibroblasts, the gene expression profile of 3T3 fibroblasts in the presence of Fe-35Mn alloy was then investigated. The mechanism of cellular responses in the presence of DMM is then expected to be clearly described through the gene profiling experiment. 3T3 fibroblast cells derived from mouse (Mus musculus) embryo (BALB/3T3 clone A31, ATTC) were put in the culture and treated with iron, manganese, and Fe-35Mn alloy for 24 hour in parallel and followed by the RNA extraction.

Glucocorticoids are widely used therapeutically to suppress inflammatory/immune responses and most of their effects are produced either by altering transcription of specific genes directly, or by altering the expression of transcription factors that subsequently alter the expression of downstream genes. Relevant data from previous studies indicate that the number of genes regulated by glucocorticoid receptor exceeds 4000 in cells and that 358 different genes are regulated in the liver of adrenalectomized males rats treated with a chronic infusion of methylprednisolone for up to 1 week . However, differences in gene expression between males and females in response to glucocorticoid treatment in isolated hepatocytes are not known. Livers were isolated from adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats and digested with the collagenase perfusion method developed by Berry and Friend (J Cell Biol 43, 506-520;1969). After collagenase treatment, the liver was excised, minced in balanced salt solution, and centrifuged at 50 g for 3 min. Immediately after isolation, hepatocytes were resuspended in Williams E Medium containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), 2 mM glutamine pH 7.4, and 10% fetal bovine serum and plated on collagen-coated 94 x 16 mm cell culture dishes and maintained for 24 hours in a 95% air-5% CO2, 37degC incubator. The medium was then changed to free serum Williams E Medium and maintained in culture for an additional 24 hours. Hepatocytes isolated from male and rats were treated with vehicle (0.01% ethanol) or dexamethasone (100 nm) for 6 hours. Total RNA from cells were extracted by using the RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

There are several variants of the ribosome profiling technique that use different translation inhibitors. The regular ribo-seq utilizes Cycloheximide (CHX), a translation elongation inhibitor to freeze all translating ribosomes. In contrast to CHX, the translation inhibitor lactimidomycin (LTM) and harringtonine (Harr) have a much stronger effect on initiating ribosomes. The use of these inhibitors allows for the global mapping of translating initiating sites (TISs) when they are coupled with ribosome profiling (TI-seq). We have developed a computational tool to detect and/or quantitatively compare translation initiation from TI-seq data, and predict novel ORFs from regular CHX-based ribo-seq data. Two replicates of CHX-based ribo-seq experiments and one Harr based ribo-seq were performed in HEK293 cells for confirming the ORFs predicted using public available data. Ribosome protected fragments were extracted from HEK293 cells treated with cycloheximide or harringtonine plus cycloheximide.",

The phosphorylation of eIF4E1 at serine 209 by MNK1 or MNK2 has been shown to initiate oncogenic mRNA translation, a process that favours cancer development and maintenance. Here, we interrogate the MNK-eIF4E axis in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and show a distinct distribution of MNK1 and MNK2 in germinal centre B-cell (GCB) and activated B-cell (ABC) DLBCL. Despite displaying a differential distribution in GCB and ABC, both MNKs functionally complement each other to sustain cell survival. MNK inhibition ablates eIF4E1 phosphorylation and concurrently enhances eIF4E3 expression. Loss of MNK protein itself down-regulates total eIF4E1 protein level by reducing eIF4E1 mRNA polysomal loading without affecting total mRNA level or stability. Enhanced eIF4E3 expression marginally suppresses eIF4E1-driven translation but exhibits a unique translatome that unveils a novel role for eIF4E3 in translation initiation. Together, we propose that MNKs can modulate oncogenic translation by regulating eIF4E1-eIF4E3 levels and activity in DLBCL. As the knockdown of eIF4E1 or eIF4E3 caused significant cell death, we overexpressed either protein in HLY-1 cells and performed sucrose density gradient fractionation. RNA was extracted from polysome fractions #9-10, containing highly translated polysome-bound mRNAs, from total RNA and from an empty vector control.

The response of tumor cells to the unusual form of DNA damage caused by topoisomerase poisons such as camptothecin (CPT) is poorly understood, and knowledge regarding which drugs can be effectively combined with CPT is lacking. To better understand the response of tumor cells to CPT and to identify potential targets for adjuvant therapy, we examined global changes in mRNA abundance in HeLa cells after CPT treatment using Affymetrix U133A GeneChips, which include all annotated human genes (22,283 probe sets). Statistical analysis of the data using a Bayesian/Cyber t test and a modified Benjamini and Hochberg correction for multiple hypotheses testing identified 188 probe sets that are induced and 495 that are repressed 8 h after CPT treatment at a False Discovery Rate of <0.05 and a minimum 3-fold change. This pharmacogenomic approach led us to identify two pathways that are CPT induced: (a) the epidermal growth factor receptor; and (b) nuclear factor-kappaB-regulated antiapoptotic factors. Experiments using HeLa cells in our lab and prior animal model studies performed elsewhere confirm that inhibitors of these respective pathways super-additively enhance CPT's cytotoxicity, suggesting their potential as targets for adjuvant therapy with CPT.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents a highly aggressive form of breast cancer with limited treatment options. Proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFalpha can facilitate tumor progression and metastasis. However, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying TNBC progression mediated by inflammation is still limited. Here, we define the AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun cistrome, which is comprised of 13800 binding sites responsive to TNFalpha-induced signaling in TNBC cells. In addition, we show that c-Jun regulates nearly a third of the TNFalpha-elicited transcriptome. Expression of the c-Jun-regulated pro-invasion gene program is strongly associated with clinical outcomes in TNBCs. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that c-Jun drives TNFalpha-mediated TNBC tumorigenicity by transcriptional regulation of Ninj1. As exemplified by the c-Jun bound CXC chemokine genes clustered on chromosome 4, we demonstrate that NF-kB might be a pioneer factor and is required for the regulation of TNFalpha-inducible inflammatory genes, whereas c-Jun has little effect. Together, our results uncover AP-1 as an important determinant for inflammation-induced cancer progression, rather than inflammatory response.

This in vitro study aims to determine the role of chondrocytes in RA-related cartilage destruction and antirheumatic drug-related regenerative processes. Human chondrocytes were three-dimensionally cultured in alginate beads. To determine the RA-induced gene expression pattern, human chondrocytes were stimulated with supernatant of RA synovial fibroblasts (RASF) and normal donor synovial fibroblasts (NDSF), respectively. To examine antirheumatic drug response signatures, human chondrocytes were stimulated with supernatant of RASF that have been treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD; azathioprine, sodium aurothiomalate, chloroquine phosphate, methotrexate), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID; piroxicam, diclofenac) or steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (SAID; methylprednisolone, prednisolone). Genome-wide expression profiling with oligonucleotide microarrays was used to determine differentially expressed genes. Real-time RT-PCR and ELISA were performed for validation of microarray data. Following antirheumatic treatment, microarray analysis disclosed a reverted expression of 94 RA-induced chondrocyte genes involved in inflammation/NF-kB signalling, cytokine/chemokine activity, immune response, proliferation/differentiation and matrix remodelling. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that treatment of RASF with the DMARD azathioprine, gold sodium thiomalate and methotrexate resulted in chondrocyte gene expression signatures that were closely related to the \"healthy\" pattern. Treatment with the SAID methylprednisolone and prednisolone strongly reverted the RA-related chondrocyte gene expression, in particular the expression of genes involved in inflammation/NF-kB and cytokine/chemokine activity. The NSAID piroxicam and diclofenac and the DMARD chloroquine phosphate had only moderate to marginal effects. Pathway analysis determined major mechanisms of drug action, for example pathways of cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, TGF-b/TLR/Jak-STAT signalling and ECM-receptor interaction were targeted.

Moreover the validity of externally defined gene-modules in FFPE microarray expression profiles is unknown. Using eight breast cancer tumors with available frozen and FFPE samples, five sample-matched data sets were generated from different combination of Affymetrix arrays, amplification-and-labeling kit and sample preservation method. The reliability of differential expression analysis was investigated by developing de novo ER/HER2 pathway gene-modules from matched data sets and validating it on external data set using ROC analysis. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of module scores between matched FFPE-frozen expression profiles was used to measure reliability of externally defined gene-modules in FFPE expression profiles. Independent of array/amplification-kit/sample preservation method used, de novo ER/HER2 gene-modules derived from all matching data sets showed similar prediction performance during independent validation (AUC range; ER: 0.92-0.95, HER2: 0.88-0.91), except for de novo HER2 gene-module derived from FFPE data set with 3'IVT kit (AUC: 0.67-0.72).

Different strategies may be used to draw conclusions from the data generated by DNA microarrays in our study of the effect of estradiol (E2) on the transcriptome of the mammary gland of mice. We selected two strategies: the first one involving a classification by cellular process of regulated genes, and the second one taking advantage of gene expression profile over a time course of treatment. We also used two standardization methods, MAS5.0 and RMA, in order to assess their similarities and differences leading us to a better understanding of their impact on the results. In comparing expression patterns of regulated genes by E2, we observed that there are good similarities between gene expression profiles obtained by MAS5.0 and RMA. However, when the ratio between signal intensities of treatment and control is low, differences between data normalized by MAS 5.0 and RMA are more apparent, i.e. where the discrimination between biological and technical variability is the least obvious.Keywords: Time course.

    "text": "Expression data from HDAC1 and HDAC2 knocked-out mouse oocyte. Dramatic changes in chromatin structure and histone modification occur during oocyte growth, as well as a global cessation of transcription. The role of histone modifications in these processes is poorly understood. We report the effect of conditionally deleting Hdac1 and Hdac2 on oocyte development. Deleting either gene has little or no effect on oocyte development, whereas deleting both genes results in follicle development arrest at the secondary follicle stage. This developmental arrest is accompanied by substantial perturbation of the transcriptome and a global reduction in transcription even though histone acetylation is markedly increased. There is no apparent change in histone repressive marks but there is a pronounced decrease in histone H3K4 methylation, an activating mark. The decrease in H3K4 methylation is likely due to increased expression of Kdm5b because RNAi-mediated targeting of Kdm5b in double mutant oocytes results in an increase in H3K4 methylation. An increase in TRP53 acetylation also occurs in mutant oocytes and may contribute to the observed increased incidence of apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest seminal roles of acetylation of histone and non-histone proteins in oocyte development.We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying oocyte development and identified distinct classes of regulated genes during this process. Total RNA was extracted from 80 oocytes isolated from mice 12 days-of-age using the PicoPure RNA kit (Arcturus), amplified with the Ovation Pico WTA system (NuGen), and then fragmented and labeled with the FL-OvationTM cDNA Biotin Module V2 (NuGen).

Epithelial cell adhesion molecule EpCAM is a single transmembrane protein, which is involved in numerous cellular processes including cell adhesion, proliferation, maintenance of stemness of embryonic cells and progenitors, migration, and invasion. Activation of signal transduction by EpCAM is warranted by regulated intramembrane proteolysis and nuclear translocation of the intracellular domain EpICD. Here, we describe matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP-7) as a target gene of EpCAM signalling via EpICD nuclear translocation. EpCAM and MMP-7 expression pattern and levels positively correlated in vitro and in vivo, and were strongly elevated in primary carcinomas of the head and neck area. Hence, MMP-7 is a novel target of EpCAM signalling.FaDu hypopharynx carcinoma cells were transiently transfected with a control siRNA or an EpCAM-specific siRNA. After two days, expression of EpCAM was assessed upon flow cytometry with antibodies, which specifically bind within the EGF-repeat in the extracellular domain of EpCAM (Balzar, et al., 1999). Compared to control siRNA, EpCAM siRNA induced a mean 43% reduction of EpCAM expression at the cell surface. Reduction of EpCAM expression upon siRNA treatment was confirmed by RT-PCR and qPCR. EpCAM down-regulation resulted in diminished cell proliferation assessed upon cell counting. The observed 43% decrease in cell surface expression of EpCAM translated in cell numbers diminished by 35%. This is a confirmation of earlier findings on the reduced proliferation of breast and colon cancer cell lines following siRNA-mediated knock-down of EpCAM (Maetzel, et al., 2009, Munz, et al., 2004, Osta, et al., 2004). Equal amounts of total RNA (RIN score = 10) from control- and EpCAM-siRNA-treated FaDu cells were next subjected to a single, explorative cDNA microarray analysis with the aim to identify potential target genes of the signal transduction cascade of EpCAM. All genes, which were up- or down-regulated by at least two-fold (>2-fold; 716 genes up-regulated, 552 genes down-regulated), were then subjected to a Panther classification software analysis (http://www.pantherdb.org/). Special emphasis was put on the regulation of genes associated with signalling pathways. Angiogenesis, Alzheimer's disease-presenilin pathway, Wnt signalling pathway, inflammation and cadherin signalling pathways were most strongly affected by EpCAM knock-down. mRNA levels of selected genes differently regulated following partial knock-down of EpCAM included the co-regulated genes for secreted frizzled-related protein 5, protocadherin 10, dickkopf homolog 2, MMP24, SPARC, Myst3, ErbB4, MMP12, WISP2, MMP7, Nanos1, WNT9A, and the counter-regulated genes for MMP11, fibronectin 1, DACT3, WNT2B, WNT5A, APC2, Spondin 1, and catenina2. All genes except for protocadherin 10, Myst3, ErbB4, and WNT2B were validated in RT-PCR assays. Since several matrix metalloproteases were regulated after EpCAM knock-down and EpCAM is known to correlate with invasion, we chose this protein family for in-depth analysis. Matrix metalloprotease 7 (MMP-7) is a soluble factor, which, unlike other family members, is preferentially expressed in epithelial cells (Wilson, et al., 1995). Since EpCAM also displays highest expression in epithelia, we chose to proceed with the analysis of MMP7. SiRNA-mediated knock-down of EpCAM resulted in a comparable 50% down-regulation of MMP7 mRNA levels in RT-PCR and qPCR.

Examination of the intersection of KAP1 and Paupar transcriptional targets showed that Paupar and KAP1 control expression of a shared set of target genes that are enriched for regulators of neuronal function and cell cycle in N2A cells. Furthermore, CHART-seq and ChIP-seq derived Paupar-KAP1 genome-wide co-occupancy maps revealed a 4-fold enrichment of overlap between Paupar and KAP1 bound sequences on chromatin. This study also indicates that Paupar promotes KAP1 chromatin occupancy and H3K9me3 deposition at a subset of distal targets, through formation of a ribonucleoprotein complex containing Paupar, KAP1 and the PAX6 transcription factor.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset and fast progression neurodegenerative disease that leads to the loss of motor neurons. Mechanisms of selective motor neuron loss in ALS are unknown. The early events occurring in the spinal cord that may contribute to motor neuron death are not described, neither astrocytes participation in the pre-symptomatic phases of the disease. In order to identify ALS early events, we performed a microarray analysis employing a whole mouse genome platform to evaluate the gene expression pattern of lumbar spinal cords of transgenic SOD1G93A mice and their littermate controls at pre-symptomatic ages of 40 and 80 days. Differentially expressed genes were identified by means of the Bioconductor packages Agi4x44Preprocess and limma. FunNet web based tool was used for analysis of over-represented pathways. Furthermore, immunolabeled astrocytes from 40 and 80 days old mice were submitted to laser microdissection and RNA was extracted for evaluation of a selected gene by qPCR. Statistical analysis has pointed to 492 differentially expressed genes (155 up and 337 down regulated) in 40 days and 1105 (433 up and 672 down) in 80 days old ALS mice. The KEGG pathways tight junction, antigen processing and presentation, oxidative phosphorylation, endocytosis, chemokine signaling pathway, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis and glutamatergic synapse were found over-represented at both 40 and 80 days pre-symptomatic ages. Ube2i gene expression was evaluated in astrocytes from both transgenic ages, being up regulated in 40 and 80 days astrocytes enriched samples. Our data points to important early molecular events occurring in pre-symptomatic phases of ALS in mouse model. Early SUMOylation process linked to astrocytes might account to non autonomous cell toxicity in ALS. Further studies on the signaling pathways presented here may provide new insights to better understand the events triggering motor neuron death in this devastating disorder.

Breast cancer exhibits significant molecular, pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Current clinicopathological evaluation is imperfect for predicting outcome, which results in overtreatment for many patients, and for others, leads to death from recurrent disease. Therefore, additional criteria are needed to better personalize care and maximize treatment effectiveness and survival. To address these challenges, the Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network - Breast (SCAN-B) consortium was initiated in 2010 as a multicenter prospective study with longsighted aims to 1) analyze breast cancers with next-generation genomic technologies for translational research in a population-based manner and integrated with healthcare; 2) decipher fundamental tumor biology from these analyses; 3) utilize genomic data to develop and validate new clinically-actionable biomarker assays; and 4) build the infrastructure for real-time clinical implementation of molecular diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive tests. In the first phase, we focus on molecular profiling by next-generation RNA-sequencing on the Illumina platform. In the three years from August 30, 2010 through August 31, 2013, we have consented and enrolled 3,979 patients with primary breast cancer at the seven hospital sites in South Sweden, representing approximately 85% of eligible patients in the catchment area. Pre-operative blood samples have been collected for 3,942 (99%) patients and primary tumor specimens collected for 2,929 (74%) patients. Herein we describe the study infrastructure and present initial proof of concept results from prospective RNA-sequencing including tumor molecular subtyping and detection of driver gene mutations. We demonstrate that large-scale population-based collection and RNA-sequencing analysis of breast cancer is feasible.

The main goal of the project is to develop a new generation of bioinformatics resources for the integrative analysis of multiple types of omics data. These resources include both novel statistical methodologies as well as user-friendly software implementations. STATegra methods address many aspects of the omics data integration problem such as the design of multiomics experiments, integrative transcriptional and regulatory networks, integrative variable selection, data fusion, integration of public domain data, and integrative pathway analysis. To support method development STATegra uses a model biological system, namely the differentiation process of mouse pre-B-cells. The STATegra consortium generated data focused on a critical step in the differentiation of B lymphocytes, which are key components of the adaptive immune system. Transcription factors of the Ikaros family are central to the normal differentiation of B cell progenitors and their expression increases in response to developmental stage-specific signals to terminate the proliferation of B cell progenitors and to initiate their differentiation. In particular, a novel biological system that models the transition from the pre-BI stage to the pre-BII subsequent stage, where B cell progenitors undergo growth arrest and differentiation, was used. The approach involves a pre-B cell line, B3 , and an inducible version of the Ikaros transcription factor, Ikaros-ERt2. Ikaros factors act to down-regulate genes that drive proliferation and to simultaneously up-regulate the expression of genes that promote the differentiation of B cell progenitors. Hence, in the B3 system, before induction of Ikaros, cells proliferate and their gene expression pattern is similar to proliferating B cell progenitors in vivo. Following Ikaros induction, B3 cells undergo gene expression changes that resemble those that occur in vivo during the transition from cycling to resting pre-B cells, followed by a marked reduction in cellular proliferation and by G1 arrest. On this system the consortium has created a high-quality data collection consisting of a replicated time course using seven different omics platforms: RNA-seq, miRNA-seq, ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, Methyl-seq, proteomics and metabolomics, which is used to assess and to validate STATegra methods. The STATegra experimental design consists of a 6 point, time course that captures the differentiation of B3 cells containing Ikaros-ERt2 upon Ikaros induction within a 24 hours period. The differentiation was sampled at 0h, 2h, 6h, 12h, 18h and 24h after Ikaros induction by Tamoxifen. As control, B3 cells transfected with an empty vector were treated and sampled in the same way as the inducible line. Eight different omic technologies were measured on this system: RNA-seq, miRNA-seq, DNase-seq, RRBS-seq, ChIP-seq, scRNA-seq, Proteomics and Metabolomics.

Human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) is the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma and is associated with the angioproliferative disorders primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). We have previously described evidence of HHV-8 infection within the pulmonary vasculature of patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). We speculated that viral infection of the pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells could cause the angioproliferative phenotype characteristic of severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We now demonstrate the ability of HHV-8 to infect human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVECs) in vitro, confirming both latent and lytic infection. HHV-8 infection of HPMVECs resulted in significant changes of gene expression including alterations of pathways integral to both cellular apoptosis and angiogenesis. This infection also results in alterations of genes integral to the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) pathway, including down regulation of bone morphogenic protein receptor 1a (BMPR1a) and bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4). Other genes previously implicated in the development of PAH are also altered in expression by HHV-8 infection. These include increased expression of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-1, MMP-2 and MMP-10. Lastly, cells infected with HHV-8 apoptosis resistant.

We overexpressed constitutively active mutant of FOXO1 fused in frame with estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain (FOXO1(3A)ER), which can be activated by 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), in cHL cell lines KM-H2 and L428.

Of note, FOXO1 repressed transcription of several cytokines and cytokine receptors, which are known tobe involved in pathogenesis of cHL (e.g. CCL5, CXCR5, TNFRSF8).

A unifying characteristic of aggressive cancers is a profound anabolic shift in metabolism to enable sustained proliferation and biomass expansion. The ribosome is centrally situated to sense metabolic states but whether it impacts systems that promote cellular survival is unknown. Here, through integrated chemical-genetic analyses, we find that a dominant transcriptional effect of blocking protein translation in cancer cells is complete inactivation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), a multifaceted transcriptional regulator of the heat-shock response and many other cellular processes essential for tumorigenesis. Translational flux through the ribosome reshapes the transcriptional landscape and links the fundamental anabolic processes of protein production and energy metabolism with HSF1 activity.

Here, we assessed a role for mitochondria and analyzed gene expression in cAMP/PKA-promoted apoptosis by comparing wild-type (WT) S49 lymphoma cells and the S49 variant, D- (cAMP-deathless), which lacks cAMP-promoted apoptosis but has wild-type levels of PKA activity and cAMP-promoted G1 growth arrest. Treatment of WT, but not D-, S49 cells with 8-CPT-cAMP for 24 h induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and Smac and increase in caspase-3 activity. Gene expression analysis (using Affymetrix 430 2.0 Arrays) revealed that WT and D- cells incubated with 8-CPT-cAMP have similar, but non-identical, extents of cAMP-regulated gene expression at 2h (~800 transcripts) and 6h (~1000 transcripts) (|Fold|>2, P<0.06); by contrast, at 24h ~2500 and ~1100 transcripts were changed in WT and D- cells, respectively. Using an approach that combined regression analysis, clustering and functional annotation to identify transcripts that showed differential expression between WT and D- cells, we found differences in cAMP-mediated regulation of mRNAs involved in transcriptional repression, apoptosis, the cell cycle, RNA splicing, Golgi and lysosomes. The 2 cell lines differed in CREB phosphorylation and expression of the transcriptional inhibitor Icer and in cAMP-regulated expression of genes in the Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) and Bcl families. The findings indicate that cAMP/PKA-promoted apoptosis of lymphoid cells occurs via mitochondrial-mediated events and imply that such apoptosis involves gene networks in multiple biochemical pathways.Keywords: time course.

Metastasis is the key determinant of poor prognosis for advanced-stage NSCLC patients. Although an important contributor to metastasis is cross-talk between tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor cells, its regulation is not fully understood. Expressed primarily in macrophages, scavenger receptor A1 (SR-A1) has been associated with lung tumorigenesis. Here, the mechanistic basis for the involvement of SR-A1 in lung cancer prognosis was investigated using population genetics, transcriptomics, and functional analyses. SR-A1 genetic variants were investigated for possible association with survival of advanced-stage NSCLC patients in the Harvard Lung Cancer Study cohort. Two SNPs (rs17484273, rs1484751) in SR-A1 were significantly associated with poor overall survival of NSCLC patients. Further, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas showed a considerable down-regulation of SR-A1 in lung tumor tissues. The association of SR-A1 with prognosis was validated in animal models in the context of lung cancer metastasis. Macrophages derived from SR-A1 knockout mice accelerated metastasis in a lung cancer mouse model. On the other hand, tumor cell seeding, migration, and invasion as well as macrophage accumulation in lung cancer tissue were enhanced in SR-A1 knockout mice. Furthermore, SR-A1 deficiency promoted up-regulation of serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) in macrophages, which appeared to be mediated by MAPK/Ikappa-B/NF-kappaB signaling. Further, SAA1 exposure promoted tumor cell invasion and macrophage migration in vitro and in vivo, but these effects were blocked by administration of an anti-SAA1 antibody. These findings suggest that SR-A1 may suppress lung cancer metastasis by down-regulating SAA1 production in macrophages. In the experimental metastasis model, 3 x 105 LLC cells were re-suspended in 200 uL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and injected into the tail vein of 8-week-old WT and SR-A1 KO female mice (B6.Cg-Msr1tm1Csk/J) to induce the pulmonary metastasis. Mice were euthanized after three weeks and the lungs were collected for analysis. Total RNA was extracted, purified, and assessed by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis and quantitated spectrophotometrically. cDNA labeled with a fluorescent dye (Cy3-dCTP) was produced by Eberwine's linear RNA amplification method and subsequent enzymatic reaction.

Activation of EN expression in mammary tissues by Whey acidic protein (Wap) promoter-driven Cre leads to fully penetrant, multifocal malignant breast cancer with short latency.

Interferon (IFN)-alpha causes high rates of depression and fatigue, and is used to investigate the impact of innate immune cytokines on brain and behavior. However, little is known about transcriptional profiles of circulating immune cells during chronic IFN-alpha administration. Accordingly, genome-wide transcriptional profiling was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 21 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus either awaiting IFN-alpha therapy (n=10) or after 12 weeks of IFN-alpha treatment (n=11). Significance analysis of microarray data identified 252 up-regulated gene transcripts, the majority of which were related to IFN-alpha/antiviral or innate-immune/inflammatory signaling. Of these upregulated genes, 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (OAS2) was the only gene that was differentially expressed in patients that developed IFN-alpha-induced depression/fatigue, and correlated with depression and fatigue scores at 12 weeks of IFN-alpha administration. Promoter-based bioinformatic and cellular origin analyses revealed IFN-alpha-induced increases in genes bearing transcription factor binding motifs (TFBMs) related to myeloid differentiation, IFN-alpha signaling, API and CREB/ATF family of transcription pathways, with changes derived primarily from monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Patients with high depression/fatigue scores demonstrated up-regulation of genes bearing TFBMs for myeloid differentiation, IFN-alpha and AP1 signaling, and down regulation of TFBMs for CREB/ATF-related transcription factors. Cellular origin analyses indicated a shift toward genes derived from CD8+T and NK cells in subjects with high depression/fatigue scores. These results reveal an antiviral and inflammatory transcriptional profile after 12 weeks IFN-alpha, accompanied by increased OAS2 expression, decreased CREB/ATF transcriptional control, and a shift from monocyte-derived genes to those of cytotoxic lymphocytes in IFN-alpha-induced depression/fatigue. Total RNA was isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained at 12 weeks from HCV patients treated with IFN-alpha plus ribavirin (n=11) and untreated HCV patients awaiting IFN-alpha/ribavirin therapy (control subjects, n=10).",

Although some studies demonstrated that GATA1 is also required for mast cell differentiation, the effect of complete ablation of GATA1 in mast cell differentiation has not been examined. Here, by using tamoxifen-inducible conditional Gata1 knockout mice, we show that the role of GATA1 in mast cell differentiation is less than previously anticipated in adult mice. Although systemic administration of tamoxifen resulted in complete ablation of GATA1 protein in bone marrow and spleen, cell number and distribution of peripheral tissue mast cells in Gata1-null mice were comparable to those in wild type mice. Bone marrow cells derived from Gata1-null mice differentiated into mast cells that express both c-Kit and IgE receptor a subunit. Finally, we show a line of evidence that GATA1 and GATA2 cooperatively regulate the expression of several mast cell-specific genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and quantitative RT-PCR analyses. These results indicate that GATA1 is dispensable for differentiation and maintenance of mast cells in postnatal hematopoiesis and the loss of GATA1 function is likely compensated by GATA2.

Human esophageal keratinocytes were retrovirally transfected with wild-type full length E-cadherin, dominant-negative E-cadherin and dominant-negative TGFb receptor type II. Grown in organotypic cultures on a collagen/matrigel matrix with embedded fibroblast, the generated cell lines were analyzed for their potential to invade into the underlying matrix. Each cell lines was grown in duplicate in organotypic culture and therefore 2 replicates analyzed. Gene expression changes in invasive versus non-invasive areas were analyzed after RNA isolation using laser-capture microdissection resulting in 2 samples representing a normal esophageal epithelium (Ecad), 2 each of dominant-negative Ecad (Ecyto) non-invasive and invasive. To model the genetic alterations in esophageal cancer dominant-negative E-cadherin and dominant-negative TGFb receptor type II (Ecyto-dnTGFR) were expressed and 2 samples each, non-invasive and invasive, analyzed.",

Here, we identify receptors expressed by Nppb-neurons and demonstrate the functional importance of these receptors as sensors of endogenous pruritogens released by mast cells. Our search for receptors in Nppb-neurons revealed that they express leukotriene, serotonin, and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors. Targeted cell ablation, calcium imaging of primary sensory neurons, and conditional receptor knockout studies demonstrate that these receptors induce itch by the direct stimulation of Nppb-neurons and neurotransmission through the canonical GRP-dependent spinal cord itch pathway.

Purpose: We aimed to investigate in depth the regulation of microRNA expression by hypoxia in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7, establish the relationship between microRNA expression and HIF binding sites, pri-miRNA transcription and microRNA processing gene expression.Methods: microRNA sequencing data and gene expression microarray data were generated from MCF-7 cells submitted to an hypoxia timecourse (16h, 32h and 48h at 1% Oxygen). Data was integrated to 500 published high-stringency HIF binding sites identified in MCF-7 cells.Results: We identified 41 microRNAs significantly up- and 28 down- regulated, of which 38 mature and 20 star forms are reported in conjunction with hypoxia for the first time. HIF-1a and HIF-2a binding sites within 50kb distance of microRNA loci were found by integration of HIF ChIP-seq data, showing overall association between binding sites and up-regulation. Gene expression profiling analysis showed no full coordination between pri-miRNA and microRNA expression, pointing towards additional levels of regulation. Several transcripts playing a role in microRNA processing were found regulated by hypoxia, of which two were HIF dependent.Conclusions: The data support the hypothesis that microRNA expression under hypoxia is regulated at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. HIF is involved at both levels, regulating the transcription of certain microRNAs and also the expression of key elements of the microRNA processing pathway. microRNA-seq profiles of MCF-7 exposed to hypoxia (1% Oxygen) for 16h (2 replicates), 32h (2 replicates) and 48h (2 replicates) and to normoxia (2 replicates) were generated using Illumina sequencing platform.",

    "text": "Neuron susceptibility to seizure-induced injury. Dingledine-5R01NS031373-10-2. Neurodegenerative brain disorders become more common in the aged. Most of these disorders are associated with or caused by selective death of certain neuronal subpopulations. The mechanisms underlying the differential vulnerability of certain neuronal populations are still largely unexplored and few neuroprotective treatments are available to date. Elucidation of these mechanisms may lead to a greater understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, preconditioning by a short seizure confers neuroprotection following a subsequent prolonged seizure. Our goal is to identify pathways that confer vulnerability and resistance to neurotoxic conditions by comparing the basal and preconditioned gene expression profiles of three differentially vulnerable hippocampal neuron populations.Hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons are highly susceptible to seizures and ischemia, whereas dentate gyrus granule cells are relatively resistant. A brief preconditioning seizure confers protection to the pyramidal cells. We will first determine gene expression profiles of untreated rat CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells, and dentate granule cells, using laser capture microscopy to obtain region-specific neuronal mRNA. We will then determine the effect of a brief preconditioning seizure, which is neuroprotective in CA1 and CA3, on these expression profiles.We hypothesize that common molecular mechanisms exist in neurons that determine their susceptibility to seizure-induced injury. Intrinsic differences in gene expression exist between hippocampal glutamatergic CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons, on the one hand, and dentate granule cells on the other, which contribute to the greater susceptibility of pyramidal neurons to degeneration in experimental stroke and epilepsy. We specifically hypothesize that differences in basal energy metabolism genes may confer differential susceptibility to neurodegeneration produced by seizures and ischemia.Anesthetized animals will be sacrificed by decapitation, and frozen 10 micron sections will be lightly stained with cresyl violet to identify cell layers in the hippocampus. Approximately 1000 neurons from each of the three cell layers will be isolated by LCM. Poly-A RNA will be amplified using a modified Eberwine protocol. The quality of our aRNA will be evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR of GluR6 and KA2 mRNA levels before we send the samples to the Center for labeling and hybridization to Affymetrix rat 230A arrays. We will provide a one-round amplification cDNA product to the center for labeling and hybridization.

Genetically modified mice have advanced our understanding of valve development and related pathologies. However, little is known with regard to human valve development.We aimed to derive a novel human pluripotent stem cell model in order to decode the early steps of human valvulogenesis. Human MesP1+mesodermal cells were differentiated toward the fate of second heart field progenitors and then to a selected population of pre-valvular endocardial cells. Gene arrays revealed that these human prevalvular cells (HPVC) express patterns of genes similar to those expressed in the atrioventricular canal (AVC) endocardium of E9.0 mouse embryos. In mice this developmental time precedes endocardial mesenchymal transition (EndoMT),which is required for mature valve formation. HPVC treated with BMP2, cultured onto chick or mouse AVC cushions, or transplanted into the outflow tract or AVC of embryonic chick and mouse hearts, underwent EndoMTin both a Notch-dependent and independent-manner and expressed markers of valve mesenchymal cells and fibroblasts. Similar to the previously described valve interstitial cells (VICs), HPVC also differentiate into tendinous/chondrogenic cells.

Protection of the human respiratory system from exposure of volatile nanoparticles has become an emerging health concern. The understanding of the biological processes involved in the development and maintenance of a variety of pathologies is improved by genome-wide approaches. Technical feasibility of this type of experiment has perfected in recent years, but data analysis remains challenging. In this context, gene set analysis has emerged as a fundamental tool for the interpretation of the results. We demonstrate how the use of a combination of gene-by-gene and gene set analyses can enhance the interpretation of results. Gene set analyses are able to distinguish responses due to nanoparticle size also discriminating between long and short time recovery after exposure. Transcription regulation and cell proliferation modulation appear to be an early response while oxidative stress and mitochondrial perturbation are late response. Moreover, smaller the particle higher the effect on inflammatory response and DNA damage activation.

We sought to identify a potential gene expression signature in non-dysplastic distal mucosa that as a \"genetic field effect\" could be a marker for remote neoplastic lesions.Results: 468 genes were significantly up-regulated and 541 genes were significantly down-regulated >2-fold in UC patients with neoplasia compared to UC patients without neoplasia. Nine genes (ACSL1, BIRC3, CLC, CREM, ELTD1, FGG, S100A9, THBD, and TPD52L1) were progressively and significantly up-regulated from controls to quiescent non-dysplastic UC to UC with neoplasia. Immunostaining of proteins revealed increases in tissue expression of S100A9 and REG1 in UC-associated cancer and in non-dysplastic tissue from UC patients harboring remote neoplasia, compared to UC patients without dysplasia and normal controls.Conclusions: Gene expression changes occur as a field effect in UC patients without active inflammation who harbor a remote dysplastic lesion. Further characterization of these genes and proteins might elucidate pathways of carcinogenesis in IBD and lead to the development of more accurate, less invasive markers of dysplasia in those at increased risk. Microarray assay were conducted on 20 RNA samples isolated from colon mucosa of 20 patients. Of these patients, 5 were normal controls, 4 had quiescent UC, and 11 had UC with neoplasia.

The objective of this study was to compare the transcriptional repertoire of mature human neutrophils before and after GM-CSF treatment by using oligonucleotide microarrays.Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is an important pro-inflammatory lipid mediator generated by neutrophils upon activation. Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stimulation is known to enhance agonist-mediated LTB4 production of neutrophils within minutes, a process called \"priming\". Here, we demonstrate that GM-CSF also limits the production of LTB4 by neutrophils via a transcriptional mechanism at later time points. We identified hematopoietic specific Ras homologous (RhoH)/translocation three four (TTF), which was induced following GM-CSF stimulation in neutrophils, as a key regulator in this process. Neutrophils derived from RhoH/TTF-deficient (Rhoh-/-) mice demonstrated increased LTB4 production upon activation compared with normal mouse neutrophils. Moreover, neutrophils from cystic fibrosis patients expressed enhanced levels of RhoH/TTF and generated less LTB4 upon activation compared with normal human neutrophils. Taken together, these data suggest that RhoH/TTF represents an inducible feedback inhibitor in neutrophils that is involved in the limitation of innate immune responses. 3 healthy donors' blood were used for each group. Two groups were created. One group (\"untreated\"=N ) the RNA were extracted immediately after isolation of blood neutrophil.

MEIS2 has an important role in development and organogenesis, and is implicated in the pathogenesis of human cancer. The molecular basis of MEIS2 action in tumorigenesis is not clear. Here, we show that MEIS2 is highly expressed in human neuroblastoma cell lines and is required for neuroblastoma cell survival and proliferation. Depletion of MEIS2 in neuroblastoma cells leads to M phase arrest and mitotic catastrophe, whereas ectopic expression of MEIS2 markedly enhances neuroblastoma cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenicity. Gene expression profiling reveals an essential role of MEIS2 in maintaining the expression of a large number of late cell cycle genes, including those required for DNA replication, G2-M checkpoint control and M phase progression. Importantly, we identify MEIS2 as a transcription activator of the MuvB-BMYB-FOXM1 complex that functions as a master regulator of mitotic gene expression. Further, we show that FOXM1 is a direct target gene of MEIS2 and is required for MEIS2 to upregulate mitotic genes. These findings link a development gene to the control of cell cycle progression and suggest that high MEIS2 expression is a molecular mechanism for high expression of mitotic genes that is commonly observed in cancers of poor prognosis.

Mouse models of medulloblastoma are compared to human subgroups through microarray expression and other measures. This study contrasts mouse medullablastomas from a range of mouse genetic models.

Emerging evidence indicates that noncoding RNAs play important regulatory roles during aging and the development of chronic disease. The functional roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in physiology and disease are under intense examination. However, little is known about lncRNAs in the context of human aging and socio-environmental conditions. Microarray profiling of lncRNAs and mRNAs in young and old white and African American (AA) males living above or below poverty revealed robust changes in both lncRNAs and mRNAs with age and poverty status in white males, but not in AA males. We validated the changes in lncRNAs in an expanded cohort; CDT-3247F14.2, GAS5, H19, TERC and MEG3 changed significantly with age, whereas AK022914, GAS5, KB-1047C11.2, MEG3 and XLOC_003262 changed significantly with poverty. Pathway analysis revealed that mitochondrial function and response to DNA damage and stress were enriched in younger individuals. Pathways of response to stress, viral infection, and immune signals were enriched in individuals living above poverty. These data show that both human age and a marker of social adversity influence lncRNA expression patterns. These data may provide insight into the molecular pathways underlying aging and social factors that affect disparities in aging and disease. Long noncoding RNAs and mRNAs were analyzed by microarray from PBMCs from young (~30 yrs, n=8) and old (~64, n=8) white males above and below poverty.",

WAS is caused by mutations in the protein WASP which impair its interaction with the WIPF1 protein. Here, we aim to identify a module of WIPF1-coexpressed genes and to assess its use as a prognostic signature for colorectal cancer, glioma, and breast cancer patients. Two public colorectal cancer microarray data sets were used for discovery and validation of the WIPF1 co-expression module. Based on expression of the WIPF1 signature, we classified more than 400 additional tumors with microarray data from our own experiments or from publicly available data sets according to their WIPF1 signature expression. This allowed us to separate patient populations for colorectal cancers, breast cancers, and gliomas for which clinical characteristics like survival times and times to relapse were analyzed. Groups of colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and glioma patients with low expression of the WIPF1 co-expression module generally had a favorable prognosis. In addition, the majority of WIPF1 signature genes are individually correlated with disease outcome in different studies. Literature gene network analysis revealed that among WIPF1 co-expressed genes known direct transcriptional targets of c-myc, ESR1 and p53 are enriched. The mean expression profile of WIPF1 signature genes is correlated with the profile of a proliferation signature. The WIPF1 signature is the first microarray-based prognostic expression signature primarily developed for colorectal cancer that is instrumental in other tumor types: low expression of the WIPF1 module is associated with better prognosis.We used microarrays for the validation of a WIPF1 co-expression module which was developed on two publically available datasets.Keywords: disease state analysis.

The PAF complex (Paf1C) has been shown to regulate chromatin modifications, gene transcription, and PolII elongation. Here, we provide the first genome-wide analysis of chromatin occupancy by the entire PAF complex in mammalian cells. We show that Paf1C is recruited not only to promoters and gene bodies, but also to regions downstream of cleavage/polyadenylation (pA) sites at 3' ends, a profile that sharply contrasted with the yeast complex. Remarkably, our studies identified novel, subunit-specific links between Paf1C and regulation of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) and upstream antisense transcription. Moreover, we found that depletion of Paf1C subunits also resulted in the accumulation of RNA polymerase II (PolII) over gene bodies, which coincided with APA. Depletion of specific Paf1C subunits leads to global loss of histone H2B ubiquitylation, but surprisingly, there is little impact of Paf1C depletion on other histone modifications, including the tri-methylation of histone H3 on lysines 4 and 36 (H3K4me3 and H3K36me3), previously associated with this complex. Our results provide surprising differences with yeast, while unifying observations that link Paf1C with PolII elongation and RNA processing, and suggest that Paf1C could play a role in protecting transcripts from premature cleavage by preventing PolII accumulation at TSS-proximal pA sites.

The aim of the current study was to identify novel disease-associated genes in purified monocytes, including both genes associated with predisposition or with disease course, using the unique model of MZ twins. Thus the transcriptome and methylome were compared between twins discordant and concordant for the diseases, as well as MG singletons, and healthy controls. Several transcripts associated with immune homeostasis and inflammation resolution were highlighted in the current study. High similarity between the healthy and the MG discordant twins found, suggest that genetic predisposition may have a stronger contribution then previously assumed.

Objectives: We compared metabolic biomarkers in the blood and PBMC gene expression profiles among normal weight, mildly obese, and moderately obese Korean adult men. Design: Subjects were classified as normal weight (BMI, 18.5~23 kg/m2), mildly obese (BMI, 25~27.5 kg/m2), and moderately obese (BMI, 27.5~30 kg/m2). Results: High leptin, lipids (except LDL- and HDL-cholesterol), and apolipoprotein B levels and low adiponectin and HDL-cholesterol levels were present in the plasma of both mildly and moderately obese subjects. Circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a and IL-6) and markers of insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and liver damage were altered in moderately obese subjects but not mildly obese subjects. PBMC transcriptome data showed enrichment of pathways involved in energy metabolism, insulin resistance, bone metabolism, cancer, inflammation, and fibrosis in both mildly and moderately obese subjects. Signaling pathways involved in oxidative phosphorylation; triglyceride synthesis; carbohydrate metabolism; insulin, mTOR, FOXO, RAP1, RAS, and TGF-b signaling; and ECM-receptor interaction were enriched only in moderately obese subjects, indicating that changes in PBMC gene expression profiles according to metabolic disturbances were associated with the development and/or aggravation of obesity. In particular, upregulation of 8 genes (FLT3LG, LTB, IL23A, CD19, CPT1B, AXIN2, CACNA1L, RPRM) and downregulation of 2 genes (CCL4L1, LPAR5) were observed only in mildly obese subjects.

These results suggested that these genes could be used as early or stable biomarkers for diagnosing and treating obesity-associated metabolic disturbance. Total RNA of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was obtained from normal weight (BMI, 18.5~23 kg/m2), mildly obese (BMI, 25~27.5 kg/m2) and moderately obese (BMI, 27.5~30 kg/m2) subjects and mRNA expression was measured using microarray analysis.",

    "text": "Effect of histone deacetylase inhibitors on osteoblast gene expression. Background:Osteoblast differentiation requires the coordinated stepwise expression of multiple genes. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) accelerate the osteoblast differentiation process by blocking the activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs), which alter gene expression by modifying chromatin structure. We previously demonstrated that HDIs and HDAC3 shRNAs accelerate matrix mineralization and the expression of osteoblast maturation genes (e.g. alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin). Identifying other genes that are differentially regulated by HDIs might identify new pathways that contribute to osteoblast differentiation.Results:To identify other osteoblast genes that are altered early by HDIs, we incubated MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts with HDIs (trichostatin A, MS-275, or valproic acid) for 18 hours in osteogenic conditions. The promotion of osteoblast differentiation by HDIs in this experiment was confirmed by osteogenic assays. Gene expression profiles relative to vehicle-treated cells were assessed by microarray analysis with Affymetrix GeneChip 430 2.0 arrays. The regulation of several genes by HDIs in MC3T3-E1 cells and primary osteoblasts was verified by quantitative real-time PCR. Nine genes were differentially regulated by at least two-fold after exposure to each of the three HDIs and six were verified by PCR in osteoblasts. Four of the verified genes (solute carrier family 9 isoform 3 regulator 1 (Slc9a3r1), sorbitol dehydrogenase 1, a kinase anchor protein, and glutathione S-transferase alpha 4) were induced. Two genes (proteasome subunit, beta type 10 and adaptor-related protein complex AP-4 sigma 1) were suppressed. We also identified eight growth factors and growth factor receptor genes that are significantly altered by each of the HDIs, including Frizzled related proteins 1 and 4, which modulate the Wnt signaling pathway.Conclusions: This study identifies osteoblast genes that are regulated early by HDIs and indicates pathways that might promote osteoblast maturation following HDI exposure. One gene whose upregulation following HDI treatment is consistent with this notion is Slc9a3r1. Also known as NHERF1, Slc9a3r1 is required for optimal bone density. Similarly, the regulation of Wnt receptor genes indicates that this crucial pathway in osteoblast development is also affected by HDIs. These data support the hypothesis that HDIs regulate the expression of genes that promote osteoblast differentiation and maturation.Keywords: gene expression. To identify other osteoblast genes that are altered early by HDIs, we incubated MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts with HDIs (trichostatin A, MS-275, or valproic acid) or the vehicle control (DMSO) for 18 hours in osteogenic conditions.

Purpose: Epidemiological and intervention studies have attempted to link the health effects of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables with the consumption of polyphenols and their impact in neurodegenerative diseases. Studies have shown that polyphenols can cross the intestinal barrier and reach concentrations in the bloodstream able to exert effects in vivo. However, the effective uptake of polyphenols in the brain is still regarded with some reservations. Here we describe a combination of approaches to examine the putative transport of blackberry-digested polyphenols (BDP) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and ultimate evaluation of their beneficial effects.Methods: BDP was obtained by in vitro digestion of blackberry extract and BDP major aglycones (hBDP) were obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis. Chemical characterization and BBB permeability of extracts were evaluated by LC-Orbitrap MS. BBB permeability and cytoprotection of both extracts was assessed in HBMEC monolayers. Neuroprotective potential of BDP was assessed in NT2-derived 3D co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes and in mouse cerebellar granule cells. Microarray analysis of BDP-modulated genes was evaluated in SK-N-MC cells.Results: Components from BDP and hBDP proven to be BBB permeable. Physiologically-relevant concentrations of both extracts were cytoprotective at endothelial level and BDP revealed to be neuroprotective in advanced cell models. The major canonical pathways involved in the neuroprotective effect of BDP were unveiled, comprising mTOR signaling and the unfolded protein response pathway. Genes like ASNS and ATF5 emerged as novel BDP modulated targets.Conclusions: BBB permeability of BDP and hBDP components reinforce the health benefits of a diet rich in polyphenols in neurodegerative disorders context. Our results suggest some novel pathways and genes that may be involved in the neuroprotective mechanism of the BDP polyphenol components. Microarray analysis was performed on SK-N-MC cells incubated with in vitro digested extracts of commercial blackberry (BB) or of wild blackberry - Rubus vagabundus (RV) for 24h, with or without post-incubation with a stress inducer - hydrogen peroxide (S) .

Genes encoding their receptors and most other synaptic components were not differentially expressed. Differential expression of the neuropeptide genes was confirmed by qPCR analysis. In situ hybridization indicated that the difference in neuropeptide expression was uniform and not due to the loss of specific cells in the mutant. In primary sensory neurons, which do not depend on synaptic activity for their input, the differential expression of neuropeptides was not observed. These data reveal no simple relation between activity of synapses and expression of their resident proteins, but instead identified a unique feature of neuropeptide gene expression, which appears to depend on synaptic activity.Keywords: munc18-1 null mutant mice are characterized by the complete loss of both evoked and spontaneous transmitter release . 6 biological replicates of munc18-1 null mutants, hybridized with 6 pooled biological replicates.

Cardiac hypertrophy is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and heart failure. There is increasing evidence that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) and the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases. However, the ability to comprehensively study cardiac hypertrophy on a gene regulatory level is impacted by the limited availability of human cardiomyocytes. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) offer the opportunity for disease modeling.We utilized a previously established in vitro model of cardiac hypertrophy to interrogate the regulatory mechanism associated with the cardiac disease process. We performed miRNA sequencing and mRNA expression analysis on endothelin 1 (ET-1) stimulated hiPSC-CMs to describe associated RNA expression profiles. MicroRNA sequencing revealed over 250 known and 34 predicted novel miRNAs to be differentially expressed between ET-1stimulated and unstimulated control hiPSC-CMs. Messenger RNA expression analysis identified 731 probe sets with significant differential expression. Computational target prediction on significant differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs identified nearly 2000 target pairs. To characterize miRNA and mRNA expression patterns we utilized iCell Cardiomyocytes derived from human iPSCs (hiPSC-CMs).

Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway occurs in over 40% of bladder urothelial cancers. The aim of this study is to determine the therapeutic potential, the underlying action and resistant mechanisms of drugs targeting the PI3K pathway. Urothelial cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) were analyzed for alterations of the PI3K pathway and for their sensitivity to the small molecule inhibitor pictilisib alone and in combination with cisplatin and/or gemcitabine. Potential predictive biomarkers for pictilisib were evaluated and RNA-sequencing was performed to explore drug resistance mechanisms. The bladder cancer cell line TCCSUP, which harbors a PIK3CA E545K mutation, was sensitive to pictilisib compared to cell lines with wild type PIK3CA. Pictilisib exhibited stronger anti-tumor activity in bladder cancer PDX models with PI3KCA H1047R mutation or amplification than a model with wild-type. Pictilisib synergized with cisplatin and/or gemcitabine in vitro, significantly delayed tumor growth and prolonged survival compared with single drug targeted treatment in the PDX models. The phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 correlated with response to pictilisib both in vitro and in vivo, and could potentially serve as biomarker to predict response to pictilisib. The inhibitor activated the compensatory MEK/ERK pathway that likely contributed to pictilisib resistance, which was reversed by co-treatment with the RAF inhibitor sorafenib. RNA-sequencing of tumors resistant to treatment suggested that LSP1 down-regulation might play a role in inducing drug resistance. These preclinical results provide new insight into the therapeutic potential of targeting the PI3K pathway for the treatment of bladder cancer. A total of 9 samples were analyzed by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) in this study. The study included BL0269 bladder cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors derived from subcutaneous injection of tumor pieces into 10 mice. Mice were randomized into 5 treatment groups: control (untreated), cisplatin, pictilisib (GDC-0941), combination (cisplatin+pictilisib), and sequential (cisplatin -> pictilisib) treatments.

By using both in vivo and in vitro influenza infection models, we found that type I IFN-k, limited the replication of influenza viruses by stimulating a IFNAR-MAPK-cFos-CHD6 axis. Similarly, Zika virus (ZIKV) was also highly sensitive to IFN-k-mediated suppression. With an IAV infected mouse model, we found that IFN-k was the earliest responding type I interferon among all known members in mice after H9N2 infection, a low-pathogenic Avian Influenza, whereas this early induction did not occur upon highly pathogenic H7N9 infection. IFN-k can efficiently contain both low- and high-pathogenic influenza replication in cultured human lung cells, and CHD6 was the major effector responsive molecule for IFN-k, but not for IFN-a/b. Furthermore, we discovered that both IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 subunits of type I interferon receptor and their downstream axis of p38-cFos are engaged in IFN-k signaling cascade to acti vate CHD6, which didn't require STAT1 activity. In addition, we showed that the pre-treatment with IFN-k before IAV challenge protected mice from high mortality. Altogether, our study identified an IFN-k-specific pathway that suppressed influenza A virus in vitro and in vivo.

The aNAC (alpha chain of the Nascent polypeptide-Associated Complex) transcriptional coregulator is developmentally expressed in osteoblasts and regulates osteoblast differentiation in vitro and in vivo. aNAC can activate or repress gene transcription, a function that is dynamically regulated by post-translational modification. Phosphorylation of residue Ser132 stimulates the sumoylation of aNAC on Lys127 to repress gene expression. Using in vitro kinase assays, we show that Ser132 phosphorylation is mediated by the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). Pharmacological inhibition of DNA-PKcs kinase activity or gene silencing of Prkdc (encoding DNA-PKcs) in murine osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells and human adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells markedly enhanced osteogenesis and the expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes. ChIP-seq identified Ezh2 as a target of the aNAC/DNA-PKcs signaling pathway. Mechanistically, inhibition of DNA-PKcs repressed Ezh2 expression, induced cell cycle block, and increased osteogenesis by significantly enhancing the bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) response in osteoblasts and other mesenchymal cells. Importantly, in vivo inhibition of the kinase enhanced bone biomechanical properties, and bones from osteoblast-specific conditional Prkdc-knockout mice exhibited increased stiffness. In conclusion, DNA-PKcs is a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation, and therefore DNA-PKcs inhibitors may have therapeutic potential for bone regeneration and metabolic bone diseases.

They wish to supplement the data obtained with the Illumina platform with glycan-related expression data obtained with the Gene-chips to achieve a more complete understanding on how Caco2 cells respond to the presence of HMOs and B.infantis. The transcriptomics data is being complemented by qPCR based bacterial-epithelial cells binding assays, and glycan arrays assays for which they have initiated a collaboration with the CFG Core H (David Smith). The influence, signaling and adhesion between Bifidobacterium infantis, a probiotic microorganism abundant in infant feces, and Caco2 epithelial cells. Our hypothesis is that HMOs act as signaling molecules for both Caco2 cells and B. infantis to indicate the presence in the gut, of a nutrient niche adapted for the nourishment and recruitment of HMO-consuming probiotic microorganism. HMOs therefore could play a role in the expression and binding to GBPs both on epithelial cells and in probiotic gut microorganisms. Preliminary transcriptomics data analysis obtained by using the Illumina Human Ref-8 Expression Bead Chip, has revealed that co-incubation of Caco2 cells with HMO upregulates genes belonging to chemokines, adhesion molecules, growth factors and glycan degradation, thus indicating that HMOs are actively recognized by these cells. We are working on another set of transcriptomics experiments which will measure whether HMO elicit a differential response on Caco2 in the presence of B.infantis. We wish to supplement the data obtained with the Illumina platform with glycan-related expression data obtained with the Gene-chips to achieve a more complete understanding on how Caco2 cells respond to the presence of HMOs and B.infantis. The transcriptomics data is being complemented by qPCR based bacterial-epithelial cells binding assays, and glycan arrays assays for which we have initiated a collaboration with the CFG Core H (David Smith). We are requesting the analysis of 16 RNA samples from Caco2 cells on the Glyco-gene chips, for testing respectively 4 independent biological replicates for each of the 4 different co-incubation conditions.RNA preparations from Caco2 cells were sent to Microarray Core (E).

Trained immunity and immune tolerance have been identified as long-term response patterns of the innate immune system. The causes of these opposing reactions remain elusive. Here we report about differential inflammatory responses of microglial cells derived from neonatal mouse brain to increasing doses of the endotoxin LPS. Prolonged priming with ultra-low LPS doses provokes trained immunity, i.e. increased production of pro-inflammatory mediators in comparison to the unprimed control. In contrast, priming with high doses of LPS induces immune tolerance implying decreased production of inflammatory mediators and pronounced release of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Investigation of the signaling processes and cell functions involved in these memory-like immune responses reveals essential role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase g (PI3Kg), one of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase species highly expressed in innate immune cells. Together, our data suggest profound influence of preceding contacts with pathogens on the immune response of microglia. The impact of these interactions - trained immunity or immune tolerance - appears to be shaped by pathogen dose. Samples of murin microglial cells were analysed after one or two time treatment with LPS (12 samples: 3 treated once with LPS, 3 treated twice with LPS (high-dose), 3 treated twice with LPS (low-dose)).",

Methods:Genome-wide gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines was determined using microarrays derived from five discordant and four concordant MZ twin pairs with idiopathic absence epilepsies and five unaffected MZ twin pairs. Gene expression was analysed using three strategies: discordant MZ twins were compared as matched pairs, MZ twins concordant for epilepsy were compared to control MZ twins, and a singleton design of affected versus unaffected MZ twin individuals was used irrespective of twin pairing. An overlapping gene list was generated from these analyses. Dysregulation of genes recognised from the microarray experiment were validated using quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) in the twin sample and in an independent sample of 18 sporadic absence cases and 24 healthy controls.Results:Sixty-five probe sets were identified from the microarray analysis strategies. Sixteen genes were chosen for validation and nine of these genes confirmed by qRT-PCR in the twin sample. Differential expression of the immediate early gene EGR1 and RCN2, coding for the calcium-binding protein Reticulocalbin 2, was re-confirmed by qRT-PCR in the independent sample.Interpretation:Using a unique sample of discordant MZ twins, our study identified genes with altered expression, which suggest novel mechanisms in idiopathic absence epilepsy.

Side and off-target effects remain a difficult issue in the search of pharmaceutical leads, especially with DNA-binding molecules or genome editing methods where the issue becomes particularly thorny. A particular case is the investigations into the off-target effects of N-methylpyrrole-N-methylimidazole polyamides, a naturally inspired class of DNA binders that discriminately access the minor groove with strong affinity and sequence specificity but the relatively short motif of < 20 bases often imply possible non-unique genomic binding. Multiple binding sites may translate to binding at non-intended loci, potentially leading to off-target effects, issues that very few approaches are able to address to-date. We here report an analytical method of inferring off-target binding from expression profiling based on the relative impact to various biochemical pathways, as well as an accompanying side effect prediction engine to allow candidate polyamides to be systematically screened. This method marks the first attempt in PI polyamide research to identify elements in various biochemical pathways sensitive to the treatment of a candidate polyamide to infer possible off-target effects. Expression changes were then considered for their possible effect on outward phenotypic changes, manifested as side effects, should the same PI polyamide candidate be administered clinically. We also performed a series of animal experiments to validate some of these effects, and found some corroboration in certain side effect manifestations, such as changes in the level of aspartate transaminase in ICR and nude mice after injection of some of the candidate polyamides in this study.

    "text": "Dissection of transcriptional and cis-regulatory control of differentiation in human pancreatic cancer [RNA-seq]. The histological grade of carcinomas describes the ability of tumor cells to organize differentiated epithelial structures and has prognostic impact. Molecular control of differentiation in normal and cancer cells relies on lineage-determining transcription factors (TFs) that activate the repertoire of cis-regulatory elements controlling cell type-specific transcriptional outputs. TF recruitment to cognate genomic DNA binding sites results in the deposition of histone marks characteristic of enhancers and other cis-regulatory elements. Here we integrated transcriptomics and genome-wide analysis of chromatin marks in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells of different grade to identify first, and then experimentally validate the sequence-specific TFs controlling grade-specific gene expression. We identified a core set of TFs with a pervasive binding to the enhancer repertoire characteristic of differentiated PDACs and controlling different modules of the epithelial gene expression program. Defining the regulatory networks that control the maintenance of epithelial differentiation of PDAC cells will help determine the molecular basis of PDAC heterogeneity and progression. Poly(A) fraction of the total RNA from human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines was extracted and subjected to by multiparallel sequencing.

    "text": "TRIBAL overexpression in HepG2 cells. Objective - The TRIB1 locus has been linked to hepatic triglyceride metabolism in mice and to plasma triglycerides and coronary artery disease (CAD) in humans. The lipid associated SNPs identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are located ~ 30 kb downstream from TRIB1 suggesting complex regulatory effects on genes or pathways relevant to hepatic triglyceride metabolism. The goal of this study was to investigate the functional relationship between common SNPs at the TRIB1 locus and plasma lipid traits.Methods & Results - Characterization of the risk locus reveals that it encompasses a gene, TRIB1 associated locus (TRIBAL) comprised of a well conserved promoter region and an alternatively spliced transcript. Bioinformatic analysis and re-sequencing identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2001844, within the promoter region that associates with increased plasma triglycerides, reduced HDL-C and CAD risk. Furthermore, we show that rs2001844 is an expression trait locus (eQTL) for TRIB1 expression in blood and alters TRIBAL promoter activity in a reporter assay model. The TRIBAL transcript has features typical of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA), including poor sequence conservation. Modulation of TRIBAL expression had limited impact on either TRIB1 or lipid regulatory genes mRNA levels in human hepatocyte models. In contrast, TRIB1 knockdown markedly increased TRIBAL expression in HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes.Conclusions - These studies demonstrate an interplay between a novel locus,TRIBAL, and TRIB1. TRIBAL is located in the GWAS identified risk locus, responds to altered expression of TRIB1, harbors a risk SNP that is an eQTL for TRIB1 expression and associates with plasma triglyceride concentrations. HepG2 hepatoma cells were stably infected with TRIBAL1 or no insert carrying lentiviruses.",

Activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway is one the most frequent genetic events in human cancer. Therefore, the development of PI3K inhibitors has attracted much attention.

Here we report the gene expression signatures of MCF7 cells treated with ETP-45658 or the reference PI3K inhibitor PI-103.

Treatment with ETP-45658 or PI-103 resulted in a time and concentration-dependent decrease in phosphorylation of AKT Ser473 in MCF7 cells. We conducted microarray analysis examining the gene expression profile in MCF7 cells at six hours post ETP-45658 or PI-103 incubation. Both compounds induced the expression of negative cell cycle regulators including Cyclin G2, p27kip1 and ING4 and decreased positive regulators such as Cyclin D1 without significantly affecting the expression of pro-apoptotic genes. We found FOXO transcription factor binding sites over-represented in both up- and down-regulated genes but not in those without significant changes.

However, the latter assay has been interpreted by some as one type of human-animal chimera and studies involving human-animal chimerism present a wide range of ethical issues with restrictive legislation in some countries. The need for teratoma assays is compelling because unproven differentiation may suggest a dangerously flawed cell resource for use in future therapies.

We studied transcriptional changes by Affymetrix human microarrays in DLBCL cell lines as a result of treatment with GSK126, a potent, highly-selective, SAM-competitive, small molecule inhibitor of EZH2In eukaryotes, epigenetic post-translational modification of histones is critical for regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. EZH2 is the catalytic subunit of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and is responsible for repressing target gene expression through methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27). Over-expression of EZH2 is implicated in tumorigenesis and correlates with poor prognosis in multiple tumor types. Recent reports have identified somatic heterozygous mutations of Y641 and A677 residues within the catalytic SET domain of EZH2 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). The Y641 residue is the most frequently mutated residue, with 22% of GCB (Germinal Cell B-cell) DLBCL and FL harboring mutations at this site. These lymphomas exhibit increased H3K27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) due to altered substrate preferences of the mutant enzymes. However, it is unknown whether direct inhibition of EZH2 methyltransferase activity alone will be effective in treating lymphomas carrying activating EZH2 mutations. Herein, we demonstrate that GSK126, a potent, highly-selective, SAM-competitive, small molecule inhibitor of EZH2 methyltransferase activity, decreases global H3K27me3 levels and reactivates silenced PRC2 target genes. GSK126 effectively inhibits the proliferation of EZH2 mutant DLBCL cell lines and dramatically inhibits the growth of EZH2 mutant DLBCL xenografts in mice. Together, these data demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 activity may provide a promising treatment for EZH2 mutant lymphoma. 10 DLBCL cell lines (7 mutant and 3 wild type EZH2), that were differentially sensitive to GSK126 in proliferation assays, were treated for 72 hours, in duplicate (n=2), with either DMSO (vehicle) or 500nM of GSK126, a potent selective EZH2 inhibitor.

In skeletal muscle differentiation, muscle-specific genes are regulated by two groups of transcription factors, the MyoD and MEF2 families, which work together to drive the differentiation process. Here we show that ERK5 regulates muscle cell fusion through Klf transcription factors. The inhibition of ERK5 activity suppresses muscle cell fusion with minimal effects on the expression of MyoD, MEF2, and their target genes. Promoter analysis coupled to microarray assay reveals that Klf-binding motifs are highly enriched in the promoter regions of ERK5-dependent upregulated genes. Remarkably, Klf2 and Klf4 expression are also upregulated during differentiation in an ERK5-dependent manner, and knockdown of Klf2 or Klf4 specifically suppresses muscle cell fusion. Moreover, we show that the Sp1 transcription factor links ERK5 to Klf2/4, and that nephronectin, a Klf transcriptional target, is involved in muscle cell fusion. Therefore, an ERK5/Sp1/Klf module plays a key role in the fusion process during skeletal muscle differentiation. To identify those genes whose expression levels are regulated by the ERK5 pathway in differentiating C2C12 cells, we performed genome-wide analysis by using Affymetrix GeneChip oligonucleotide microarrays. We performed two independent experiments. For each experiment, we used five samples: cells in growth medium (0 day), lacZ-infected cells at two time points (2.5 days and 4.5 days of differentiation) and dnMEK5-infected cells at two time points (2.5 days and 4.5 days of differentiation).

Due to the urgent need of new targeting strategies in PCa, AR interacting proteins should be considered. In this study we aimed to test the effect of a long-term knockdown of NCOA1, an AR coactivator, in PCa progression and metastatogenesis and whether NCOA1 could be used as a possible therapeutic target. To test the consequences of NCOA1 knockdown on proliferation, we performed by 3H thymidine incorporation assays revealing a strong reduction in castration resistant MDA PCa 2b and androgen-dependent LNCaP cells, without affecting AR negative PC3 cells. Furthermore, Boyden chamber assays revealed a strong decrease in migration and invasion upon NCOA1 knockdown. Using a cDNA microarray, we identified protein kinase D1 (PRKD1) as one prominent upregulated gene in MDA PCa 2b, which was not seen in PC3 cells. Knockdown of PRKD1 clearly reverted the reduced migratory potential. Moreover, we found phospholipase A2, group7 (PLA2G7) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2 (EIF5A2), which might be involved in migration of PC3 cells. Further, we can clearly demonstrate that PRKD1 is negatively regulated by the AR/NCOA1 complex. In addition, immunhistochemical staining revealed a strong increase in NCOA1 expression in matched and unmatched patients' samples, respectively between normal prostate and primary tumor. Regarding the PRKD1 staining, no final conclusion can be drawn in terms of a tumor suppressor function. Thus, our findings directly associate NCOA1/AR complex with PRKD1 regulation and further suggest NCOA1 as a potential therapeutic target also due to the effect on PC3 cell migration. Cell lines with a stable knockdown of NCOA1 were generated by lentiviral-based transduction of shRNA vectors. For each of the two cell lines MDA and PC3, gene expression profiles were generated for KO and CTRL samples with 3 biological replicates for each. Differential expression analysis was performed by comparing the gene expression estimates between KO and CTRL samples for each cell line.",

The impact of such maternal information beyond embryonic development is largely unclear. Here we report that maternal contribution of histone H3.3 assembly complexes can prevent the expression of late-onset anatomical, physiologic, and behavioral abnormalities of C. elegans. We show that mutants lacking hira-1, an evolutionarily conserved H3.3-deposition factor, have severe pleiotropic defects that manifest predominantly at adulthood. These late-onset defects can be maternally rescued, and maternally derived HIRA-1 protein can be detected in hira-1(-/-) progeny. A screen for mutants that mimic the hira-1 mutant phenotype identified a HIRA complex component (PQN-80/UBN1) and a second H3.3 chaperone (XNP-1/ATRX). pqn-80 and xnp-1 abnormalities are also maternally rescued. Furthermore, mutants lacking histone H3.3 have late-onset defects similar to those of hira-1, pqn-80, and xnp-1 mutants. These data demonstrate that H3.3 assembly complexes provide non-DNA-based heritable information that can markedly influence adult phenotype. We speculate that similar maternal effects might explain the missing heritability of 2 late-onset human diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and type 2 diabetes.

Multipotent bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a promising cell source for autologous transplantation in many human diseases. To better realize their in vivo therapeutic potential, hypoxia preconditioning has become a novel strategy to improve the survival, migration, and angiogenic capability of MSCs. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of hypoxia preconditioning on MSCs, we respectively used standard expression microarray and exon microarray to investigate the global profiling of gene expression and alternative splicing in hypoxia preconditioned-MSCs, and the detection sensitivity of differential gene expression using exon microarray and standard expression microarray was compared. A total of 414 genes were identified as significantly differentially expressed using standard expression microarray, while only 72 genes were identified as significantly differentially expressed using exon microarray, suggesting that standard expression microarray should be preferred if exclusively to detect changes in gene level. Our finding generated a global profiling of gene expression and alternative splicing which may be responsible for enhanced therapeutic effect of the hypoxia preconditioned-hMSCs. Our work provides a general framework for the systematic study of stem cell biology under clinically relevant pathophysiologic conditions.

The small molecule ONC201 is toxic in vitro to multiple cell lines and primary tumor samples of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and acute myeloid leukemia, even ones with unfavorable genetic features (notably including TP53 inactivation) or acquired resistance to other agents. Because the mechanism of action in these malignant hematologic cells appeared to differ from that in solid tumors, we performed gene expression profiling (GEP) studies on MCL lines treated with ONC201 and other agents with known mechanisms of action. Treatment of JeKo-1 cells with 5 uM ONC201 showed consistent and progressive increases or decreases over time in two sets of genes: upregulated genes, which implicated an ER stress response and mTOR pathway inhibition, and downregulated genes, which implicated reduced proliferation. These implicated effects of ONC201 were validated by confirmatory experiments. Similar GEP changes were observed in ONC201-naive Z138 cells after 24 hr of ONC201 treatment, but were not seen in Z138 cells made ONC201-resistant by chronic exposure. Finally, the GEP effects of ONC201 in JeKo-1 cells were mimicked by the ER stress inducer tunicamycin, but not by the direct MTOR inhibition rapamycin, further confirming an ER stress response and suggesting that inhibition of the mTOR pathway was by an indirect mechanism. For each experiment, cells from a single stock culture of each cell line used were aliquoted into individual culture plate wells, establishing individual replicates, and drugs were added to start the experiment.

Concomitantly, HSC self-renewal is immensely augmented in absence of either Dnmt3, particularly Dnmt3a. Dnmt3-KO HSCs show upregulation of HSC multipotency genes and downregulation of early differentiation factors, and the differentiated progeny of Dnmt3-KO HSCs exhibit hypomethylation and incomplete repression of HSC-specific genes. HSCs lacking Dnmt3a manifest hyper-methylation of CpG islands and hypo-methylation of genes which are highly correlated with human hematologic malignancies.

Tafazzin-deficiency does not affect posttranslational HIF-1a regulation but rather HIF-1a gene-expression, a dysfunction recapitulated in iPSCs-derived cardiomyocytes from Barth Syndrome patients with Tafazzin-deficiency.

In hypoxia, Tafazzin-deficient cells display reduced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) perturbing NF-kB activation and concomitantly HIF-1a gene-expression. In agreement, Tafazzin-deficient mice hearts display reduced HIF-1a levels and undergo maladaptive hypertrophy with heart failure in response to pressure overload challenge. We conclude that defective mitochondrial cardiolipin-remodeling dampens HIF-1a signaling through inactivation of a non-canonical signaling pathway: Lack of NF-kB activation through reduced mitochondrial ROS production diminishes HIF-1a transcription.

Rationale:Increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM).Objectives:To investigate how TSC1 or TSC2 deficiency alters MMP expression and regulation.Methods:We studied immortalized cells that lack TSC2 derived from an angiomyolipoma (AML) of a LAM patient, and a TSC2 add back derivative; and murine embryonic fibroblast cells that lack Tsc1 or Tsc2 and respective controls. Global gene expression analysis was carried out in the AML and derivative cell lines. MMP levels in the conditioned media from these cells were analyzed by zymography and ELISA.Measurements and Main Results:We found increased MMP-2 expression in cells lacking TSC1/TSC2 compared to their respective controls by zymography. MMP-2 overproduction by these cells was not affected by rapamycin treatment. Gene expression analysis confirmed increased MMP-2 gene expression that was not affected by rapamycin. Furthermore, multiple other genes were found to be over-expressed in rapamycin-treated TSC2-deficient cells compared to TSC2+ cells.Conclusions:We conclude that TSC1/TSC2 deficiency leads to MMP-2 overproduction that is rapamycin insensitive, and that several genes exhibit similar patterns suggesting TSC1/TSC2 dependent but mTOR independent pathways may be involved in the pathogenesis of LAM. We studied immortalized cells that lack TSC2 derived from an angiomyolipoma (AML) of a LAM patient, and a TSC2 add back derivative.

    "text": "Conjugated linoleic acid suppresses FAS and promotes mammary tumorigenesis in PyV-MT mice. Overexpression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) has been reported in both malignant and premalignant breast lesions, and has been associated with poor outcome. FAS has gained interest as a metabolic target for the treatment of breast cancer based on evidence that blockade with the antifungal antibiotic, cerulenin or synthetic inhibitor C75 inhibits proliferation of breast cancer cells and delays tumor development. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a class of fatty acids found in beef and dairy products, has been shown to inhibit FAS in bovine mammary adipose. Based on previously well-documented anti-tumor activity of CLA, we hypothesized that one mechanism of CLA's anti-tumorigenic activity may be metabolic blockade of FAS. We fed virgin PyV-MT transgenic mice a diet supplemented with either 1% CLA, as mixed isomers, or control chow for four weeks. Tissue histology was determined by H&E staining. cDNA microarray and real-time quantitative PCR were performed to determine relative expression of lipogenic genes. Western blots were used to examine relative protein expression of FAS. Differences in protein densitometry were analyzed using Students 2-sided T-test. Probability was determined using the binomial sign test. Level of significance for all tests was 0.05. H&E staining revealed a shift towards advanced mammary lesions in the CLA-fed mice compared to control animals (24/26 vs. 11/26) (p for trend < 0.001). Microarray analysis revealed a >2-fold decrease in FAS in the CLA-fed group compared to controls, and was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (p < 0.001) and Western blot. The decrease in FAS mRNA expression was unexpectedly associated with more advanced disease (p for trend < 0.01). Conclusions: Dietary CLA suppressed fatty acid synthase in the mammary glands of the PyV-MT mouse while promoting mammary tumor progression.Keywords: dietary intervention to compare mammary tumorigenesis between groups. PyV-MT and wild type FVB mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bay Harbor, ME) and housed 2-4 per cage in micro insulator rooms. Mice were genotyped according to Jackson Laboratory protocols (http://jaxmice.jax.org/pub-cgi/protocols/protocols). PyV-MT positive females were randomly selected at four weeks of age to receive either a control AIN93G chow (n=5) or 1% CLA-supplemented chow (n=6). . Food disappearance and animal weights were recorded weekly. Animals were palpated three times a week, and tumor area (length x width) was measured by caliper. Only palpable masses with an area >/= 0.5 cm2 were considered established growths. Animals were euthanized by CO2 inhalation. Eight-week-old animals were selected for tissue histology and analysis of mRNA and protein expression. Mammary gland sections were collected and processed to obtain mRNA or protein lysate, paraffin embedded for histology, or stored in liquid nitrogen until further processing. .",

Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide with increasing incidence, the presence of metastasis is one of the major causes for poor outcome. BEX2 has been reported to be involved in tumor development in several types of cancer, but is poorly understood in metastatic colorectal cancer. Here we demonstrated that knockout of BEX2 resulted in the enhancement of the migratory and metastatic potential of colorectal cancer cells in vivo and in vitro, re-expression of BEX2 in knockout cells could reverse the migratory enhancement. Expression profile chip indicated that hedgehog signaling pathway was activated after knockout of BEX2, and hedgehog Signaling inhibitor GANT61 and GDC-0449 could somehow reverse the migratory enhancement of BEX2-/- colorectal cancer cells. We also demonstrated that it is the nucleus translocation of Zic2 after BEX2 silenced, that activated hedgehog signaling pathway, while knockdown Zic2 could also abrogated migratory enhancement of BEX2-/- cells. In summary, our findings suggest that BEX2 is a negative modulator of hedgehog signaling pathway by retaining Zic2 in the cytoplasm of colorectal cancer cells, thus to inhibit colorectal cancer cell migration and metastasis. mRNA profiles of colorectal cancer cell DLD1 (WT) and BEX2 knocked out DLD1 cells (DLD1 KO1 and DLD1 KO2) were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina Hiseq 3000.",

Small molecule inhibitors of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of proteins are in clinical trials for a variety of cancers, but patient selection strategies are limited. This is due in part to the heterogeneity of response following BET inhibition (BETi), which includes differentiation, senescence, and cell death in subsets of cancer cell lines. To elucidate the dominant features defining response to BETi, we carried out phenotypic and gene expression analysis of both treatment naive cell lines and engineered tolerant lines. We found that both de novo and acquired tolerance to BET inhibition are driven by the robustness of the apoptotic response and that genetic or pharmacological manipulation of the apoptotic signaling network can modify the phenotypic response to BETi. We further identify that ordered expression of the apoptotic genes BCL2, BCL2L1, and BAD significantly predicts response to BETi. Our findings highlight the role of the apoptotic network in response to BETi, providing a molecular basis for patient stratification and combination therapies.

Accordingly, mPINC expression is significantly decreased when HC11 mammary epithelial cells are induced to differentiate and produce milk proteins.

Natural killer (NK) cells belong to the innate immune system where they can control virus infections and developing tumors by cytotoxicity and production of inflammatory cytokines. Most studies of mouse NK cells, however, have focused on conventional NK (cNK) cells found in the spleen. Recently, we described two populations of NK cells within the liver, tissue-resident NK (trNK) cells and those resembling splenic cNK cells. However, the lineage relationship of trNK to cNK cells was unclear because trNK cells display a phenotype associated with immature, developing cNK cells. Moreover, liver trNK cells could be related to thymic NK cells or alternatively, a lineage distinct from both cNK and thymic NK cells. Herein we used detailed transcriptomic, flow cytometric, and functional analysis of mice deficient in several transcription factors to determine that liver trNK cells form a distinct lineage from cNK and thymic NK cells, especially because they do not require NFIL3 (E4BP4), the previously described NK cellspecification factor. Analysis of other tissues indicate the presence of trNK cells in skin and uterus with different transcription factor requirements. Thus, there are at least four distinct lineages of NK cells: cNK, thymic, liver (and skin) trNK, and uterine trNK cells. Liver NK 1.1+CD49+, liver NK 1.1+CD49-, spleen NK 1.1+ CD49- populations of NK cells were sorted with FACS pooling cells from individual mice to end up with ~100k cells for each samples. mRNA was derived from lysates using Invitrogen oligo-dT beads.",

Post-translational regulation of the MYC Transcription Factor (TF), including its phosphorylation and ubiquitination, plays an important role in determining cell proliferation and apoptosis and has been implicated in tumorigenesis.

Specifically, we show that in human B lymphoma ST486 cells STK38 is a key mediator of BCR pathway signaling, affecting MYC protein turnover and its phosphorylation at Ser62 in kinase-activity-dependent manner. STK38 inactivation abrogates apoptosis following BCR activation while its silencing mediates MYC protein degradation via canonical proteolytic pathways.

Neuroblastoma is a pediatric cancer characterized by variable outcomes ranging from spontaneous regression to life-threatening progression. High-risk neuroblastoma patients receive myeloablative chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem-cell transplant followed by adjuvant retinoid differentiation treatment. However, the overall survival remains low; hence, there is an urgent need for alternative therapeutic approaches. One feature of high-risk neuroblastoma is the high level of DNA methylation of putative tumor suppressors. Combining the reversibility of DNA methylation with the differentiation-promoting activity of retinoic acid (RA) could provide an alternative strategy to treat high-risk neuroblastoma. Here we show that treatment with the DNA demethylating drug 5-Aza-deoxycytidine (AZA) restores high-risk neuroblastoma sensitivity to RA. Combined systemic distribution of AZA and RA impedes tumor growth and prolongs survival. Genomewide analysis of treated tumors reveals that this combined treatment rapidly induces a HIF2a-associated hypoxia-like transcriptional response followed by an increase in neuronal gene expression and a decrease in cell-cycle gene expression. A small-molecule inhibitor of HIF2a activity diminishes the tumor response to AZA+RA treatment, indicating that the increase in HIF2a levels is a key component in tumor response to AZA+RA. The link between increased HIF2a levels and inhibited tumor growth is reflected in large neuroblastoma patient datasets. Therein, high levels of HIF2a, but not HIF1a, significantly correlate with expression of neuronal differentiation genes and better prognosis but negatively correlate with key features of high-risk tumors, such as MYCN amplification. Thus, contrary to previous studies, our findings indicate an unanticipated tumor-suppressive role for HIF2a in neuroblastoma. 68 samples, 3-5 samples per group, 4st treatment molecules; Ctrl (DMSO), Retinoic acid (RA), 5-Aza-deoxycytidine (AZA) and RA+AZA. 2E6 cells were injected, treatment start day 8 and tumors were collected at end point (EP; 1000 m3), day 10 or day 14.",

BackgroundIdentification of patients at risk of tuberculosis relapse following treatment would revolutionize clinical trials of new drugs and regimens and facilitate clinical management. The study aim was to determine whether tuberculosis patients who subsequently suffer relapse have different immune responses to mycobacteria in vitro compared to patients who remain cured for two years post-treatment.MethodsFirst episode pulmonary tuberculosis patients were recruited into a surrogate marker study in Cape Town, South Africa. Peripheral blood samples were collected at diagnosis and after two and four weeks of tuberculosis treatment. Diluted blood was cultured with live Mycobacterium tuberculosis for six days and cellular RNA was frozen. Gene expression in samples from ten patients who subsequently relapsed, confirmed by stain genotyping, was compared to those who remained cured using Affymetrix microarrays.ResultsAt diagnosis, the expression of 668 genes was significantly different in samples from patients who subsequently relapsed compared to successfully cured patients, and these differences persisted for at least four weeks. Gene Ontology and biological pathways analyses revealed the most significant difference was up-regulation of genes involved in cytotoxic cell-mediated killing, such as perforin, granulysin and fas ligand. Results were confirmed by qRT-PCR in a wider patient cohort.ConclusionsThese data show that patients who will subsequently relapse exhibit altered immune responses at diagnosis, including excessively robust cytolytic responses to M. tuberculosis in vitro, compared to patients who will achieve durable cure.

The influenza virus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet, the impact of intracellular viral invasion and the cellular response diversity remain uncharacterized. By massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq we comprehensively mapped the host lung response to in-vivo influenza infection in wild-type and Irf7-knockout mice across nine immune and non-immune cell types. We found an unexpected high prevalence of infected cells in all cell types, showed that infection is a characteristic property of cell types that is independent of type-I interferon activity, and demonstrated that all cell types responded primarily with a robust generic transcriptional response. Analysis of the viral and host transcriptomes in the same single cell enabled us to resolve the heterogeneity of bystander (exposed but uninfected) as compared to viral-infected cells. Our results highlight novel markers specific for influenza-infected as opposed to bystander cells, opening new avenues for targeted therapy aimed exclusively at infected cells. We used Massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq (MARS-seq) to characterize single cell RNA-seq of immune (CD45+) and non-immune (CD45-) cells derived from the lungs of influenza-treated and PBS-treated mice.",

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) classified as FAB-M0 is defined as a subtype with minimally differentiated morphology. Here we investigated by gene expression (GEP) profiling whether AML-M0 cases should be considered as one or more unique molecular subgroups that discriminates them from other AML patients. By applying GEP and subsequent unsupervised analysis of 35 AML-M0 samples and 253 previously reported AML cases, we demonstrate that AML-M0 cases express a unique signature. Hematological transcription regulators such as CEBPA, CEBPD, PU.1 and ETV6 and the differentiation associated gene MPO appeared strongly down-regulated, in line with the very primitive state of this type of leukemia. Moreover, AML M0 cases appeared to have a strong positive correlation with a previously defined immature AML subgroup with adverse prognosis. AML-M0 leukemias frequently carry loss-of-function RUNX-1 mutation and unsupervised analyses revealed a striking distinction between cases with and without mutations. RUNX1 mutant AML-M0 samples showed a distinct up-regulation of B-cell-related genes, e.g. members of the B-cell receptor complex, transcriptions regulators RUNX3, ETS2, IRF8 or PRDM1 and major histocompatibility complex class II genes. Importantly, expression of one single gene, i.e. BLNK, enabled prediction of RUNX1 mutations in AML-M0 with high accuracy. We propose that RUNX1 mutations in this subgroup of AML cause lineage infidelity, leading to aberrant co-expression of myeloid and B-lymphoid genes in the same cells. 35 samples.",

Changes in the genetic architecture during the development of benign and malignant tumours have not been investigated. Here, we document major changes in germline control of gene expression during skin tumour development as a consequence of cell selection, somatic genetic events, and changes in tumour microenvironment. Immune response genes such as Interleukin 18 and Granzyme E are under germline control in tumours but not in normal skin.

    "text": "The Osteoblast to Osteocyte Transition: Epigenetic Changes and Response to the Vitamin D3 Hormone [RNA-seq]. Osteocytes are derived from osteoblast lineage cells that become progressively embedded in mineralized bone. Development of the osteocytogenic cell line IDG-SW3 has enabled a temporal and mechanistic investigation of this process. Through RNA-seq analyses, we show that while substantial changes in gene expression occur during the osteoblast to osteocyte transition, the majority of the transcriptome remains qualitatively osteoblast-like. Genes either up-regulated or expressed uniquely in the osteocyte include local and systemic factors such as Sost and Fgf23 as well as genes implicated in neuronal, muscle, vascular, or regulatory function. As assessed by ChIP-seq, numerous changes in epigenetic histone modifications also occur during osteocytogenesis; these are largely qualitative rather than quantitative. Specific epigenetic changes correlate with altered gene expression patterns that are observed during the transition. These genomic changes likely influence the highly restricted transcriptomic response to 1,25(OH)2D3 that occurs during differentiation. VDR binding in osteocytes revealed an extensive cistrome co-occupied by RXR and located predominantly at sites distal to regulated genes. Although sites of VDR binding were apparent near many 1,25(OH)2D3-regulated genes, the expression of others adjacent to VDR binding sites were unaffected; lack of VDR binding was particularly prevalent at down-regulated genes. Interestingly, 1,25(OH)2D3 was found to induce the Boc and Cdon co-receptors that are active in hedgehog signaling in osteocytes. We conclude that osteocytogenesis is accompanied by changes in gene expression that may be driven by both genetic and epigenetic components. These changes are likely responsible for the osteocyte phenotype and may contribute to reduced sensitivity to 1,25(OH)2D3. Two sets of IDG-SW3 differentitiation mRNA-seq experiments are presented here in biological triplicate. One a differentiation time course in the basal condition at days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35.

Expression profiling of androgen and insulin pathway regulating genes unveils SOS 1 as candidate gene for idiopathic hirsutismBackground: Idiopathic Hirsutism (IH), defined as the presence of terminal hairs in females in a male-like pattern, affecting about 5% -15% of women, may result from the interaction between the androgen level and the sensitivity of the hair follicle to the androgen. The pathophysiology of IH is presumed to be linked to increased SRD5A activity, probably both isoenzyme types (SRD5A1 and SRD5A2) and generally related to an alteration in androgen receptor (AR) function. IH is often associated to metabolic syndrome, visceral obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and hypertension.Methodology/Principal Findings: With the aim of identifying genes involved in the pathogenesis of this disorder, we investigated the expression profile of 190 genes involved in the androgen biosynthesis and metabolism, and other genes coding for products active in the insulin pathway in skin genital fibroblasts. For this purpose we selected from a cohort of 240 women affected with androgen excess syndrome a group of 52 idiopathic hirsute patients (22%) and we selected 8 of them with the higher grade of hirsutism (Ferriman & Gallway score >20) for the genetic studies comparing the data with 4 healthy women used as controls. The array gene signature in the IH patients identified 4 differentially expressed genes, 2 up-regulated and 2 down-regulated (FC>=+- 1.5). Differentially expressed genes included products involved in insulin signalling while no androgens related genes were found altered in expression levels. We found that one of the over expressed transcript codes for the SOS1 gene product, which is overproduced in IH patients compared to controls. We did not identified any genomic variants or SNPs in the SOS1 promoter region and/or witin the 3'UTR with documented functional effects on SOS1 gene expression, although some variants in the 3'UTR seems to be potentially active in modulating the binding of transcription factors.Conclusions/Significance: In the cohort of women with androgen excess syndrome studied the 22% had neither hyperandrogenemia nor biochemical sign of hyperinsulinemia. We were able to demonstrate that SOS1 mRNA is over-expressed resulting in over production of SOS1 protein in IH patients. This suggests that an increase of SOS1 protein production could reflect a situation with an increased SOS1 activity function in hirsute patients. These findings propose a role for SOS1, in cooperation with other insulin pathway genes, in the pathogenesis of IH. We used the microarray technology to study the expression profiles of 190 genes involved in the androgen biosynthesis and metabolism, and other genes coding for products active in the insulin pathway, in genital skin fibroblasts of 8 idiopathic hirsute women and 4 related controls. To reduce individual variation and other confounding events, such as spontaneous up- and down-regulation of genes, the patients and the controls were pooled into 2 distinct pools. The gene expression analysis have been just used to identify genes which expression profiles result alterated and which could represents new genes involved in the pathogenesis of hirsutism.",

Acinar cells make up the majority of all cells in the pancreas, yet the source of new acinar cells during homeostasis remains unknown. Using multicolor lineage-tracing and organoid-formation assays, we identified the presence of a progenitor-like acinar cell subpopulation. These cells have long-term self-renewal capacity, albeit in a unipotent fashion. We further demonstrate that binuclear acinar cells are terminally differentiated acinar cells. Transcriptome analysis of single acinar cells revealed the existence of a minor population of cells expressing progenitor markers. Interestingly, a gain of the identified markers accompanied by a transient gain of proliferation was observed following chemically induced pancreatitis. Altogether, our study identifies a functionally and molecularly distinct acinar subpopulation and thus transforms our understanding of the acinar cell compartment as a pool of equipotent secretory cells. The single-cell RNA-seq library preparation protocol was based on the SMART seq2 protocol (Picelli et al., 2014) with following modifications.Acinar cells were isolated as described in the section Acinar Cell Isolation and Culture and resuspended in DPBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PAN-Biotech).

    "text": "New anti-cancer chemicals Ertredin and its derivatives, regulate oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis and suppress sphere formation in vitro and tumor growth in EGFRvIII-transformed cells. Background: EGFRvIII is a mutant form of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) that lacks exons 2-7. The resulting protein does not bind to ligands and is constitutively activated. The expression of EGFRvIII is likely confined to various types of cancer, particularly glioblastomas. Although an anti-EGFRvIII vaccine is of great interest, low-molecular-weight substances are needed to obtain better therapeutic efficacy. Thus, the purpose of this study is to identify low molecular weight substances that can suppress EGFRvIII-dependent transformation.Methods: We constructed a new throughput screening system and searched for substances that decreased cell survival of NIH3T3/EGFRvIII spheres under 3-dimensional (3D)-culture conditions, but retained normal NIH3T3 cell growth under 2D-culture conditions. In vivo activity was examined using a mouse transplantation model, and derivatives were chemically synthesized. Functional characterization of the candidate molecules was investigated using an EGFR kinase assay, immunoprecipitation, western blotting, microarray analysis,quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, and measurement of lactate and ATP synthesis.Results: In the course of screening 30,000 substances, a reagent, \"Ertredin,\" was found to inhibit anchorage-independent 3D growth of sphere-forming cells transfected withEGFRvIII cDNA. Ertredin also inhibited sphere formation in cells expressing wild-type EGFR in the presence of EGF. However, it did not affect anchorage-dependent 2D growth of parental NIH3T3 cells. The 3D-growth-inhibitory activity of some derivatives, including those with new structures, was similar to Ertredin. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Ertredin suppressed tumor growth in an allograft transplantation mouse model injected with EGFRvIII- or wild-type EGFR-expressing cells; a clear toxicity to host animals was not observed. Functional characterization of Ertredin in cells expressing EGFRvIII indicated that it stimulated EGFRvIII ubiquitination, suppressed both oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis under 3D conditions, and promoted cell apoptosis.Conclusion: We developed a high throughput screening method based on anchorage-independent sphere formation induced by EGFRvIII-dependent transformation. In the course of screening, we identified Ertredin, which inhibited anchorage-independent 3D growth and tumor formation in nude mice. Functional analysis suggests that Ertredin suppresses both mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and cytosolic glycolysis in addition to promoting EGFRvIII degradation, and stimulates apoptosis in sphere-forming, EGFRvIII-overexpressing cells. Patterns of gene expression in cells treated with Ertredin (sample 2), rotenone (sample 3), and AG1478 (sample 4) were compared with vehicle-control cells (sample 1).",

    "text": "Lamin A/C Is Required For ChAT-Dependent Neuroblastoma Differentiation: a microarray gene expression study. The mouse neuroblastoma N18TG2 clone is unable to differentiate and defective for the enzymes of the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters. The forced expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in these cells results in the synthesis and release of acetylcholine (Ach) and hence in the expression of neurospecific features and markers. To understand how the expression of ChAT triggered neuronal differentiation, we studied the differences in genome-wide transcription profiles between the N18TG2 parental cells and its ChAT-expressing 2/4 derived clone. The engagement of the 2/4 cells in the neuronal developmental programme was confirmed by the increase of the expression level of several differentiation-related genes and by the reduction of the amount of transcripts of cell-cycle genes. At the same time, we observed a massive reorganisation of cytoskeletal proteins in terms of gene expression, with the accumulation of the nucleoskeletal lamina component Lamin A/C in differentiating cells. The increase of the Lmna transcripts induced by ChAT-espression in 2/4 cells was mimicked treating the parental N18TG2 cells with the acetylcholine-receptor agonist carbachol, thus demonstrating the direct role played by this receptor in neuron nuclei maturation. Conversely, a treatment of 2/4 cells with the muscarinic-receptor antagonist atropine resulted in the reduction of the amount of Lmna RNA. Finally, the hypothesis that Lmna gene product might play a crucial role in the ChAT-dependent molecular differentiation cascade was strongly supported by Lmna knock-down in 2/4 cells leading to the down-regulation of genes involved in differentiation and cytoskeleton formation and to the up-regulation of genes known to regulate self-renewal and stemness. The gene expression profile of the ChAT-expressing 2/4 clone was compared to that of the N18TG2 parental cells, with and without retinoic acid (RA) stimulation using Agilent microarray analysis.",

Down syndrome (DS) is the most frequent cause of human congenital mental retardation. Cognitive deficits in DS result from perturbations of normal cellular processes both during development and in adult tissues, but the mechanisms underlying DS etiology remain poorly understood. To assess the ability of iPSCs to model DS phenotypes, as a prototypical complex human disease, we generated bona-fide DS and wild-type (WT) non-viral iPSCs by episomal reprogramming. DS iPSCs selectively overexpressed chromosome 21 genes, consistent with gene dosage, which was associated with deregulation of thousands of genes throughout the genome. DS and WT iPSCs were neurally converted at >95% efficiency, and had remarkably similar lineage potency, differentiation kinetics, proliferation and axon extension at early time points. However, at later time points DS cultures showed a two-fold bias towards glial lineages.Moreover, DS neural cultures were up to two times more sensitive to oxidative stress induced apoptosis, and this could be prevented by the anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine. Our results reveal a striking complexity in the genetic alterations caused by trisomy-21 that are likely to underlie DS developmental phenotypes, and indicate a central role for defective early glial development in establishing developmental defects in DS brains. Furthermore, oxidative stress sensitivity is likely to contribute to the accelerated neurodegeneration seen in DS, and we provide proof of concept for screening corrective therapeutics using DS iPSCs and their derivatives. Non-viral DS iPSCs can therefore recapitulate features of complex human disease in vitro, and provide a renewable and ethically unencumbered discovery platform. Control (WT) and Down Syndrome iPSC lines were generated via episomal reprogramming of human donor fibroblasts. Two iPSC clones conforming to iPS criteria (determined by immunocytochemistry detection of pluripotency markers) were developed from each fibroblast donor. Two control (WT) and DS lines each were further characterized and underwent neural differentiation. Multiple biological replicates of donor fibroblast and iPSC from both control (WT) and DS lines, including 3 euploid DS samples and 3 MEL1 hESC controls (total 54 samples) were hybridized to Illumina HT-12 v4 microarray for gene expression analysis.",

Extracellular circulating miRNAs are both candidate biomarkers for disease pathogenesis and mediators of cell-to-cell communication. We examined the miRNA expression profile of total serum and serum derived exosome-enriched extracellular vesicles in people with normal glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes. In contrast to total serum miRNA, which did not reveal any differences in miRNA expression, we identified differentially abundant miRNAs in type 2 diabetes patients using miRNA expression profiles of exosome RNA (exoRNA). To validate the role of these differentially abundant miRNAs on glucose metabolism, we transfected miR-20b-5p, a highly abundant exoRNA in type 2 diabetic patients, into primary human skeletal muscle cells. miR-20b-5p overexpression increased basal glycogen synthesis in human skeletal muscle cells. We identified AKTIP and STAT3 as miR-20b-5p targets. miR-20b-5p overexpression reduced AKTIP abundance and insulin-stimulated glycogen accumulation. In conclusion, exosome derived extracellular miR-20b-5p is a circulating biomarker associated with type 2 diabetes, which plays an intracellular role in modulating insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism via AKT signaling.

However, it is unclear how aging interacts with genetic predispositions to promote neurodegeneration. Here we investigate how partial loss-of-function of TBK1, a major genetic cause for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) comorbidity, leads to age-dependent neurodegeneration. We show that TBK1 is an endogenous inhibitor of RIPK1 and the embryonic lethality of Tbk1-/- mice is dependent on RIPK1 kinase activity. In aging human brains, another endogenous RIPK1 inhibitor, TAK1, exhibits a marked decrease in expression. We show that in Tbk1+/- mice, the reduced myeloid TAK1 expression promotes all the key hallmarks of ALS/FTD, including neuroinflammation, TDP-43 aggregation, axonal degeneration, neuronal loss and behavior deficits, which are blocked upon inhibition of RIPK1. Thus, aging facilitates RIPK1 activation by reducing TAK1 expression, which cooperates with genetic risk factors to promote the onset of ALS/FTD. mRNA profiles of primary microglia derived from 2-day old wild type (WT), Tbk1+/-, Tbk1+/-;Ripk1D138N/D138N, Tak1DM/+, Tbk1+/-;Tak1DM/+ and Tbk1+/-;Tak1DM/+;RIpk1D138N/+ mice were generated by bulk RNA sequencing, in triplicate.",

Despite mounting evidence in support of ovarian CSCs, their phenotype and clinical relevance remain unclear. We and others have found high aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDHhigh) expression in a variety of normal and malignant stem cells, and sought to better characterize ALDHhigh cells in ovarian cancer.Methods: We compared ALDHhigh to ALDHlow cells in two ovarian cancer models representing distinct subtypes: FNAR-C1 cells, derived from a spontaneous rat endometrioid carcinoma, and the human SKOV3 cell line (described as both serous and clear cell subtypes). We assessed these populations for stem cell features then analyzed expression by microarray and qPCR.Results: ALDHhigh cells displayed CSC properties, including: smaller size, quiescence, regenerating the phenotypic diversity of the cell lines in vitro, lack of contact inhibition, nonadherent growth, multi-drug resistance, and in vivo tumorigenicity. Microarray and qPCR analysis of the expression of markers reported by others to enrich for ovarian CSCs revealed that ALDHhigh cells of both models showed downregulation of CD24, but inconsistent expression of CD44, KIT and CD133. However, the following drugable targets were consistently expressed in the ALDHhigh cells from both models: mTOR signaling, her-2/neu, CD47 and FGF18 / FGFR3.Conclusions: Based on functional characterization, ALDHhigh ovarian cancer cells represent an ovarian CSC population.

The relationship between stochastic transcriptional bursts and dynamic 3D chromatin states is not well understood due to poor sensitivity and/or resolution of current chromatin structure-based assays. Consequently, it is not well established if enhancers operate individually and/or in clusters to coordinate gene transcription. In the current study, we introduce Nodewalk, which uniquely combines high sensitivity with high resolution to enable the analysis of chromatin networks in minute input material. The >10,000-fold increase in sensitivity over other many-to-all competing methods uncovered that active chromatin hubs identified in large input material, corresponding to 10 000 cells, flanking the MYC locus are primarily virtual. Thus, the close agreement between chromatin interactomes generated from aliquots corresponding to less than 10 cells with randomly re-sampled interactomes, we find that numerous distal enhancers positioned within flanking topologically associating domains (TADs) converge on MYC in largely mutually exclusive manners. Moreover, when comparing with several enhancer baits, the assignment of the MYC locus as the node with the highest dynamic importance index, indicates that it is MYC targeting its enhancers, rather than vice versa. Dynamic changes in the configuration of the boundary between TADs flanking MYC underlie numerous stochastic encounters with a diverse set of enhancers to depict the plasticity of its transcriptional regulation. Such an arrangement might increase the fitness of the cancer cell by increasing the probability of MYC transcription in response to a wide range of environmental cues encountered by the cell during the neoplastic process.

NLRP6 was previously demonstrated to regulate the production of IL-18 and is important for protecting mice against chemically-induced intestinal injury and colitis-associated colon cancer. However, the cellular mechanisms by which NLRP6 reduces susceptibility to colonic inflammation remain unclear.

Adoptive transfer of WT Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes into Nlrp6-/- mice was sufficient to protect them from mortality, significantly reducing intestinal permeability and damage. NLRP6-deficient inflammatory monocytes were specifically defective in TNFa production, which was important for reducing DSS-induced mortality and dependent on autocrine IL-18 signaling by inflammatory monocytes. Our data reveal a previously unappreciated role for NLRP6 in inflammatory monocytes, which are recruited during intestinal injury to promote barrier function and limit bacteria-driven inflammation.

Given that aging is the major determinant of cancer incidence, and that cancer incidence is dictated in large part by processes modulating progression of existing subclinical cancers, we demonstrate that aging may be an organizing axis for identifying cancer progression-modulating processes. This would permit the broad understanding of the aging process to directly inform the question of what changes in aggregate host signaling favor cancer progression. Exploring this idea, a syngeneic murine Lewis lung cancer model in adolescent (68 days), young adult (143 days), middle-aged (551 days), and old (736 days) C57BL/6 mice was used to identify the signaling and functional processes varying significantly with host age. As anticipated, many of these specific endpoints proved to be major determinants of cancer progression. Older hosts demonstrated decreased angiogenesis, decreased metabolism and dysregulated apoptosis, all identified as hallmarks of cancer progression. Transforming growth factor 1, downregulated in older hosts, was also identified as a central player in these systemic processes. It is concluded that the strong host-age dependence here observed for tumor advancement facilitates the identification of an overarching tumor control dynamic exerted by the host. Revealed is insight into a mechanistic basis for the role of aging on modulation of tumor progression that may be therapeutically exploitable.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are believed to be driven by dysregulated interactions between the host and the gut microbiota. Our goal is to characterize the relationships between mucosal T cells, the host tissue environment and microbial communities in IBD patients to identify new therapeutic targets. We identified 26 predictors from our combined data set that were effective in distinguishing between regions of the intestine undergoing active inflammation and regions that were normal. Network analysis on these 26 predictors revealed SAA1 as the most connected node linking the abundance of the genus Bacteroides with the production of IL17 and IL22 by CD4+ T cells. The SAA1-linked microbial and transcriptome interactions were further validated with data from the pediatric IBD RISK cohort. This study identifies expression of SAA1 as an important link between mucosal T cells, microbial communities and their tissue environment in IBD patients. A combination of FACS, gene expression and microbial profiling can distinguish between intestinal inflammatory states in IBD regardless of disease types. We characterized mucosal CD4+ T cells using flow cytometry (FACS), along with matching mucosal global gene expression and microbial communities data from 35 pinch biopsy samples from IBD patients. We analyzed these data sets using an integrated framework to identify predictors of inflammatory states and then validated the putative relationship networks by analyzing data from the pediatric RISK cohort.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play important roles in gene regulation and their dysregulation is associated with many diseases. In this study, we determined the expression and function of miR-590-3p in EOC. We found that miR-590-3p levels were higher in high-grade carcinoma when compared to low-grade or tumours with low malignant potential. Interestingly, plasma levels of miR-590-3p were significantly higher in EOC patients than in subjects with benign gynaecological disorders. Transient transfection of miR-590-3p mimics, or stable transfection of mir-590, increased cell growth, migration, and invasion. In vivo studies revealed that mir-590 accelerated tumour growth and metastasis. Using a cDNA microarray, we identified Forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) and Versican (VCAN) as a top downregulated and a top upregulated gene, respectively, by mir-590. We showed that miR-590-3p targeted FOXA2 3' UTR to suppress its expression. In addition, knockdown of FOXA2 by siRNAs or knockout of FOXA2 by CRISPR/Cas9 enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Overexpression of FOXA2 decreased, while knockout of FOXA2 increased, VCAN mRNA and protein levels and ChIP-qPCR revealed that FOXA2 binds to VCAN promoter. Interrogation of the TCGA ovarian cancer database revealed a negative relationship between FOXA2 and VCAN mRNA levels in EOC tumours and that high FOXA2/low VCAN mRNA levels in tumours were positively correlated with patient survival. Finally, overexpression of FOXA2 or silencing of VCAN reversed the effects of mir-590. These findings demonstrate that miR-590-3p promotes EOC development via a novel FOXA2-VCAN pathway. A total of 6 samples were analyzed. Three control (EV) and three mir-590 overexpressing samples.",

TERT-Immortalized cell lines from the same sources were also generated.Abstract: Advanced age and DNA damage accumulation are strong risk factors for cancer. The premature-aging disorder Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) provides a unique opportunity to study the interplay between DNA damage and aging-associated tumor mechanisms, since HGPS patients do not develop tumors despite elevated levels of DNA damage. Here, we have used HGPS patient cells to identify a protective mechanism to oncogenesis. We find that HGPS cells are resistant to neo-plastic transformation. This resistance is mediated by the bromodomain protein BRD4, which exhibits altered genome-wide binding patterns in transformation-resistant cells leading to inhibition of oncogenic de-differentiation. BRD4 also in-hibits, albeit to a lower extent, the tumorigenic potential of transformed cells from healthy individuals and BRD4-mediated tumor protection is clinically relevant, since a BRD4 gene signature predicts positive clinical outcome in breast and lung cancer. Our results demonstrate a protective function for BRD4 and suggest tissue-specific functions for BRD4 in tumorigenesis. 2 independent cell lines are included for each of the 4 groups (TERT-WT, TRS-WT, TERT-HGPS and TRS-HGPS).",

Transcriptional deregulation of oncogenic pathways is a hallmark of cancer, and can be due to epigenetic alterations. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine is a recently discovered epigenetic modification that has not been studied in pancreatic cancer. Genome-wide analysis of 5-hmC enriched loci with hmC-seal was conducted in low-passage pancreatic cancer cell lines and primary patient-derived xenografts and revealed strikingly altered patterns in neoplastic tissues. Differentially hydroxymethylated regions preferentially affected regulatory regions of the genome, specifically overlapping with known H3K4me1 enhancers. Furthermore, base pair resolution analysis of methylation and hydroxymethylation with oxidative bisulfite sequencing was conducted and correlated with chromatin accessibility by ATAC-seq in pancreatic cancer and control samples. 5hmC was specifically enriched at open regions of chromatin and gain of 5-hmC was correlated with upregulation of the cognate transcripts, including many oncogenic pathways implicated in pancreatic neoplasia, such as myc, KRAS, VEGF and BRD4. Specifically, BRD4 was overexpressed and acquired 5hmC at enhancer regions in majority of neoplastic samples. Functionally, acquisition of 5hmC at BRD4 promoter regulated increase in transcript expression. Furthermore, blockade of BRD4 inhibited pancreatic cancer growth in vivo. In summary, redistribution of 5-hmC and preferential enrichment at oncogenic enhancers is a novel regulatory mechanism in human cancer.

    "text": "Dopaminergic subset specification as a model for molecular mechanisms of neural vulnerability in Parkinson's Disease. Mesodiencephalic dopaminergic (mdDA) neurons critically regulate locomotory behavior and emotion, and dysfunction is associated with psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's Disease (PD). A pathological hallmark of PD is the specific degeneration of Substantia Nigra (SN) neurons, whereas Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) neurons are relatively unaffected. Differential molecular programming of the developing SN versus VTA may underly this specific vulnerability, and indeed molecularly distinct mdDA subsets have been identified during development. Driven by the hypothesis that the molecular signature of the SN and VTA originates from differential developmental programming and position along the rostral/caudal axis, we performed genome-wide expression profiling of FACS-purified rostral versus caudal mdDA neurons. Here, we present the distinct transcriptomes of these mdDA subsets and demonstrate how, on a genome-wide scale: 1) transcription factor regulation relates to developmental position, 2) rostral and caudal mdDA neurons differ in their functional genome, 3) the molecular signature of rostral versus caudal mdDA neurons relates to the SN versus VTA molecular profile in adult mice and human and 4) human homologues of rostrally enriched genes are mostly downregulated in the SN of PD patients. Our analyses substantiate the relationship of developmental positions with the SN versus VTA distinction in adult, and suggest cross-species conservation of molecular programs. Driven by these observations, we present 69 target genes that are rostral enriched and downregulated in PD, and thus provide new leads for the investigation of both the complex coding of developing mdDA subsets and and the molecular mechanisms underlying subset-specific vulnerability in PD. Microarrray analysis was performed in quadruple. Each biological replicate consisted of a pool of Pitx3(Gfp/+) rostral or caudal samples from 5-7 individual embyros that were interleaved across litters to account for litter-to-litter variation, or a pool of Gfp-negative cells from the same specimens as a common reference.",

In wild-type mice, expression of chemokines that are ligands for Ccr2, Cxcr3, and Cxcr2 increased at days 32 to 41 post-infection, with a return to baseline by day 75. Concomitant increases were seen in Ccr2 and Cxcr3 but not in Cxcr2 expression.

Ccr2 and Cx3cr1 knockout mice cleared Pneumocystis infection with kinetics similar to wild-type mice, and all animals developed anti-Pneumocystis antibodies. Upregulation of Ccr2 and Cxcr3 and their ligands supports an important role for T helper cells and mononuclear phagocytes in the clearance of Pneumocystis infection.

Here we found that pDCs developed predominantly from IL7R+ lymphoid progenitor cells. Expression of SiglecH and Ly6D defined pDC lineage commitment along the lymphoid branch. Transcriptional characterization of SiglecH+Ly6D+ precursors indicated that pDC development requires high expression of the transcription factor IRF8, while pDC identity relies on TCF4. RNA sequencing of IL7R+ lymphoid and CDP-derived pDCs mirrored the heterogeneity of mature pDCs observed by single-cell analysis.

Background: Gene expression profiling has been used extensively within breast cancer research. Patient matched transcriptomic studies of tumour samples before and after treatment offer great potential and have been initiated, but tend not to include a control group. Here we examine gene expression changes between patient-matched core biopsies and surgical resection samples in the absence of treatment, to consider sampling methods and tumour heterogeneity. Patients and Methods: Illumina BeadArray technology was used to measure dynamic changes in gene expression from thirty-seven paired baseline and surgically excised breast tumour samples obtained from women receiving no treatment prior to surgery. Results: Patient-matched sample pairs had significantly higher correlations than samples between different individuals, demonstrating that tumour heterogeneity and intra-tumour differences are less prominent than inter-tumour/patient differences. Perhaps surprisingly, consistent changes in gene expression were identified during the diagnosis-surgery interval, despite a lack of treatment. 50 genes were significantly differentially expressed (48 up, 2 down; FDR 0.05) in a manner that appears independent of both subtype and the sampling-interval length. Gene set enrichment analysis using four independent treated datasets has implicated the tumour sampling method as the likely cause of these expression changes which include increases in early growth response genes such as EGR1, 2 and 3 along with DUSP1 and FOS. Our data does not support the idea that there is a significant wounding or immune response. Conclusion: This is the largest cohort of patient-matched transcriptome profiling of tumours from patients receiving no treatment between diagnosis and surgery to date. It has revealed that consistent changes in gene expression do exist between diagnostic core biopsy and the surgical excision sample. We have confirmed these findings in a number of published breast cancer datasets. Ultimately, researchers should be aware of the potential for the tumour sampling method to introduce a confounding factor in future neoadjuvant studies. 37 paired patient-matched whole-transcriptome profiled primary breast tumours from patients receiving no treatment between diagnosis and surgery.

Better understanding the progression of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the developing cerebral cortex is important for modeling neurogenesis and defining the pathogenesis of neuropsychiat-ric disorders. Here we used RNA-sequencing, cell imaging and lineage tracing of mouse and human in vitro NSCs to model the generation of cortical neuronal fates. We show that con-served signaling mechanisms regulate the acute transition from proliferative NSCs to commit-ted glutamatergic excitatory neurons. As human telencephalic NSCs developed from pluripo-tentcy in vitro, they first transitioned through organizer states that spatially pattern the cortex before generating glutamatergic precursor fates. NSCs derived from multiple human pluripotent lines varied in these early states leading differentially to dorsal or ventral telencephalic fates.

Nuclear receptor-binding SET domain protein 1 (NSD1) prototype is a family of mammalian histone methyltransferases (NSD1, NSD2/MMSET/WHSC1, NSD3/WHSC1L1) that are essential in development and are mutated in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), overgrowth syndromes, multiple myeloma and lung cancers. In AML, the recurring t(5;11)(q35;p15.5) translocation fuses NSD1 to nucleoporin-98 (NUP98). Here, we present the first characterization of the transforming properties and molecular mechanisms of NUP98-NSD1. We demonstrate that NUP98-NSD1 induces AML in vivo, sustains self-renewal of myeloid stem cells in vitro, and enforces expression of the HoxA7, HoxA9, HoxA10 and Meis1 proto-oncogenes. Mechanistically, NUP98-NSD1 binds genomic elements adjacent to HoxA7 and HoxA9, maintains histone H3 Lys 36 (H3K36) methylation and histone acetylation, and prevents EZH2-mediated transcriptional repression of the Hox-A locus during differentiation. Deletion of the NUP98 FG-repeat domain, or mutations in NSD1 that inactivate the H3K36 methyltransferase activity or that prevent binding of NUP98-NSD1 to the Hox-A locus precluded both Hox-A gene activation and myeloid progenitor immortalization. We propose that NUP98-NSD1 prevents EZH2-mediated repression of Hox-A locus genes by colocalizing H3K36 methylation and histone acetylation at regulatory DNA elements.

Piecemeal identification of many axonogenesis-related genes has been done, but coordinated regulation is unknown. Through unbiased transcriptome profiling of immature primary cortical neurons during early axon formation, we discovered an association between axonogenesis and neuron-specific alternative splicing. Known axonogenesis genes exhibit little expression alternation but widespread splicing changes. Axonogenesis-associated splicing is governed by RNA binding protein PTBP2, which is enriched in neurons and peaks around axonogenesis in the brain. Cortical depletion of PTBP2 prematurely induces axonogenesis-associated splicing, causes imbalanced expression of axonogenesis-associated isoforms, and specifically affects axon formation in vitro and in vivo. PTBP2-controlled axongeneisis-associated Shtn1 splicing determines SHTN1's capacity to regulate actin interaction, polymerization, and axon growth. Precocious Shtn1 isoform switch contributes to disorganized axon formation of Ptbp2-/- neurons. We conclude that PTBP2-orchestrated alternative splicing programming is required for robust generation of a single axon in mammals. Immature cortical neurons were cultured from embryonic day 14 mouse neocortices at the density of 1 million cells per 35 mm petri dish. At 1 day in vitro (1 DIV), these neurons extend multiple indistinguishable processes in a seemingly random manner, just like pre-axonogenesis neurons in vivo.

The cellular microRNA, miR-155 has been shown to be involved in lymphocyte activation and is expressed in EBV infected cells displaying type III latency gene expression but not type I latency gene expression. We show here that the elevated levels of miR-155 in type III latency cells is due to EBV gene expression and not epigenetic differences in cell lines tested and we show that expression in EBV infected cells requires a conserved AP-1 element in the miR-155 promoter. Gene expression analysis was carried out in a type I latency cell line transduced with a miR-155 expressing retrovirus. This analysis identified both miR-155 suppressed and induced cellular mRNAs and suggested that in addition to direct targeting of 3' UTRs, miR-155 alters gene expression in part through the alteration of signal transduction pathways. 3' UTR reporter analysis of predicted miR-155 target genes identified the transcriptional regulatory genes, BACH1, ZIC3, HIVEP2, CEBPB, ZNF652, ARID2, and SMAD5 as miR-155 targets. Western blot analysis of the most highly suppressed of these, BACH1, showed lower expression in cells transduced with a miR-155 retrovirus. Inspection of the promoters from genes regulated in EBV infected cells and in cells infected with a miR-155 retrovirus identified potential binding sequences for BACH1 and ZIC3.

Microglia play a pivotal role in the maintenance of brain homeostasis, but lose their homeostatic function during the course of neurodegenerative disorders. We identified a specific APOE-dependent molecular signature in microglia isolated from mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease (SOD1, EAE and APP-PS1) and in microglia surrounding neuritic A-plaques in human Alzheimer's disease brain. This is mediated by a switch from a (M0)-homeostatic to (MGnD)-neurodegenerative phenotype following phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons via the TREM2-APOE pathway. TREM2 induces APOE signaling which is a negative regulator of the transcription program in M0-homeostatic microglia. Targeting the TREM2-APOE pathway restores the M0-homeostatic signature of microglia in APP-PS1 and SOD1 mice and prevents from neuronal loss in an acute model of neurodegeneration. In SOD1 mice, TREM2 regulates MGnD in a gender-dependent manner. APOE-mediated MGnD microglia lose their tolerogenic function. Taken together, our work identifies the TREM2-APOE pathway as a major regulator of microglial functional phenotype in neurodegenerative diseases and serves as a novel target to restore homeostatic microglia.

    "text": "Combined use of astragalus polysaccharide and berberine attenuates insulin resistance in IR-HepG2 cells via regulation of the gluconeogenesis signaling pathway. Insulin resistance (IR) is likely to induce metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Gluconeogenesis (GNG) is a complex metabolic process that may result in glucose generation from certain non-carbohydrate substrates. Chinese herbal medicine astragalus polysaccharides and berberine have been documented to ameliorate IR, and combined use of astragalus polysaccharide (AP) and berberine (BBR) are reported to synergistically produce an even better effect. However, what change may occur in the GNG signaling pathway of IR-HepG2 cells in this synergistic effect and whether AP-BBR attenuates IR by regulating the GNG signaling pathway remain unclear. For the first time, we discovered in this study that the optimal time of IR-HepG2 cell model formation was 48 hours after insulin intervention. AP-BBR attenuated IR in HepG2 cells and the optimal concentration was 10mg. AP-BBR reduced the intracellular H2O2 content with no significant effect on apoptosis of IR-HepG2 cells. In addition, a rapid change was observed in intracellular calcium current of the IR-HepG2 cell model, and AP-BBR intervention attenuated this change markedly. The gene sequencing results showed that the GNG signaling pathway was one of the signaling pathways of AP-BBR to attenuate IR in IR-Hepg2 cells. The expression of p-FoxO1Ser256 and PEPCK protein was increased and the expression of GLUT2 protein was decreased significantly in the IR-HepG2 cell model, and both of these effects could be reversed by AP-BBR intervention. AP-BBR attenuated IR in IR-HepG2 cells, probably by regulating the GNG signaling Pathway. HepG2 cells (Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China) were cultured in 1640 medium (Hyclone, Beijing, China) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone, Beijing, China) and 1 x streptomycin in a 37 5% CO2 saturated humidity incubator. The normally cultured HepG2 cell lines in log phase were centrifuged at 100grpm for 5 min, and 20000 cells/well were placed in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37degC.The experiment was performed in 24-h control group, 24-h model group, 36-h control group, 36-h model group, 48-h control group, 48-h model group, 72-h control group and 72-h model group. Insulin (Gibco, NY, USA) was diluted to a final concentration of 10-6 mol/L in complete medium. 200ul insulin preparation was added into each well for the model group and an equal amount of complete medium was added into each well for the control group. Culture was performed in a 37 5% CO2 and saturated humidity incubator. The supernatant of the corresponding medium was collected according to the time point by centrifugation at 3000 r/min for 5 min and stored at-80 for use. RNA isolation, purification and quantification: Total RNA was isolated and purified using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's procedure. The RNA amount and purity of each sample were quantified using NanoDrop ND-1000 (NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE, USA). The RNA integrity was assessed by Agilent 2100 with RIN number >7.0.cDNA Library Construction: Poly(A) RNA was purified from total RNA (5ug) using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads using two rounds of purification. Then, the poly(A) RNA was fragmented into small pieces using divalent cations under high temperature. Then the cleaved RNA fragments were reverse-transcribed to create the cDNA, which was subsequently used to synthesize U-labeled second-stranded DNAs with E. coli DNA polymerase I, RNase H and dUTP. An A-base was then added to the blunt ends of each strand, which were prepared for ligation to the indexed adapters. Each adapter contained a T-base overhang for ligating the adapter to the A-tailed fragmented DNA. Single- or dual-index adapters were ligated to the fragments, and size selection was performed with AMPureXP beads. After the heat-labile UDG enzyme treatment of the U-labeled second-stranded DNAs, the ligated products were amplified by PCR under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 for 3 min, 8 cycles of denaturation at 98 for 15 sec, annealing at 60 for 15 sec, extension at 72 for 30 sec, and then final extension at 72 for 5 min. The mean insert size for the final cDNA library was 300 bp (+-50 bp). Finally, 150bp paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina Hiseq 4000 (LC Bio, China) following the vendor's recommended protocol.Pathway enrichment analysis: Using the DAVID database and mouse genome as background control, the differentially expressed genes were analyzed by gene ontology under \"FunctionalAnnotation Chart\" functional module. The differentially expressed genes were divided into three categories according to their functions: the biological process, the cell component and the molecular function. Pathway analysis was carried out by KEGG analysis function.",

We previously encountered regulatory processes where dihydrotestosterone (DHT) exerted its inhibitory effect on parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) gene repression through the estrogen receptor (ER)a, but not the androgen receptor (AR) in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Here, we investigated whether such an aberrant ligand-nuclear receptor (NR) interaction is present in prostate cancer LNCaP cells. First, we confirmed that LNCaP cells expressed a functional AR and at negligible levels of ERa, and progesterone receptors. Both suppression of PTHrP and activation of the PSA genes were observed after treatment of E2, DHT and R5020. Consistent with the previous notion that the AR in LNCaP cells lost the ligand specificity due to a mutation AR (Thr-Ala877), our study using siRNA targeting each NR revealed that the AR, but not the other NRs, monopolized the role as the mediator of shared hormone-dependent regulation. These results were invariably associated with nuclear translocation of this mutant AR. Microarray of the genes regulated by either DHT, E2 or R5020 downstream of the AR (Thr-Ala877) revealed that more than half genes overlapped in LNCaP cells. Noticeably, AR (wild-type, wt) and AR (Thr-Ala877) were equally responsible for the E2-AR interactions. Fluorescent microscopic experiments demonstrated that both EGFP-AR (wt) and EGFP-AR (Thr-Ala877) were exclusively localized within the nucleus after E2 or DHT treatment. Further, a promoter assay revealed that breast cancer MCF-7 and Rv22 cells also exhibited such an aberrant E2-AR (wt) signaling. We postulate entangled interactions between the AR (wt) and E2 in a certain hormone-sensitive cancer cells. Total RNAs from the LNCaP cells transfected with control siRNA (siCT) or siRNA for AR (siAR) transfected LNCaP cells before 24 hr followed by exposed to 10-7M of DHT, E2 or R5020 exposure for another 24 h, respectively, were used.",

We generated Stat5a and Stat5b double knock-in (DKI) N-domain mutant mice that form dimers but not tetramers, identified cytokine-regulated genes whose expression required STAT5 tetramers, and defined consensus motifs for dimers versus tetramers.

Extracellular, cancer-specific methylated DNA has been shown to be a prognostic marker when detected in serum or plasma. In this study we investigated the effect of treating cancer cells with differentially methylated CpG DNA. When breast cancer cell lines were treated with methylated CpG DNA, a consistent upregulation of CHAC1 mRNA expression was observed. CHAC1 was recently described to be a novel component of the unfolded protein response pathway. To elucidate the role of CHAC1 mRNA expression in cancer in more detail, we analyzed expression of this gene in breast (n=107) and ovarian cancer (n=107) and found a strong correlation with tumor differentiation. Poorly differentiated tumors exhibited higher CHAC1 expression levels (p=0.004 for breast and p=0.031 for ovarian cancer). Additionally, hormone receptor (HR)-negative breast cancers (p<0.001) and advanced stage disease ovarian cancers (p=0.026) also demonstrated high CHAC1 mRNA levels. mRNA expression analysis of the two known CHAC1 isoforms showed a strong association of expression above the median with poor outcome in breast cancer patients in a multivariate analysis (isoform a: relative risk (RR) of death 3.2 (95% CI 1.6-6.5; p<0.01); RR of relapse 3.9 (95% CI 1.6-9.8; p<0.01); isoform b: relative risk (RR) of death 3.5 (95% CI 1.6-7.3; p<0.01); RR of relapse 6.6 (95% CI 2.4-18.5; p<0.01)). Univariate analysis in ovarian cancer showed that CHAC1 mRNA expression above the median was associated with a poor relapse free survival (p=0.03). In younger ovarian cancer patients (age < median age), a high CHAC1 mRNA expression was associated with overall survival (p=0.007) and relapse free survival (p=0.015). Finally, we show that downregulation of CHAC1 by small interfering RNA suppressed breast cancer cell migration and proliferation, whereas overexpression resulted in an observed increase in these cellular behaviours.

This phenotype could be linked to the loss of the inclusion membrane protein CpoS. We observed a reduction in cell death when infections were carried out in the presence of cycloheximide or actinomycin D, suggesting that the engagement of cell death depends on host transcription and protein synthesis. We applied RNA-Seq to study the transcriptional response of human endocervical epithelial (A2EN) cells to infection with wild-type or CpoS-deficient bacteria. At 6 hpi the transcriptional profiles of cells infected with the two strains were similar to each other and to the transcriptome of uninfected cells.

Mechanistically, HIFAL recruits PHD3 to PKM2 to induce its prolyl hydroxylation and introduces the PKM2/PHD3 complex into the nucleus via binding with hnRNPF to enhance HIF-1a transactivation. Reciprocally, HIF-1a induces HIFAL transcription, which forms a positive feed-forward loop to maintain the transactivation activity of HIF-1a.

Furthermore, HIFAL overexpression promotes tumor growth in vivo, while targeting both HIFAL and HIF-1a significantly rescues their effect on cancer growth.

The glucocorticoid-activated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates cellular stress pathways by binding to genomic regulatory elements of target genes and recruiting coregulator proteins to remodel chromatin and regulate transcription complex assembly. The coregulator Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone 5 (Hic-5) is required for glucocorticoid regulation of some genes, but not others, and blocks regulation of a third gene set. Hic-5 inhibits GR binding to blocked genes but not other glucocorticoid-regulated genes. Site-specific blocking of GR binding is due to gene-specific requirements for ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes. We investigate whether ATPases CHD9 and BRM were required for glucocorticoid-regulated expression of Hic-5 blocked genes. Since Hic-5 inhibits the actions of CHD9 and BRM, we performed double depletion of Hic-5 and CHD9 or Hic-5 and BRM in U2OS-GR cell using siRNA and examined gene expression changes at 8 hour dexamethasone (dex) or ethanol (etoh, vehicle control) treatment.

In neuroblastoma, amplification of the oncogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor (TF) MYCN is the defining prognosticator of high-risk disease, occurs in one-third of neuroblastoma, and drastically reduces overall survival rates1,2. As a proto-oncogene, targeted MYCN overexpression in peripheral neural crest is sufficient to initiate disease in mouse models3. In MYCN amplified neuroblastoma, elevated expression of the factor is crucial to maintain tumor stemness4,5 and is associated with increased proliferation and aberrant cell cycle progression, as these tumors lack the ability to arrest in G1 in response to irradiation6-9. MYCN down-regulation broadly reverses these oncogenic phenotypes in a variety of neuroblastoma models10-12 and recent thereapeutic strategies to indirectly target MYCN production or protein stability have reduced tumor growth in vivo13-15. These observations motivate an investigation of MYCN binding in MYCN amplified tumors as it remains fundamentally unclear how elevated levels of the factor occupy the genome and alter transcriptional programs in neuroblastoma. Here we present the first dynamic chromatin and transcriptional landscape of direct MYCN perturbation in neuroblastoma. We find that at oncogenic levels, MYCN associates with E-box (CANNTG) binding motifs in an affinity dependent manner across most active cis-regulatory promoters and enhancers. MYCN shutdown globally reduces histone acetylation and transcription, consistent with prior descriptions of MYC proteins as non-linear amplifiers of gene expression. We establish that MYCN load at the promoter and proximal enhancers predicts transcriptional responsiveness to MYCN shutdown and that MYCN enhancer binding occurs prominently at the most strongly occupied and down-regulated genes, suggesting a role for these tissue specific elements in predicating MYCN responsive \"target\" genes. At these invaded enhancers, we identify the lineage specific bHLH TWIST1 as a key collaborator and dependency of oncogenic MYCN. These data suggest that MYCN enhancer invasion helps shape transcriptional amplification of the neuroblastoma gene expression program to promote tumorigenesis.

We assessed the effect on whole genome gene expression of two iron chelators (desferrioxamine and Dp44mT). These studies are important for understanding the molecular and cellular effects of iron-depletion. The DMS-53 cells were incubated with either control medium or this medium containing DFO (250 uM) or Dp44mT (25 uM) for 24 h at 37oC. These concentrations were used since our previous studies demonstrated that under these conditions these chelators lead to up-regulation of iron-responsive genes such as the TfR1 after this incubation time.

This analysis confirmed that Olig2+ tumor cells are most similar to OPCs, yet, it identified differences in key progenitor genes - candidates for promotion of differentiation or quiescence.

The pathognomonic EWS/ETS fusion transcription factors drive Ewing sarcoma (EWS) by orchestrating an oncogenic transcription program. Therapeutic targeting of EWS/ETS has not been successful; therefore identifying mediators of the EWS/ETS function could offer new therapeutic targets. Here we describe the dependency of chromatin reader BET bromodomain proteins in EWS/ETS driven transcription and investigate the potential of BET inhibitors in treating this lethal cancer. Similar to EWS/ETS fusions, knockdown of BET proteins BRD2/3/4 severely impaired the oncogenic phenotype of EWS cells. Notably, EWS/FLI1 and EWS/ERG was found to be in a transcriptional complex consisting of BRD4. RNA-Seq analysis upon BRD4 knockdown or its pharmacologic inhibition by the BET inhibitor JQ1 revealed an attenuated EWS/ETS transcriptional signature. In contrast to other reports, JQ1 reduced proliferation, and induced apoptosis through MYC-independent mechanism without affecting EWS/ETS protein levels, which was further confirmed by depleting BET proteins using PROTAC-BET degrader (BETd). Interestingly, polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) associated factor PHF19 was downregulated by JQ1/BETd or BRD4 knockdown in multiple EWS cells. ChIP-seq analysis revealed occupancy of EWS/FLI1 at a distal regulatory element of PHF19 and its subsequent knockdown resulted in downregulation of PHF19 expression. Furthermore, deletion of PHF19 by CRISPR-Cas9 system lead to a decreased tumorigenic phenotype and increased sensitivity to JQ1. Importantly, PHF19 expression was associated with worse prognosis of Ewing sarcoma patients. In vivo, JQ1 demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy in multiple mouse xenograft models of EWS. Together, these results indicate that EWS/ETS require BET epigenetic reader proteins for its transcriptional program including PHF19 expression, which can be mitigated by BET inhibitors. Moreover, this study provides a clear rationale for the clinical utility of BET inhibitors in treating Ewing sarcoma.

Background and objective: The chromosome 13 deletion (del(13)) represents one of the most frequent chromosomal alterations in multiple myeloma (MM). del(13) is associated with an unfavorable prognosis, although there is an increasing agreement that its prognostic relevance has to be related to the ploidy status and the presence of different chromosomal translocations. This study is aimed at providing a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional features of del(13) in MM. Design and methods: Highly purified plasma cells from 80 newly diagnosed MM patients were characterized by means of FISH and high-density oligonucleotide microarray for gene expression profiling and chromosomal alterations. Results: We identified 67 differentially expressed genes in the del(13)+ and del(13)- groups, all of which downregulated in the del(13)+ cases: 44 mapped along the whole chromosome 13, seven on chromosome 11 and three on chromosome 19. Functional analyses of the selected genes indicated their involvement in protein biosynthesis, ubiquitination and transcriptional regulation. An integrative genomic approach based on regional analyses of the gene expression data identified distinct chromosomal regions whose global expression modulation could differentiate del(13)+, in particular the upregulation of 1q21-1q42 and the downregulation of 19p and almost the entire chromosome 11. FISH analyses confirmed the close relationship between del(13)+ and the presence of extracopies of 1q21-1q42 (P=6x10-4) or the absence of chromosome 11 and 19 trisomy (P=5x10-4). Interpretation and conclusions: Our results indicate that distinct types of chromosomal aberrations are closely related to the transcriptional profiles of del(13)+, suggesting that the contribution of del(13) on the malignancy should be considered together with associated abnormalities.Keywords: disease state analysis.

Alterations of the cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction also contribute to those pathological settings. However, the functional interplay between EMT and cell-ECM interaction is poorly understood. Here, we show that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, a potent mediator of inflammation, induces EMT-associated fibrosis in retinal pigment epithelial cells, and that this is regulated by hyaluronan (HA)-CD44-Moesin interaction. TNF-a elicits both HA synthesis and Moesin phosphorylation through protein kinase C activation, promoting binding of CD44 to the newly synthesized HA. The HA-CD44-Moesin interaction leads to cell-cell dissociation through actin remodeling and increased cellular motility associated with mesenchymal phenotype. Furthermore, we established an in vivo model of TNF-a-induced fibrosis in the mouse eye, and the ocular fibrosis was completely suppressed in CD44-null mice. Therefore, HA production and its interaction with CD44 plays essential role in TNF-a-induced-EMT, and the interference of the complex formation can be a new strategy for the fibrotic disorders.

Background: Lung carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) lesions are the pre-invasive precursor to lung squamous cell carcinoma. However, only half progress to invasive cancer in three years, while a third spontaneously regress. Whether modern molecular profiling techniques can identify those pre-invasive lesions that will subsequently progress and distinguish them from those that will regress is unknown. Methods: Progressive and regressive CIS lesions were laser-captured and their genome, epigenome and transcriptome interrogated. We analysed 83 progressive lesions, 41 regressive and 33 normal epithelial control samples. DNA methylation and gene expression profiles were further validated using publicly available lung cancer data. Results: Somatic mutation burden was higher in progressive lesions than regressive CIS lesions, across base substitutions, rearrangements, insertions and deletions. Driver mutations were present in both progressive and regressive CIS lesions, but were more numerous in progressive cases. Progressive and regressive CIS lesions had distinct epigenomic and transcriptional profiles, with a strong chromosomal instability signature. Gene expression, methylation and copy number profiles can all predict accurately which CIS lesions will progress to lung cancer. Conclusion: Pre-invasive CIS lesions that will subsequently progress to invasive lung cancer can be distinguished from those that will regress using molecular profiling. Progression is associated with a strong chromosomal instability signature. These findings inform the development of novel therapeutic targets.

These studies suggest that therapeutic targeting of tumor-promoting macrophages may not only be an effective strategy to block tumor progression and metastasis, but may also have critical implications for breast cancer prevention. To investigate mechanisms that drive tumorigenesis in early breast cancer progression, we employed a transplantable model of preneoplastic progression. Transplantation of p53-null mammary epithelial cells into the cleared mammary fad pads of syngeneic wildtype mice led to the formation of several premalignant lines that histologically and genetically recapitulated the various subtypes of human breast cancer. Two of these lines, PN1a and PN1b, were derived from contralateral outgrowths from the same mouse, and tissue from these outgrowths was serially transplanted for over 10 generations to confirm stability. At 16 weeks post-transplantation, PN1a lesions develop a poorly differentiated, lobuloalveolar morphology with multifocal regions of atypical cells in solid nests, while PN1b lesions remain low grade, ductal hyperplasia. hyperplasia I (PN1a) group and hyperplasia 2 (PN1b) group.",

    "text": "Breaking the epigenetic barrier during reversion of post-implantation epiblast cells. Primitive ectoderm cells (PE) in blastocysts represent the foundation of the pluripotent state, which is lost progressively during development. For example, development of epiblast cells from PE in postimplantation embryos is accompanied by transcriptional and epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation and X inactivation (Refs); these changes alter the nature of epiblast cells fundamentally, affecting their responsiveness to signaling molecules, and constitute a robust boundary that prevents their reversion to a PE-like state. Notably, epiblast cells unlike PE, are refractory to leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF)/STAT3 signalling in vitro; instead, they respond to FGF/Activin to form self-renewing epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) that are like human ES cells, which differ significantly from mouse embryonic stem cells (ES) derived from PE. However, here we show that under appropriate conditions, epiblast cells from postimplantation embryos can respond to LIF/STAT3/fetal calf serum (FCS), and undergo reprogramming to form embryonic stem cell -like cells (repiES: reprogrammed epiblast ES-like cells). Reprogramming of epiblast cells occurs progressively. First, they form colonies that retain key properties of epiblast cells (cEpi: cultured epiblast), which subsequently show erasure of epigenetic modifications, including DNA demethylation and X-reactivation to generate repiES. Analysis also revealed that repiES progressively acquire a transcriptome profile of ES cells that is distinct from cEpi and EpiSCs. In chimeras, repiES contributed to all the tissues, including germ cells. Thus, we show for the first time that reversion of epiblast cells to repiES phenotype entails progressive loss of phenotypic and epigenetic memory of epiblast cells. Our study provides insights into underlying mechanisms, and a tractable model for how signaling molecules induce epigenetic reprogramming of cells leading to an elemental pluripotent state. . We validated our findings concerning reprogramming of epiblast cells by microarray analysis, which showed that repiES are clearly more similar to control ES cells and differ from the cEpi cells, Changes in the transcriptome must also account for the activation of the Oct4-deltaPE-GFP reporter via the distal enhancer. 12 samples.",

Orphan nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRa) has recently been shown to carry negative prognostic significance in breast and ovarian cancers. The specific role of ERRa in tumor growth and progression, however, is yet to be fully understood. The significant homology between estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) and ERRa initially suggested that these receptors may share similar transcriptional targets. Using the well-characterized ERa-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, we sought to gain a genome-wide picture of ERa-ERRa cross-talk using an unbiased microarray approach.Since a small molecule ligand has not been identified for ERRa, its transcriptional activity in these studies was induced using its known coactivator PGC-1a (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g coactivator-1a) as a protein ligand. Both wild-type PGC1, as well as ERRa-specific variant (PGC1 2x9) were used to activate ERRa. Non-NR-dependent activities of PGC-1a were controlled for using a variant PGC-1a in which the leucines within the NR-interacting domain had been mutated to alanines (L2L3M).

Analysis of genes that were differentially expressed in mutant VUB03_DM1 as compared to controls VUB01 and SA01 undifferentiated hES cellsEmbryonic stem (ES) cell lines provide, theoretically, unlimited access to any needed amount of any specific cell phenotype of an organism, due to their unique capacities at indefinite self-renewal and pluripotency (Smith 2001; Trounson 2006). These properties allow using the progeny of ES cell lines to model human pathologies (Martinat, Shendelman et al. 2004; Lerou and Daley 2005; Ben-Nun and Benvenisty 2006). In particular, human ES cell lines derived from embryos characterized as gene-carriers following pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for any one of major monogenic diseases (Pickering, Minger et al. 2005; Mateizel, De Temmerman et al. 2006) may be considered as perfect cellular replicas of those diseases, as they exhibit the exact genotypes associated to them. Here, we confirm this hypothesis by demonstrating that the cell progeny of an ES cell line derived from an embryo with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) displayed the morphological stigma associated to the expression of the mutant gene -so-called intranuclear foci- as well as abnormal alternate splicing of the insulin receptor, a characteristic feature of DM1. Further differential transcriptomic analysis of the DM1 gene-carrying cells with phenotypically similar populations from native ES cell lines revealed abnormal expression of 89 genes, among which 48 were down-regulated and 39 over-expressed. This study demonstrates that DM1, though a disease with relatively late clinical onset, is associated with expression of genetic defects early on during development.

We have developed the transgenic mouse over-expressing HMGA1a in lymphoid cells that develop aggressive lymphoid tumors by 8-10 months with histopathologic findings resembling human T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia. By analyzing the gene expression profiles of our HMGA1a mouse model we plan to identify molecular pathways activated by HMGA1a in lymphoid transformation. Results from these studies will enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies and should lead to the development of better therapies. A total of 20,669 genes represented on the Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 GeneChipTM array were screened with cRNA prepared from lymphoid cells of HMGA1a transgenic mice at different stages in tumorigenesis.

Approximately 1500 RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) profoundly impact mammalian cellular function by controlling distinct sets of transcripts, often using sequence-specific binding to 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) to regulate mRNA stability and translation. Aside from their individual effects, higher-order combinatorial interactions between RBPs on specific mRNAs have been proposed to underpin the regulatory network. To assess the extent of such co-regulatory control, we took a global experimental approach followed by targeted validation to examine interactions between two well-characterized and highly conserved RBPs, Argonaute2 (AGO2) and Pumilio (PUM1 and PUM2). Transcriptome-wide changes in AGO2-mRNA binding upon PUM knockdown were quantified by CLIP-seq, and the presence of PUM binding on the same 3' UTR corresponded with cooperative and antagonistic effects on AGO2 occupancy. In addition, PUM binding sites that overlap with AGO2 showed differential, weakened binding profiles upon abrogation of AGO2 association, indicative of cooperative interactions. In luciferase reporter validation of candidate 3' UTR sites where AGO2 and PUM colocalized, three sites were identified to host antagonistic interactions, where PUM counteracts miRNA-guided repression. Interestingly, the binding sites for the two proteins are too far for potential antagonism due to steric hindrance, suggesting an alternate mechanism. Our data experimentally confirms the combinatorial regulatory model and indicates that the mostly repressive PUM proteins can change their behavior in a context-dependent manner. Overall, the approach underscores the importance of further elucidation of complex interactions between RBPs and their transcriptome-wide extent.

Further, NFI (Nuclear Factor I) proteins have been shown to play important roles in the regulation of gene expression in developing CGNs.To identify NFI-regulated genome-wide targets involved in late maturation of mouse CGNs, we performed two groups of microarray expression analysis: (1) temporal expression arrays using 1.5 and 6 day cultures of mouse CGNs representing immature and more mature CGNs, respectively, which identified 844 Temporal-Up or Down genes; and (2) NFI-regulated genes in 6 day CGN cultures that were infected at the time of plating with lentiviral vectors expressing either NFI dominant repressor (NFI-EnR) or EnR control protein. This identified 686 NFI-Up (NFI-EnR down-regulated) or NFI-Down (NFI-EnR up-regulated) genes.Overlap analysis identified 212 temporal genes that were regulated by NFI. These results indicated that NFI plays a pivotal role in the regulation of late CGN maturation. For temporal arrays, mouse CGN progenitors were purified from P6 mouse cerebellum and cultured for either 1.5 or 6 days. Three biological replicates were analyzed for each time point. For NFI arrays, CGN progenitors from P6 mice were transduced upon plating with either NFI-EnR or EnR control lentivirus and cultured 6 days. Four pairs of biological replicates were performed.",

In order to examine the long term effects of the OPs, murine liver cells (BNL CL.2, ATCC(r) TIB-73) have been exposed to sub-lethal doses of three OPs: diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) representative of sarin and soman, O,S-diethyl methylphosphonothioate (OSD) serving as a simulant for VX, and paraoxon as an example of OP insecticides. Dosing levels of these compounds was set at 20% of the IV LD50 for each, with a 4 hour exposure time. Gene arrays and physiological tests were run at three time points following exposure; 2 hours, 2 days, and 2 weeks. The physiological results showed little to no effect upon exposure to sub-lethal dose of OPs. Gene expression and microRNA (miRNA) profiles using GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays and miRNA arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) found that the OPs did alter expression of genes related to several systems previously implicated in OP exposure with no long term effects. In addition, a significant number of sRNA/snRNA and ribosomal RNA were found to be affected suggesting the need for further study of the changes in these regulators. Three biological replicates of liver cells were exposed to three representative OPs and then harvested at three time points (2 hours, 72 hours, and two weeks) following exposure. These time points were designed for a determination of both early and late effects as well as identification of persistent, chronic changes.

BRAF(V600E) mutant melanomas treated with inhibitors of the BRAF and MEK kinases almost invariably develop resistance, which is frequently caused by reactivation of the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway. To identify novel treatment options for such patients, we searched for acquired vulnerabilities of MAPK inhibitor-resistant melanomas. We find that resistance to BRAF+MEK inhibitors is associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Subsequent treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) vorinostat represses SLC7A11 that leads to a lethal increase in the already elevated levels of ROS in drug-resistant cells, thereby causing selective apoptotic death of only the drug resistant tumor cells. Consistently, treatment of BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma with HDACi in mice results in a dramatic tumor regression. In a study in patients with advanced BRAF+MEK inhibitor resistant melanoma, we find that HDACi can selectively ablate drug-resistant tumor cells, providing clinical proof of concept for the novel therapy identified here. one replicate of RNA Seq data A375, A375R, A375DR vorinostat treated and patient samples pre- post- vorinostat treatment.",

To study differentially expressed genes in neuro-ectodermal cell linesMYCN amplification (NMA) is the most important prognostic factor in neuroblastoma (NBL) patients, however 70% of advanced stage NBL are non-NMA and lack known driving oncogenic events. Gene expression profiles (HU133plus2.0 arrays, Affymetrix) of 17 NBL and 5 peripheral neuro-ectodermal cell lines were used to identify potential subgroups of NBL cell lines with a distinct gene signature. One group of non-NMA NBL cell lines was identified with a distinct gene expression profile and characterized by high expression of AXL. AXL is a tyrosine kinase receptor which plays a role in the metastatic process of cancer. We hypothesized that AXL contributes to the metastasizing potential of non-NMA NBL and tested if AXL silencing diminishes malignant properties of high AXL expressing cell lines. AXL was silenced in two non-NMA NBL cell lines by using a lentiviral shRNA construct that was able to transduce these cell lines with >90% infection efficiency. AXL mRNA expression level was efficiently knocked-down resulting in a severe decrease of migration of AXL positive cell lines GI-M-EN and SH-EP-2, and decreased invasion of GI-M-EN. Morphologically, AXL knockdown induced more rounded cells with a loss of contact. Intracellularly, we observed induction of stress fibers (immunofluorescence F-actin) in GI-M-EN. These changes in cytoskelet were associated with decreased migration. No effects were observed for cell proliferation, apoptosis or downstream pathways. In conclusion, AXL is identified as a possible mediator of NBL metastasis. Arrays were performed with 5 different PNET cell lines, which were used as controls for 17 NBL cell lines (GSE22771).",

Factors which contribute to the adipocyte differentiation and function would be the promising targets to combat the obesity and associated metabolic disorders. The activating transcription factor 7 (ATF7), a stress-responsive chromatin regulator, has recently been shown to be involved in the energy metabolism; however, the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we show that ATF7 is required for adipocyte differentiation and it interacts with histone dimethyltransferase G9a in adipocyte to repress the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression, which suppresses adipogenesis. Ablation of ATF7 promotes the beige biogenesis and browning of inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT). ATF7 binds to the transcription regulatory regions of Ucp1 gene, and silences it by maintaining the histone H3K9 dimethylation level. These results establish the multifunction of ATF7 in adipocyte and provide molecular insights into the epigenetic control of development and function of adipose tissues.We used microarrays to identify the differentatial expression genes in the inguinal white adipose tissue of ATF7 KO mice.

Carbaryl (1-naphthyl-methylcarbamate), a broad-spectrum insecticide, has recently been associated with the development of cutaneous melanoma in an epidemiological cohort study with U.S. farm workers also exposed to ultraviolet radiation, which is known to be the main etiologic factor for skin carcinogenesis. Although comprehensive and well designed, the agricultural epidemiological study was not sufficient to characterize the direct contribution of the insecticide and solar radiation in melanomagenesis. Several studies have explored the synergistic effect of certain chemicals with UV radiation, increasing its deleterious effects on the skin. We hypothesized that carbaryl exposure associated with UV solar radiation may induce melanocyte transformation. This study aimed to characterize human melanocytes after individual or combined exposure to carbaryl (100 mM) and solar radiation (375 mJ/cm2). In a microarray analysis, carbaryl, but not solar radiation, induced an important oxidative stress response, evidenced by the upregulation of antioxidant genes, such as Hemeoxygenase-1 (HMOX1), and downregulation of Microphtalmia-associated Transcription Factor (MITF), the main regulator of melanocytic activity; results were confirmed by qRT-PCR. Carbaryl and solar radiation induced a gene response suggestive of DNA damage and cell cycle alteration. The expression of genes in these categories was notably more intense in the combined treatment group, in a synergistic manner, for CDKN1A, BRCA1/2 and MDM2 genes. Likewise, flow cytometry assays demonstrated S-phase cell cycle arrest, reduced apoptosis levels and faster induction of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) lesions in carbaryl treated groups. Our data suggests that carbaryl is genotoxic to human melanocytes, especially when associated with solar radiation. Twenty-four hours after plating, cells were at 80% confluency and were subjected to the following experimental treatment groups: Group 1: No treatment; Group 2: Irradiation and no treatment; Group 3: Carbaryl treatment; Group 4: Irradiation and carbaryl treatment; Group 5: Vehicle treatment; Group 6: Irradiation and vehicle treatment. Treatment regimen consisted of melanocyte incubation with carbaryl 100 uM (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, USA) for 6 hours after single dose exposure to 375mJ/cm2 of solar radiation using a solar simulator (SS2.5kW, Sciencetech Inc., Ontario, Canada) with a global air mass filter (A.M 1.5G, Sciencetech Inc, Ontario, Canada).

At the 90% sensitivity level, a newly derived prognostic genetic signature achieved 85% specificity. This is the first reported genetic signature to outperform a clinically used postoperative nomogram. Furthermore, a hybrid prognostic signature derived by combination of the nomogram and gene expression data significantly outperformed both genetic and clinical signatures, and achieved a specificity of 95%.

Intellectual disability (ID) is a heterogeneous clinical entity and includes an excess of males who harbor variants on the X-chromosome (XLID). We report rare FAM50A missense variants in the original Armfield XLID syndrome family localized in Xq28 and four additional unrelated males with overlapping features. Our fam50a knockout (KO) zebrafish model exhibits abnormal neurogenesis and craniofacial patterning, and in vivo complementation assays indicate that the patient-derived variants are hypomorphic. RNA sequencing analysis from fam50a KO zebrafish show dysregulation of the transcriptome, with augmented spliceosome mRNAs and depletion of transcripts involved in neurodevelopment. Zebrafish RNA-seq datasets show a preponderance of 3' alternative splicing events in fam50a KO, suggesting a role in the spliceosome C complex. These data are supported with transcriptomic signatures from cell lines derived from affected individuals and FAM50A protein-protein interaction data. In sum, Armfield XLID syndrome is a spliceosomopathy associated with aberrant mRNA processing during development. . To investigate the impact of FAM50A mutations on the transciptome, we performed RNAseq studies using RNA isolated from transformed lymphocyte cells derived from FAM50A patients (K9648, p.Trp206Gly and K9656, p.Glu254Gly) and a healthy control male of northern European origin (three biological replicates in each condition).",

Bivalent H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 chromatin domains in embryonic stem cells keep active developmental regulatory genes expressed at very low levels and poised for activation. Here, we show an alternative and previously unknown bivalent modified histone signature in lineage-committed mesenchymal stem cells and preadipocytes that pairs H3K4me3 with H3K9me3 to maintain adipogenic master regulatory genes (Cebpa and Pparg) expressed at low levels yet poised for activation when differentiation is required. We show lineage-specific gene-body DNA methylation recruits H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1 which methylates H3K9 immediately downstream of transcription start sites marked with H3K4me3 to establish the bivalent domain. At the Cebpa locus, this prevents transcription factor C/EBPb binding, histone acetylation, and further H3K4me3 deposition and is associated with pausing of RNA polymerase II, which limits Cebpa gene expression and adipogenesis.We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and 10Th1lf mesenchymal stem cells and identified up-regulated genes upon knockdown of SETDB1, MBD1, and MCAF1.

Inflammatory disorders including arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and multiple sclerosis are characterised by the excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines resulting in inflammation, tissue damage and chronic pain.In a healthy immune system, the host has developed mechanisms to protect itself from excessive inflammation. One such mechanism is mediated by the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which primarily acts to limit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antigen presenting capabilities of cells in the innate immune system. Since the discovery of IL-10, much emphasis has been placed on extrapolating its exact mechanism of inhibition with the aim of potentiating its use therapeutically. Significantly, the systemic administration of IL-10 has had success in many animal models of inflammation as well as clinical success in human disorders such as psoriasis and Crohn's disease. Despite this, major gaps in our knowledge remain which have weakened the expected therapeutic effect for this anti-inflammatory cytokine.Our early studies discovered that in response to innate immune stimulation, IL-10 can potently inhibit miR-155 (McCoy et al., 2010), a miRNA characterised as a promoter of inflammation and found over-expressed in autoimmune pathologies. This finding suggests that the IL-10/miR-155 axis is a novel mechanism utilised by IL-10 to administer its function. In this study, an Affymetrix array was employed to characterise genes regulated by the IL-10/miR-155 axis in bone-marrow derived macrophages.This project proposal aims to characterise the mechanism of IL-10 inhibition on miR-155, as well as understand the functional outcome and significance of this effect by characterising genes regulated by the IL-10/miR-155 axis.

Progenitor cells maintain self-renewing tissues throughout life by sustaining their capacity for proliferation while suppressing cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation. DNA methylation provides a potential epigenetic mechanism for the cellular memory needed to preserve the somatic progenitor state through repeated cell divisions. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) maintains DNA methylation patterns after cellular replication. Although dispensable for embryonic stem cell maintenance, a clear role for DNMT1 in maintaining the progenitor state in constantly replenished somatic tissues, such as mammalian epidermis, is uncharacterized. Here we show that DNMT1 is essential for supporting epidermal progenitor cell function. DNMT1 protein was found enriched in undifferentiated cells, where it was required to retain proliferative stamina and suppress differentiation. In tissue, DNMT1 depletion led to exit from the progenitor cell compartment, premature differentiation and eventual tissue loss. These effects correlated with DNA methylation as genome-wide analysis revealed that a significant portion of epidermal differentiation gene promoters were methylated in self-renewing conditions but were subsequently demethylated during differentiation. Gene expression analysis: To establish a differentiation signature for primary human keratinocytes, total RNA was isolated in biologic duplicate from cells cultured in growth conditions and high calcium differentiation conditions and hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133 2.0 Plus arrays. This gene signature was also compared to DNMT1 deficient cells cultured in growth conditions.Methylated DNA profiling: To globally characterize DNA methylation in primary human keratinocytes, genomic DNA was immunoprecipitated using a 5-methylcytidine antibody, amplified, and hybridized to NimbleGen HG18 promoter tiling arrays.

For the largest class of human tumors, those of epithelial origin, little is known about their initiating genetic hits or cells of origin. Whether tissue stem cells or more committed progenitors are targets for transformation is also uncertain. Experience in hematopoietic malignancies and sarcomas teaches that recurrent chromosomal translocations represent initiating oncogenic events. To develop a system in which epithelial tumorigenesis can be assessed from the initial event to frank malignancy, we have generated mice that conditionally express the Etv6-NTRK3 (EN) fusion oncoprotein, the product of the t(12;15)(p13;q25) translocation characteristic of one form of human breast cancer. Activation of EN expression in mammary tissues by Whey acidic protein (Wap) promoter-driven Cre leads to fully penetrant, multifocal malignant breast cancer with short latency. We provide genetic evidence that committed, bipotent or CD61+ luminal alveolar progenitors, can be targets of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, EN transforms these otherwise transient progenitors through the AP1 complex. Our model supports the existence of an epithelial cell hierarchy in both normal mammary glands and malignancy. To our knowledge, this is the first murine model of human epithelial cancer based on a recurrent chromosomal translocation. Given increasing relevance of chromosomal translocations in epithelial cancers, such mice serve as a paradigm for the study of their genetic pathogenesis and cellular origins, and generation of novel preclinical models.

TENT4 enzymes generate \"mixed tails\" on mRNAs by adding adenosines with intermittent non-adenosine residues, which protect mRNAs from deadenylation. Here we discover the extensive mixed tailing in the transcripts of two distinct DNA viruses, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and their striking similarity in the mechanism to exploit the TENT4-ZCCHC14 complex. TAIL-seq analyses of HBV and HCMV RNAs revealed that TENT4A and TENT4B are responsible for the mixed tailing and protection of viral poly(A) tails. By fCLIP-seq on HBV-producing cells, we found that the HBV posttranscriptional regulatory element (PRE) is the primary site of the TENT4 interactome. A hairpin with a CNGGN-type pentaloop in the PRE is critical for TENT4-dependent regulation. Unexpectedly, HCMV also utilizes a similar pentaloop hairpin, an interesting example of convergent evolution. We further found that the CNGGN pentaloop is recognized by the SAM domain-containing ZCCHC14 protein which in turn recruits TENT4 to stabilize viral transcripts. Altogether, our study reveals the action mechanism of PRE that has been widely used to enhance gene expression, and introduces the TENT4-ZCCHC14 complex as the key host factor and a potential target for antiviral therapeutics.

    "text": "RNAseq in mast cells. Investigations of teriparatide (rPTH) as a potential treatment for critical defects have demonstrated the predicted anabolic effects on bone formation, and significant non-anabolic effects on healing via undefined mechanisms. Specifically, studies in murine models of structural allograft healing demonstrated that rPTH treatment increased angiogenesis (vessels <30mm), and decreased arteriogenesis (>30 mm) and mast cell numbers, which lead to decreased fibrosis and accelerated healing. To better understand these non-anabolic effects, we interrogated osteogenesis, vasculogenesis and mast cell accumulation in mice randomized to placebo (saline), rPTH (20ug/kg/2days), or the mast cell inhibitor sodium cromolyn (SC) (24ug/kg/2days), via longitudinal micro-CT and multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (MPLSM), in a critical calvaria defect model. Micro-CT demonstrated that SC significantly increased defect window closure and new bone volume versus placebo (p<0.05), although these effects were not as great as rPTH. Interestingly, both rPTH and SC has similar inhibitory effects on arteriogenesis versus placebo (p<0.05) without affecting total vascular volume. MPLSM time course studies in untreated mice revealed that large numbers of mast cells were detected 1 day post-op (43 +/- 17), peaked at 6 days (76 +/- 6), and were still present in the critical defect at the end of the experiment on day 30 (20 +/- 12). In contrast, angiogenesis was not observed until day 4, and functional vessels were first observed on 6 days, demonstrating that mast cell accumulation precedes vasculogenesis. To confirm a direct role of mast cells on osteogenesis and vasculogenesis, we demonstrated that specific diphtheria toxin-a deletion in Mcpt5-Cre-iDTR mice results in similar affects as SC treatment in WT mice. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that mast cells inhibit bone defect healing by stimulating arteriogenesis associated with fibrotic scaring, and that an efficacious non-anabolic effect of rPTH therapy on bone repair is suppression of arteriogenesis and fibrosis secondary to mast cell inhibition.And then, we need to figure out how rPTH works on mast cells. So we used the co-culture of osteoblast and mast cells, and perform RNAseq, by which we aim to screen out the factors in mast cells that are potential mediators for rPTH effects in bone formation, blood vessel formation, and fibrosis formation. Both cell lines were purchased from ATCC(r). Osteoblast cell line, 7F2(ATCC(r) CRL-12557TM). Mast cell line, MC/9(ATCC(r) CRL-8306TM). The culture methods for both cell lines are the same with those provided by ATCC(r). To prepare cells for RNAseq, osteoblasts were seeded and then mast cells were transferred in on the following day. Final concentration 10nM of rPTH was used to treat the cell co-culture for 24 hours. The mast cells were then collected for RNAseq, which was performed at the UR Genomic Research Center at URMC, University of Rochester. The genes with p < 0.05 compared with the average factor of all groups were screened out as candidate genes.",

Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is an incurable pediatric brain tumor, resulting in the death of 200-300 children each year in the United States. Recently it was discovered that approximately 25% of all DIPG cases harbor activating mutations in ACVR1, a gene that encodes Activin A receptor (ALK2), a receptor in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway, and that DIPGs with ALK2 mutations commonly harbor an H3.1K27M mutation. Herein, we used the RCAS/TVA retroviral system to study the effects of ACVR1 mutations and H3.1K27M on DIPG pathogenesis. In vitro expression of R206H ACVR1 with and without H3.1K27M in nestin-expressing brainstem progenitors resulted in upregulation of mesenchymal markers and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed Stat3 pathway activation. Neonatal expression of ACVR1 R206H or G328V in combination with H3.1K27M and p53 deletion in nestin-expressing brainstem progenitors induced glioma-like lesions expressing mesenchymal markers with Stat3 activation but was not sufficient for full gliomagenesis. In combination with platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGFA) signaling, ACVR1 R206H and H3.1K27M significantly decreased survival and increased tumor incidence. We demonstrate that targeting the BMP signaling pathway may be an effective therapeutic strategy to treat ACVR1 R206H mutant DIPGs. Exogenous Noggin expression at tumor initiation significantly increased tumor latency and treatment of ACVR1 R206H mutant murine DIPGs with LDN212854, an ACVR1 inhibitor, significantly prolonged their survival. We confirm relevance of our model to the human disease as human DIPG models with ACVR1 mutations were also sensitive to treatment with LDN212854 in vitro.

Their exact role in natural history and severity of children allergic respiratory disease remains however surprisingly unexplored.Aim: To analyze dysfunctions of epithelium in dust mite allergic respiratory disease (rhinitis +- asthma) in children.Methods: Expression profilings of nasal epithelial cells collected by brushing were performed on Affymetrix Hugene 1.0 ST arrays. All allergic patients were sensitized to dust mite. 19 patients had an isolated allergic rhinitis (AR). 14 patients had AR associated with asthma. Patients were compared to 12 controls, their severity and control being assessed according to NAEPP and ARIA criteria. Infections by respiratory viruses were excluded by real-time PCR measurements.Results: 61 probes were able to distinguish allergic rhinitis children from healthy controls. A majority of these probes was under the control of Th2 cytokines, as evidenced by parallel experiments performed on primary cultures of nasal epithelial cells. In uncontrolled asthmatic patients, we observed not only an enhanced expression of these Th2-responsive transcripts, but also a down-regulation of interferon-responsive genes.Conclusion: Our study identifies a Th2 driven epithelial phenotype common to all dust mite allergic children.

To further explore this issue, we performed a series of superficial and transmural myocardial injuries in C57BL/6 and MRL/MpJ adult mice. At defined time intervals following the respective injury (Days 3, 14, 30 and 60) we examined cardiac function using echocardiography, morphology, FACS cell sorting for BrdU positive cells and molecular signature using microarray analysis. We observed complete restoration of myocardial function in the superficial MRL cryoinjured heart and significantly less scar formation as compared to the injured hearts of C57BL/6 mice. Following a severe transmural myocardial injury, the MRL mouse has increased survival and decreased ventricular remodeling compared to the C57BL/6 mouse but without evidence of significant regeneration. The cytoprotective program observed in the severely injured MRL heart is in part due to increased vasculogenesis and decreased apoptosis that limits the extension of the injury. We conclude that C57BL/6 and MRL injured hearts have evidence of limited myocardial regeneration, in response to superficial injury, but the improved function and survival observed in the MRL mouse heart following severe injury is not due to significant regenerative processes.Keywords: time course.

In wild-type mice, expression of chemokines that are ligands for Ccr2, Cxcr3, and Cxcr2 increased at days 32 to 41 post-infection, with a return to baseline by day 75. Concomitant increases were seen in Ccr2 and Cxcr3 but not in Cxcr2 expression. Induction of these same factors also occurred in CD40-ligand and CD40 knockout mice but only at a much later time-point, during uncontrolled Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Expression of CD4 Th1 markers was increased in wild-type mice during clearance of infection. Ccr2 and Cx3cr1 knockout mice cleared Pneumocystis infection with kinetics similar to wild-type mice, and all animals developed anti-Pneumocystis antibodies. Upregulation of Ccr2 and Cxcr3 and their ligands supports an important role for T helper cells and mononuclear phagocytes in the clearance of Pneumocystis infection. However, based on the current and prior studies, no single chemokine receptor appears to be critical to the clearance of Pneumocystis.

    "text": "Galectin-1 suppression delineates a new therapeutic strategy for myeloma-induced angiogenesis. Galectin-1 (Gal-1) is a lectin, involved in several processes related to cancer, including immunosuppression, angiogenesis, hypoxia, and metastases. Actually, the Gal-1 expression profile in multiple myeloma (MM) and its pathophysiological role in MM-induced angiogenesis and tumoral growth is unknown. Firstly, we found that Gal-1 was expressed by malignant plasma cells in MM patients and that its expression was up-regulated upon hypoxic treatment (1% of O2). Moreover the stable knock-down of Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1a (HIF-1a) in MM cells significantly downregulated Gal-1 expression. Thereafter, we performed Gal-1 inhibition by lentivirus shRNA anti-Gal-1 in human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) showing that its suppression did not affect cell proliferation and survival but modified their transcriptional profiles either in hypoxia or hypoxia condition. Interestingly pro-angiogenic genes including MMP9 and CCL2 were downregulated and those anti-angiogenic SEMA3A and CXCL10 were up-regulated by Gal-1 inhibition in MM cells. Data were also validated by Real time PCR and at protein level. Consistently we found that Gal-1 suppression in MM cells significantly decreased their pro-angiogenic proprieties by an in vitro assay. These evidences were confirmed in mice injected either subcutaneously or intratibially with HMCLs carrying a stable infection with shRNA anti-inhibition of Gal-1 or with the control vector cell line. Gal-1 suppression in both models showed a significant reduction in the tumoral burden and microvascular density compared to the control mice. Moreover, Gal-1 suppression induced smaller lytic lesions on x-ray in the intratibially model. Overall, our data indicate that Gal-1 is a new potential therapeutic target in MM. Total RNA samples from JJN3 anti-Gal-1 and JJN3 scramble, after 48h of normoxic or hypoxic conditions and 48h of re-oxygenation process were analyzed on GeneChip(r) HG-U133 Plus 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix; Santa Clara, CA).

Dr. Stanley's laboratory is interested in 1) understanding the biological roles of specific classes of N-glycan in development and immunity through studies of glycosyltransferase mutant mice, 2) identifying complex binding specificities of galectins using a panel of CHO glycosylation mutants, and 3) determining how O-fucose glycans function in Notch receptor signaling and in modulating the interaction of Notch receptors with their ligands. The bisecting GlcNAc on N-glycans inhibits ricin binding and enhances E-PHA binding. It is expected that mammalian CBP's, including galectins, may have their binding affected positively or negatively by the presence of the bisecting GlcNAc. In fact unpublished experiments have identified reduced binding of at least one galectin to LEC10 CHO cells that express GlcNAc-TIII compared to CHO cells that do not. We have shown that the Mgat3 gene that encodes GlcNAc-TIII, the glycosyltransferase that adds the bisecting GlcNAc, is barely expressed in E9.5 mouse embryos and robustly expressed in E10.5 embryos (J.

Thrombopoietin (Thpo) signals via its receptor Mpl and regulates megakaryopoiesis, hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance and post-transplant expansion. Mpl expression is tightly controlled and deregulation of Thpo/Mpl-signaling is linked to hematological disorders. Here, we constructed an intracellular-truncated, signaling deficient Mpl protein which is presented on the cell surface (dnMpl). The transplantation of bone marrow cells retrovirally transduced to express dnMpl into wildtype mice induced thrombocytopenia, and a progressive loss of HSC. Functional analysis of the truncated Mpl in vitro and in vivo demonstrated no internalization after Thpo binding and the inhibition of Thpo/Mpl-signaling in wildtype cells due to dominant-negative (dn) effects by receptor competition with wildtype Mpl for Thpo binding. Gene expression analysis was performerd of Lin-Sca1+cKit+ (LSK) cells isolated from mice transplanted with dnMpl transduced BM cells. The gene expression profile supported the exhaustion of HSC due to increased cell cycle progression and identified new and known downstream effectors of Thpo/Mpl-signaling in HSC (namely TIE2, ESAM1 and EPCR detected on the HSC-enriched LSK cell population). In summary, we established a novel way of Thpo/Mpl inhibition in the adult mouse and performed in depth analysis of the phenotype including gene expression profiling. BM cells were flushed from the femurs and tibias of C57Bl/6 donor mice. Lineage-marker negative (lin-) cells were isolated by magnetic cell sorting using lineage-specific antibodies (GR1, CD11b, CD45R/B220, CD3e, TER-119).

A population enriched in tumour-initiating potential has been identified in soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) by the isolation of side population (SP) cells. In this study, we compared the gene expression profiles of SP and non-SP cells in STS and identified Hedgehog (Hh) and Notch pathways as potential candidates for the targeting of SP cells. Upon verification of the activation of these pathways in SP cells, using primary tumor xenografts in NOD-SCID mice as our experimental model, we used the Hh blocker Triparanol and the Notch blocker DAPT to demonstrate that the suppression of these pathways effectively depleted the abundance of SP cells, reduced tumour growth, and inhibited the tumour-initiating potential of the treated sarcoma cells upon secondary transplantation. The data provide additional evidence that SP cells act as tumour initiating cells and points to Hh and Notch pathways as enticing targets for developing potential cancer therapies.We used microarrays to detail the difference in gene expressions between the side population cells in soft-tissue sarcoma in comparison to the bulk non-side-population cells. To examine whether certain pathways may be differentially regulated in SP cells versus non-SP cells, which represent the bulk of tumour cells, we compared the gene expression profiles of SP and non-SP cells in four primary STS tumours each from different patient. Upon surgical excision, these tumours were dissociated mechanically and enzymatically into individual cells. Via Hoechst dye staining and flow-cytometry, these primary tumour cells were sorted into distinct side population and non-side population fractions. Total RNA is extracted from an equal number of SP and NSP cell from each primary tumour. cDNA from each sample was generated from the isolated total RNA and hybridized onto Affymetrix Human Genome EukGE-WS2v4 gene chips against the same reference cDNA library. After initial processing of the raw data, using the Genespring(r) GX software, the expression of SP cells from each tumour was normalized against the expression of the corresponding non-SP cells. A gene list was constructed by selecting genes that were regulated in the same direction (SP vs. NSP) in all sample pairs with a fold change greater than 1.25.

Mammalian cells are surrounded by the extracellular matrix (ECM), which regulates intercellular signal transduction and provides structural support to cells. Mechanical forces generated by ECM play a key role in regulating cell behaviors including survival, growth, mobility, and differentiation. However, it is unclear how mechanical forces are sensed by cells and transmit biochemical signals to cell fate-determining transcription factors such as YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif). Here we show the identification of Ras-associated protein 2 (RAP2) as an intracellular signal transducer that senses ECM rigidity and modulates cell survival and growth by negatively regulating YAP/TAZ. Activation of RAP2 by low ECM stiffness or contact inhibition triggers YAP/TAZ phosphorylation. Deletion of RAP2 leads to sustained YAP/TAZ activation in cells that grow on soft matrix or undergo contact inhibition, alters transcription programs initiated by low matrix stiffness, and results in cell transformation and malignant growth. Mechanistically, RAP2 can directly bind to Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4/6/7 (MAP4K4/6/7) or Rho GTPase activating protein 29 (ARHGAP29), both of which lead to LATS1/2 activation and YAP/TAZ inhibition. These findings define a new molecular pathway that transmits mechanical cues to their effectors in the nucleus. The overall goal is to examine expression changes in response to ECM stiffness. mRNA profiles of wild type (WT), RAP2A/B/C-tKO, LATS1/2-dKO, and YAP/TAZ-dKO HEK293A cells were generated using deep sequencing with three biological replicates.",

Purpose: ASA404 (Vadimezan) belongs to a class of agents with disrupting properties against tumor vasculature, which is partly mediated by TNFa-signaling. Our aim was to investigate the potential therapeutic applicability of ASA404 against endocrine tumors. Experimental Design: We determined anti-tumoral effects in preclinical models of neuroendocrine tumors of the gastroenteropancreatic system [1] and adrenocortical cancer (NCI-H295R) by histology and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we characterized these models with their clearly different responsiveness regarding TNFa synthesis and signaling. Results: Upon treatment of tumor bearing mice significant anti-tumoral effects, an increase in TNFa as well as TNFa-specific activation of downstream signaling were evident in the BON tumor model while no comparable effects were detectable for NCI-H295R. Two important modulator of TNFa-signaling, toll-like-receptor 4 (TLR-4) and its adaptor protein LY96 were found highly expressed in BON tumors and transgenic expression in NCI-H295R partly restored TNFa responsiveness. Furthermore, expression of IRAK2-kinase, which has recently been linked to TLR-4-signaling as a mediator of sustained TNFa release was induced upon TNFa-treatment in BON, but not in NCI-H295R cells. Finally, we identified TNFAIP3/A20, a member of an inhibitory feedback-loop downstream of both investigated signaling cascades, as overexpressed in the adrenocortical carcinoma tumor model. Subsequent analyses of clinical patient samples confirmed a correlation between tumor TNFAIP3 expression levels and overall survival in patients with ACC. Conclusions: Taken together our findings provide evidence that modulation of TNFa-signaling could be of relevance both for the clinical course of ACC patients and as a marker of treatment response. BON or NCI-H295R tumor cells were treated in-vitro with TNFalpha and compared to unstimulated cells.",

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare genetic disease characterized by mTOR hyperfunction induced benign tumor growths in multiple organs and neurological symptoms. Because the molecular pathology is highly complex and the etiology poorly understood we employed a defined human neuronal model with a single mTOR activating mutation to dissect the disease-relevant molecular responses driving the neuropathology. TSC2 deficient neural stem cells showed severely reduced neuronal functional maturation and characteristics of astrogliosis instead. Accordingly, transcriptome analysis uncovered an inflammatory response and increased metabolic activity, while ribosome profiling revealed excessive translation of ribosomal transcripts and higher synthesis rates of angiogenic growth factors. Treatment with mTOR inhibitors corrected translational alterations but not transcriptional dysfunction. These results extend our understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of TSC brain lesions, and suggest phenotype-tailored pharmacological treatment strategies.

DHX9 is induced when NGF is limiting and required for apoptosis in cells deprived of NGF. NB1 cells were transduced to incorporate shRNA against DHX9 or a scrambled control, and transfected with a KIF1Bb expression vector or control, then transfected cells were isolated and lysed after 48h.",

Purpose: To investigate the impact of oncogenic Notch on the 3D genome organization of cancer cells.Methods: We generated cohesin HiChIP and 1D epigenomic data sets in two different Notch-dependent cancer cell types, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), in the Notch-on and -off states.Results: We report here that Notch transcription complexes control their direct target genes through two distinct regulatory modes: either through existing loops or by facilitating new long-range regulatory interactions. This combination of pre-existing and Notch-promoted loops coalesce enhancers and promoters to form highly interacting clusters, termed \"3D cliques\". Notch preferentially activates enhancers and promotes looping interactions within highly connected 3D cliques that regulate key oncogenes.Conclusions: These observations suggest a general mechanism that oncogenic transcription factors can exploit to regulate the transcriptional outputs of cancer cells. ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and HiChIP in Notch-on, -off, -recovery conditions in TNBC and MCL cell lines to profile Notch transcriptional complex binding, histone modification, Notch target genes and contact between regulatory elements.",

    "text": "RNA sequencing of mice expressing NLS-hTDP-43. TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is normally a nuclear RNA-binding protein that exhibits a range of functions including regulation of alternative splicing, RNA trafficking and RNA stability. However, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP), TDP-43 is abnormally phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and cleaved, and is mislocalized to the cytoplasm where it forms distinctive aggregates. We previously developed a mouse model expressing human TDP-43 with a mutation in its nuclear localization signal (DNLS-hTDP-43) so that the protein preferentially localizes to the cytoplasm. These mice did not exhibit a significant number of cytoplasmic aggregates, but did display a loss of endogenous mouse nuclear TDP-43 as well as dramatic changes in gene expression as measured by microarray. Here, we analyze RNA-sequencing data from the NLS-hTDP-43 mouse model, together with published RNA-sequencing data obtained previously from TDP-43 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) knockdown mice and High Throughput Sequencing of RNA isolated by CrossLinking ImmunoPrecipitation (HITS-CLIP) data of TDP-43's RNA binding targets to further investigate the dysregulation of gene expression in the NLS model. This analysis reveals that the transcriptomic effects of the overexpression of the DNLS-hTDP-43 transgene are likely due to a gain of cytoplasmic function. Moreover, cytoplasmic TDP-43 expression alters transcripts that regulate chromatin assembly, the nucleolus, lysosomal function, and histone 3' untranslated region (UTR) processing. These transcriptomic alterations correlate with observed histologic abnormalities in heterochromatin structure and nuclear size in transgenic mouse and human brains.

    "text": "CHUK/IKKalpha loss in lung epithelial cells enhances NSCLC growth associated with HIF up-regulation. During the natural progression of Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), tumor cells evolve progressively through the accumulation of mutations, some of which involve oncogenic (K-RAS, EGFR) or tumor suppressor (P53) genes. These mutations alter cell signaling pathways to promote tumor growth and survival in the tumor microenvironment. Herein we show that CHUK (IKK-alpha) acts as a prominent tumor suppressor in two independent NSCLC models.Using a novel transgenic mouse strain, where IKK-alpha gene is ablated using tamoxifen in alveolar type II epithelial cells, loss of IKK-alpha increased the number and size of lung tumors in response to the chemical carcinogen urethane. Furthermore, IKK-alpha knock-down in three human NSCLC lines (showing independent K-Ras or p53 mutations and status) promoted their growth as xenografts in immunocompromised mice. Transcriptomic and functional studies of IKK-alpha knock-down tumors, relative to their wild type counterparts, suggested that the loss of IKK-alpha promoted the activation of HIF-1 alpha and higher tumor cell growth and survival under hypoxic conditions.Together, these results suggest that IKK-alpha acts as a tumor suppressor by suppressing the activity of HIF-1 alpha and tumor cell growth/survival under hypoxic conditions. Tumor RNA samples were sequenced in quadruplicateRNAseq was performed in Human and mouse WT and CHUK-Knockdown NSCLC tumors or tumor xenografts. For human tumor xenografts, three independent human Wt or CHUK-knockdown NSCLC lines (H1437, A549 and H1299), which differ either in their p53 or K-Ras functional status were obtained from the Sanger (UK) cell line database, which provides the status of their K-Ras and p53, EGFR, ARF and p16 alleles. These three human NSCLC lines (IKK WT and IKK KD) and H1299 and A549 (p52WT and p52KD) were grown as tumor xenografts by subcutaneous transplantation into either side (Left side for WT and right side for KD cells) of immune compromised 5 week old NSG (NOD-SCID-IL2Rgamma) mice (2 x 10^6 cells per injection in 200 ml of PBS). Mice were sacrificed 3 weeks and part of the dissected tumors was immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to RNA extraction with the TRI-Reagent (Merck) protocol, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For mouse tumors, Mice with IKKa allele containing LoxP recombination sites and a ROSA-fLacz Cre-inducible LacZ reporter gene were crossed with Sftpc-CreERT2 mice (Rock et al., 2011), which harbor a tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 recombinase under the control of the Sftpc gene promoter that is only active in alveolar type II (AT-II) lung epithelial cells. To induce either IKK or IKK deletion in AT-II lung epithelial cells six week-old male or female mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 5 consecutive days with 2mg tamoxifen (Sigma) dissolved in corn oil. To induce NSCLCs, one week after tamoxifen administration mice received weekly i.p. urethane injections (1g/kg) (Sigma) dissolved in PBS for 12 consecutive weeks, and were sacrificed 6 months after the first urethane injection.",

Murine syngeneic tumor models are the cornerstone of novel immuno-oncology (IO)-based therapy development but the molecular and immunological features of these models are still not clearly defined. The translational relevance of differences between the models is not fully understood, impeding appropriate preclinical model selection for target validation, and ultimately hindering drug development. Within a panel of commonly-used murine syngeneic tumor models, we showed variable responsiveness to IO-therapies. We employed aCGH, whole-exome sequencing, exon microarray analysis and flow cytometry to extensively characterise these models and revealed striking differences that may underlie these contrasting response profiles. We identified strong differential gene expression in immune-related pathways and changes in immune cell-specific genes that suggested differences in tumor immune infiltrates between models. We further investigated this using flow cytometry, which showed differences in both the composition and magnitude of the tumor immune infiltrates, identifying models that harbor 'inflamed' and 'non-inflamed' tumor immune infiltrate phenotypes. Moreover, we found that immunosuppressive cell types predominated in syngeneic mouse tumor models that did not respond to immune-checkpoint blockade, whereas cytotoxic effector immune cells were enriched in responsive models. A cytotoxic cell-rich tumor immune infiltrate has been correlated with increased efficacy of IO-therapy in the clinic and these differences could underlie the varying response profiles to IO-therapy between the syngeneic models. This characterisation highlighted the importance of extensive profiling and will enable investigators to select appropriate models to interrogate the activity of IO-therapies as well as combinations with targeted therapies in vivo. Mouse syngeneic tumour cell lines were grown in vitro n=1 and in vivo n 5 subcutaneously on the backs of mice from their parental strain or orthotopically (see sample records for specific details for each mouse model). Mice were sacrificed when tumours reached an average of 200 mm3. In vitro samples underwent aCGH analysis and transcriptomics analysis while in vivo tumor samples along with a draining lymph node and spleen sample were taken from the same mouse and underwent transcriptomics analysis. Whole exome sequencing and immunophenotyping were also performed on these syngeneic models to in all give a multiomic characterisation of these models.",

However, such mutations often occur in a minority of patients. To investigate the clinical application of targeting Janus Kinase (JAK) for ALK- ALCL, we treated ALK- cell lines of different histologic origins with JAK inhibitors. Interestingly, most exogenous cytokine independent cell lines responded to JAK inhibition regardless of JAK mutation status. JAK inhibitor sensitivity correlated with STAT3 phosphorylation status of tumor cells. Employing retroviral shRNA knockdown, we demonstrated that these JAK inhibitor sensitive cells were dependent on both JAK1 and STAT3 for survival. JAK1 and STAT3 gain-of-function mutations were found in some but not all JAK inhibitor sensitive cells. Moreover, the mutations alone could not explain the JAK1/STAT3 dependency as wild-type JAK1 or STAT3 was sufficient to promote cell survival in the cells that had either JAK1or STAT3 mutations. To investigate whether other mechanisms were involved, we knocked down upstream receptors GP130 or IL-2Rg. Knockdown of GP130 or IL-2Rg induced cell death in select JAK inhibitor sensitive cells. High levels of cytokine expression including IL-6 were demonstrated in cell lines as well as in primary ALK- ALCL tumors. Finally, ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, was effective in vivo in a xenograft ALK- ALCL model. Our data suggest cytokine receptor signaling was required for tumor cell survival in diverse forms of ALK- ALCL even in the presence of JAK1/STAT3 mutations. Therefore, JAK-inhibitor therapy might benefit patients with ALK- ALCL that are pSTAT3+. We performed RNA-seq to examine whether JAK and STAT genes were mutated in these JAK inhibitor sensitive ALK-ALCL cell lines: Mac-1, Mac-2A, Mac-2B, Fe-Pd, TLBR1, and TLBR2,(n=6). pSTAT3 negative ALK-ALCL cell lines DL40 and TLBR3 (n=2) (also JAK inhibitor insensitive) were used as negative cell controls.

    "text": "Identification of Androgen Receptor Modulators in a Prostate Cancer Cell Line Microarray Compendium. High-throughput transcriptomic (HTTr) technologies are increasingly being used to screen environmental chemicals in vitro to identify molecular targets and provide mechanistic context for regulatory testing. The androgen receptor (AR, NR3C4) regulates male sexual development, is involved in the pathogenesis of a number of cancers, and is often the target of endocrine disruptors. Here, we describe the development and validation of a novel gene expression biomarker to identify AR-modulating chemicals using a pattern matching method. AR biomarker genes were identified by their consistent expression after exposure to 4 AR agonists and opposite expression after exposure to 4 AR antagonists. A genetic filter was used to include only those genes that were regulated by AR. Most of the resulting 51 biomarker genes were shown to be directly regulated by AR as determined by ChIP-Seq analysis of AR-DNA interactions. The biomarker was evaluated as a predictive tool using the fold-change rank-based Running Fisher algorithm which compares the expression of AR biomarker genes under various treatment conditions. Using 163 comparisons from cells treated with 98 chemicals, the biomarker gave balanced accuracies for prediction of AR activation or AR suppression of 97% or 98%, respectively. The biomarker was able to correctly classify 16 out of 17 AR reference antagonists including those that are \"weak\" and \"very weak\". Predictions based on comparisons from AR-positive LAPC-4 cells treated with 28 chemicals in antagonist mode were compared to those from an AR pathway model based on 11 in vitro high-throughput screening assays that queried different steps in AR signaling. The balanced accuracy was 93% for suppression. Using our approach, we identified conditions in which AR was modulated in a large collection of microarray profiles from prostate cancer cell lines including 1) AR constitutively active mutants or knockdown of AR, 2) depletion of androgens by castration or removal from media, and 3) modulators that work through indirect mechanisms including suppression of AR expression. These results demonstrate that the AR gene expression biomarker could be a useful tool in HTTr to identify AR modulators in large collections of microarray data derived from AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines. LAPC4 cells were cultured in IMDM media (GIBCO) supplemented with 5% FBS (Omega Scientific) and 1x penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (GIBCO). Cells were plated at 7.5x10^5 cells per well in 1mL media in 24-well plates. After 48 hours, media was replaced with dosing solutions containing DMSO (0.05%), R-1881 (0.33nM) alone or with one of 28 chemicals at the indicated doses. After 6 hours of exposure, media was removed, cells were rinsed with PBS and frozen in Buffer RLT (Qiagen). Experiments were conducted in triplicate (3 individual experiments performed on separate days). Global gene expression was evaluated by microarray analysis. Total RNA was isolated and purified with the RNeasy MinElute column protocol (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany), evaluated for integrity using an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano chip on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies GmbH, Berlin, Germany), and quantitated using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). After randomization, samples were hybridized in a blinded manner onto Human HT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip arrays (Illumina, San Diego, CA) in the EPA NHEERL Genomics Research Core Laboratory using standard Illumina protocols.

The high HbF BCL11A genotype is associated with reduced BCL11A expression. Moreover, abundant expression of full-length forms of BCL11A is developmentally restricted to adult erythroid cells. Down-regulation of BCL11A expression in primary adult erythroid cells leads to robust HbF expression.

Here, we demonstrate that these features are associated with distinct transcriptional programs, with vascular regions showing a Proneural profile and hypoxic regions a Mesenchymal pattern. As these regions harbor glioma stem cells (GSCs), we investigated the epigenetic regulation of these two niches. Proneural, perivascular GSCs activated EZH2, whereas Mesenchymal GSCs in hypoxic regions expressed BMI1 protein, which promoted cellular survival under stress. Using both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition, we found that Proneural GSCs are selectively sensitive to EZH2 disruption, whereas Mesenchymal GSCs are sensitive to BMI1 inhibition. Given that glioblastomas contain both Proneural and Mesenchymal GSCs, combined EZH2 and BMI1 targeting proved more effective than either agent alone both in culture and in vivo, suggesting that strategies that simultaneously target multiple epigenetic regulators within glioblastomas may be necessary to overcome resistance to therapies caused by intratumoral heterogeneity.

UTX deficient iNKT cells exhibit impaired expression of iNKT signature genes due to a decrease in activation-associated H3K4me3 and an increase in repressive H3K27me3 marks within the promoters that UTX occupies. Notably, we identified JunB as a novel regulator of iNKT development that partners with UTX to establish an iNKT lineage specific gene expression program.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is primarily due to coronary atherosclerotic plaque rupture and subsequent thrombus formation. Platelets play a key role in the genesis and progression of both atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Since platelets are anuclear cells that inherit their mRNA from megakaryocyte precursors and maintain it unchanged during their life span, gene expression (GE) profiling at the time of an AMI provides information concerning the platelet GE preceding the coronary event. In ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), a gene-by-gene analysis of the platelet GE identified five differentially expressed genes (DEGs): FKBP5, S100P, SAMSN1, CLEC4E and S100A12. The logistic regression model used to combine the GE in a STEMI vs healthy donors score showed an AUC of 0.95. The same five DEGs were externally validated using platelet GE data from patients with coronary atherosclerosis but without thrombosis.

    "text": "Microprocessor mediates transcription termination in long noncoding microRNA genes. MicroRNA (miRNA) play a major role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. In mammals most miRNA derive from the introns of protein coding genes where they exist as hairpin structures in the primary gene transcript, synthesized by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). These are cleaved co-transcriptionally by the Microprocessor complex, comprising DGCR8 and the RNase III endonuclease Drosha, to release the precursor (pre-)miRNA hairpin, so generating both miRNA and spliced messenger RNA1-4. However, a substantial minority of miRNA originate from Pol II-synthesized long non coding (lnc) RNA where transcript processing is largely uncharacterized5. Here, we show that most lnc-pri-miRNA do not use the canonical cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) transcription termination pathway6, but instead use Microprocessor cleavage both to release pre-miRNA and terminate transcription. We present a detailed characterization of one such lnc-pri-miRNA that generates the highly expressed liver-specific miR-1227. Genome-wide analysis then reveals that Microprocessor-mediated transcription termination is commonly used by lnc-pri-miRNA but not by protein coding miRNA genes. This identifies a fundamental difference between lncRNA and pre-mRNA processing. Remarkably, inactivation of the Microprocessor can lead to extensive transcriptional readthrough of lnc-pri-miRNA, resulting in inhibition of downstream genes by transcriptional interference. Consequently we define a novel RNase III-mediated, polyadenylation-independent mechanism of Pol II transcription termination in mammalian cells.

Targeted therapies have the potential to revolutionize cancer care by providing personalized treatment strategies that are less toxic and more effective but it is clear that for most solid tumors suppression of a single target is not sufficient to prevent development of resistance. A powerful method to identify mechanisms of resistance and targets for combination therapy is to use an in vivo genetic approach. We have developed a novel retroviral gene delivery mouse model of melanoma that permits control of gene expression post-delivery using the tetracycline (tet)-regulated system. In this study we used this melanoma model to select for resistant tumors following genetic inhibition of mutant NRAS. Analysis of tumors that became resistant to NRAS suppression revealed that the most common mechanism of resistance was overexpression of the Met receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). Importantly, inhibition of Met overcomes NRAS resistance in this context. Analysis of NRAS mutant human melanoma cells revealed that inhibition of MEK is also associated with adaptive RTK signaling. Furthermore, co-inhibition of RTK signaling and MEK overcomes acquired MEK inhibitor resistance in NRAS mutant melanoma. These data suggest that combined inhibition of RTK and MEK signaling is a rational therapeutic strategy in mutant NRAS driven melanoma. Reversible NRAS Q61R expression in the melanocytes of DCT-TVA;Ink4a/Arf lox/lox mice (FVB/n) was achieved by transducing the animals with Tet-off and TRE-NRASQ61R-IRES-Cre avian leukosis viruses.

Maternal innate and adaptive immune responses are modulated during pregnancy to concurrently defend against infection and tolerate the semi-allogeneic fetus. The restoration of these systems after childbirth is poorly understood. We reasoned that enhanced innate immune activation may extend beyond gestation while adaptive immunity recovers. To test this hypothesis, the transcriptional profiles of total PBMCs following delivery in healthy women were compared to those of non-pregnant control subjects. Interestingly, interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) encoding proteins such as IFIT1, IFIT2, and IFIT3, as well as signaling proteins such as STAT1, STAT2, and MAVS, were enriched postpartum. Antiviral genes were primarily expressed in CD14+ cells and could be stratified according to genetic variation at the interferon-l3 gene (IFNL3, also named IL28B) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12979860. Antiviral gene expression was sustained beyond six months following delivery in mothers with a CT or TT genotype but resembled baseline non-pregnant control levels following delivery in mothers with a CC genotype. CT and TT IFNL3 genotypes have been associated with persistent elevated ISG expression in individuals chronically infected with hepatitis C virus. Together these data suggest that postpartum, the normalization of the physiological rheostat controlling interferon signaling is dependent on IFNL3 genotype.

The Polycomb group (PcG) gene products mediate heritable silencing of developmental regulators in metazoans, participating in one of two distinct multimeric protein complexes, the Polycomb repressive complexes-1 (PRC1) and -2 (PRC2)1. PRC2 catalyses trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27) which in turn is thought to provide a recruitment site for PRC1. Recent studies demonstrate that mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2A at lysine 119 is important in PcG mediated silencing with the core PRC1 component Ring1A/B functioning as the E3 ligase8. PRC2 has been shown to share target genes with the core transcription network to maintain embryonic stem (ES) cells including Oct4 and Nanog9. Here we identify an essential role for PRC1 in repressing developmental regulators in ES cells, and thereby in maintaining ES cell pluripotency. A significant proportion of the PRC1 target genes are also repressed by Oct4. We demonstrate that engagement of PRC1 and PRC2 at target genes is Oct4-dependent and moreover that Ring1B interacts with Oct4. Collectively these results show that PcG complexes are instrumental in Oct4-dependent repression required to maintain pluripotency of ES cells.

The epidermal specific ablation of Trp53 gene leads to the spontaneous development of aggressive tumors in mice through a process that is accelerated by the simultaneous ablation of Rb gene. Since alterations of p53-dependent pathway are common hallmarks of aggressive, poor prognostic human cancers, these mouse models can recapitulate the molecular features of some of these human malignancies. To evaluate this possibility, gene expression microarray analysis was performed in mouse samples. The mouse tumors display increased expression of cell cycle and chromosomal instability associated genes. Remarkably, they are also enriched in human embryonic stem cell gene signatures, a characteristic feature of human aggressive tumors. Using cross-species comparison and meta-analytical approaches, we also observed that spontaneous mouse tumors display robust similarities with gene expression profiles of human tumors bearing mutated TP53, or displaying poor prognostic outcome, from multiple body tissues. We have obtained a 20-gene signature whose genes are overexpressed in mouse tumors and can identify human tumors with poor outcome from breast cancer, astrocytoma and multiple myeloma. This signature was consistently overexpressed in additional mouse tumors using microarray analysis. Two of the genes of this signature, AURKA and UBE2C, were validated in human breast and cervical cancer as potential biomarkers of malignancy. Our analyses demonstrate that these mouse models are promising preclinical tools aimed to search for malignancy biomarkers and to test targeted therapies of prospective use in human aggressive tumors and/or with p53 mutation or inactivation.

Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common skin cancer and frequently progress from an intraepithelial actinic keratosis. The role of microRNAs during the progression from actinic keratosis to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) remains to be elicited. By using an Agilent microRNA expression microarray we found the expression of miR-204 to be markedly downregulated in cSCC when compared to actinic keratoses. DNA methylation of the TRPM3 promoter region upstream of miR-204-5p was identified as one of the repressive mechanisms that accounts for miR-204 silencing in cSCC. Functional studies on HaCaT cells revealed that this microRNA downregulates the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway and favours the MAPK signaling pathway, likely acting through PTPN11, a tyrosine phosphatase that is a direct miR-204 target. We found that activated STAT3, as detected by pY705-STAT3 immunofluorescence, is retained in the membrane and cytoplasm compartment in AK, whereas cSCC displayed STAT3 in the nuclei. Taken together, our data indicates that MiR-204 may act as a \"rheostat\" that controls the signaling towards the MAPK pathway or the STAT3 pathway. 4 samples were analyzed: HaCaT tansduced with control shRNA (n=2) and HaCaT transduced with shRNA against miR-204 (n=2).",

Steroid hormones are well-recognized suppressors of the inflammatory response, however, their cell- and tissue-specific effects in the regulation of inflammation are far less understood, particularly for the sex-related steroids. To determine the contribution of progesterone in the endothelium, we have characterized and validated an in vitro culture system in which human umbilical vein endothelial cells constitutively express human progesterone receptor (PR). Using next generation RNA-sequencing, we identified a selective group of cytokines that are suppressed by progesterone both under physiological conditions and during pathological activation by lipopolysaccharide. In particular, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL2/3, and CXCL1 were found to be direct targets of PR, as determined by ChIP-sequencing. Regulation of these cytokines by progesterone was also confirmed by bead-based multiplex cytokine assays and quantitative PCR. These findings provide a novel role for PR in the direct regulation of cytokine levels secreted by the endothelium.

There is evidence that the stromal compartment may influence breast cancer responsiveness to chemotherapy. Our aim was to detect a stromal cell signature (using a direct approach of microdissected stromal cells) associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer, considering tumor down staging (to at least ypT1a/b,ypN0), as the best response. Patients and methods. Forty four patients diagnosed with locally advanced breast cancer (29 classified as estrogen receptor (ER) positive and 15, as ER negative) were included. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisted of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide, followed by paclitaxel. Response was defined as downstaging to maximum ypT1a-b/ypN0. Stromal cells were microdissected from fresh frozen tumor samples and gene expression profile was determined using Agilent SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression Microarrays. Expression levels were compared using MeV (MultiExperiment Viewer) software, applying SAM (Significance analysis of microarrays). Gene set enrichment analysis was used to identify gene sets correlated with the phenotype downstaging. Results: After chemotherapy, nine patients presented disease downstaging to maximum ypT1a-b/ypN0. Using SAM test (FDR 17), 11 sequences were differentially expressed, all of which (except for H2AFJ) more expressed in responsive tumors. Gene list enrichment analysis revealed three genes involved in abnormal cytotoxic T cell physiology: TOX, LY75 and SH2D1A. Gene sets correlated with tumor downstaging (FDR < 0.01), were mainly involved in immune response or lymphocyte activation, both in ER positive and ER negative samples. Conclusion: In locally advanced breast cancer, stromal cells may present specific features of immune response that may be associated with chemotherapy response.

LIN28A is expressed in various types of cancer, and they are associated with advanced tumor malignancy. In embryonic stem cell, LIN28A specifically binds to let-7 precursors to suppress biogenesis of the let-7 microRNA family. In addition, LIN28A was reported to bind several mRNAs such as Oct4, cyclin A/B and histone H2A to activate their translation.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including atherosclerosis, are globally the leading cause of death. Key factors contributing to onset and progression of atherosclerosis and plaque development include the pro-infslammatory cytokines Interferon (IFN)a and IFNg and the Pattern Recognition Receptor (PRR) Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Together, they trigger activation of members of the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) family. Searches for STAT3-targeting compounds, exploring the pTyr-SH2 interaction area of STAT3, yielded many small molecules, including STATTIC and STX-0119. However, many of these inhibitors do not seem STAT-specific. We hypothesized that non-specific STAT-inhibitors that simultaneously block STAT1, STAT2 and STAT3 activity and pro-inflammatory target gene expression may be a promising avenue for the treatment of CVD. We developed a pipeline approach combining comparative in silico docking of multiple STAT-SH2 models on multi-million Clean Lead and Clean Drug-Like libraries with in vitro STAT inhibition validation, as a novel STAT-inhibitory selection strategy. This approach allowed us to identify a new type of non-specific STAT inhibitor, C01L_F03 targeting the SH2 domain of STAT1, 2 and 3 with equal affinity. Moreover we observed a similar STAT cross-binding mechanism for STATTIC and STX-0119, leading to genome-wide inhibition of pro-atherogenic gene expression. Consequently, a multi-STAT inhibitory strategy was applied to inhibit endothelial cell (EC) migration, leukocyte adhesion to ECs and impairment of aortic ring contractility under inflammatory conditions.

Hepatoblastoma is a primitive liver cancer occurring mainly in infants with defined molecular alterations driving its progression, which is difficult to model in vivo.

Expression of classic tumor-associated proteins such as b-catenin, EpCAM and CK19 was maintained in acini-like organized tumors on CAM, as was synthesis of AFP, a tumor marker used for monitoring patient response. RNA sequencing revealed an unexpected molecular evolution of hepatoblastoma cells on the CAM, with significant deregulation of more than 6000 genes including more than half of all HOX genes. Bioinformatic analysis could clearly distinguish between tumor cell-expressed genes and chick host genes, thereby shedding new light on the complex interactions taking place during experimental hepatoblastoma progression. Importantly, human tumor suppressive ribosomal genes were downregulated after implantation, whereas mitochondrial genes encoding for anti-apoptotic peptides were strongly induced in vivo. Meprin-1a expression was increased during evolution of CAM tumors and confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Cisplatin, a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent for hepatoblastoma, showed significant anti-tumoral effects in this model.

MOV10 and MOV10L1 are two homologous RNA helicases implicated in distinct intracellular pathways. MOV10L1 participates specifically in Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) biogenesis and protects mouse male fertility. In contrast, the functional complexity of MOV10 remains incompletely understood, and its role in the mammalian germline is unknown. Here we report a study of the biological and molecular functions of the RNA helicase MOV10 in mammalian male germ cells.Results: MOV10 is a nucleocytoplasmic protein mainly expressed in spermatogonia. Knockdown and transplantation experiments show that MOV10 deficiency has a negative effect on spermatogonial progenitor cells (SPCs), limiting proliferation and in vivo repopulation capacity. This effect is concurrent with a global disturbance of RNA homeostasis and downregulation of factors critical for SPC proliferation and/or self-renewal. Unexpectedly, microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis is impaired due partially to decrease of miRNA primary transcript levels and/or retention of miRNA via splicing control. Genome-wide analysis of RNA targetome reveals that MOV10 binds preferentially to mRNAs with long 3'-UTR, and also interacts with various non-coding RNA species including those in the nucleus. Intriguingly, nuclear MOV10 associates with an array of splicing factors, particularly with SRSF1, and its intronic binding sites tend to reside in proximity to splice sites.Conclusions: These data expand the landscape of MOV10 function and highlight a previously unidentified role initiated from the nucleus, suggesting that MOV10 is a versatile RBP involved in a broader RNA regulatory network. Triplicate identification of transcripts associated with MOV10 in mice testes, triplicate mRNA profiles and miRNA profile of Mov10 knockdown and control in spermatogonial progenitor cells were generated by deep sequencing.",

Differentially expressed genes were analyzed on the Hep3B cells transfected with HDAC2 shRNAs, and recapitulated molecular signatures that related to hallmarks of cancer. With the aim of identifying changes in gene expression following gene knockdown of HDAC2, we performed expression profiling in shRNA expression vector-transfected Hep3B cells, and compared the results to those obtained from vector-transfected Hep3B cells.",

Cockayne syndrome (CS) is an autossomal human disorder characterized by premature aging along with other symptoms. At the molecular level, CS is characterized by a deficiency in the Transcription-couple DNA repair pathway caused by a mutation mainly in ERCC6 gene and the absence of its functional protein. It has been shown that the presence of DNA damage and the lack of some functional proteins related to DNA repair constitute a barrier for somatic cell reprogramming. Recently, it was demonstrated that one protein involved in Genome Global Repair controls the expression of an important pluripotent gene, highligting its importance for cellular reprogramming.We used microarray to confirm cellular reprogramming of CS fibroblasts at the molecular level and detail the expression of some genes invoved in cell death and aging control that might explain the unique characteristics of these iPSCs. Normal (wild type) and fibroblasts from a CS patient were reprogrammed and independent clones were isolated. After sucessive passages in culture, total RNA from donor fibroblasts, iPSCs clones and human embryonic stem cell line (HUES6) were isolated and transcriptional analysis using human genome Affimetrix Gene Chip arrays were performed. HUES6 was used to demonstrate that CS and normal iPSCS show a global gene expression similar to an embryonic stem cell, confirming that both fibroblasts were successfully reprogrammed. We also used fibroblasts from CS to point out the diiferences in global gene expression after reprogramming. We sought to use normal (control) iPSCs to compare the levels of some genes involved in cell death and aging in iPSCs from CS fibroblasts.",

Purpose: The aims of this study were to identify differentially expressed genes between Kdm6bf/f and Col2a1-CreERT2;Kdm6bf/f primary chondrocytes. Methods: RNA samples of primary chondrocytes were prepared from Kdm6bf/f and Col2a1-CreERT2;Kdm6bf/f mice and were sequenced and analyzed by Shanghai Novel Bioinformatics Co, Ltd. Before read mapping, clean reads were obtained from the raw reads by removing the adaptor sequences, reads with >5% ambiguous bases (noted as N) and low-quality reads containing more than 20 percent of bases with qualities of <13. The clean reads were then aligned to the mouse genome (version: hg19_GRCh37) using the MapSplice program (v2.1.6). We applied EBseq algorithm to filter the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), after the significant analysis and FDR analysis under the following criteria: i) Fold Change>2 or <0.5; ii) FDR<0.05. DEGs were used for gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis. We downloaded the GO annotations from NCBI, UniProt and the Gene Ontology. Fisher's exact test was applied to identify the significant GO categories and FDR was used to correct the p-values. Pathway analysis was used to determine the significant pathway of the differentially expressed genes according to the KEGG database. The Fisher's exact test was utilized to select the significant pathway, and the threshold of significance was defined by P-value and FDR. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of the role of Kdm6b in joint cartilage development and homeostasis, which provided a new therapeutic modalities for OA treatment. Kdm6bf/f and Col2a1-CreERT2;Kdm6bf/f primary chondrocytes were treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OH-TM) (1 mM) for 48 hours, and then RNA samples were prepared from these cells for RNA-Seq.",

This makes it an interesting target for mechanistic study and treatment of atherosclerosis.METHODS AND RESULTS:We optimized a promising stilbenoid structure (STX4) in order to reach nanomolar effective concentrations in LXRa reporter-gene assays. STX4 displayed the unique property to activate LXRa effectively but not its subtype LXRb. The potential of STX4 to increase transcriptional activity as an LXRa ligand was tested with gene expression analyses in THP1-derived human macrophages and oxLDL-loaded human foam cells. Only in foam cells but not in macrophage cells STX4 treatment showed athero-protective effects with similar potency as the synthetic LXR ligand T0901317 (T09). Surprisingly, combinatorial treatment with STX4 and T09 resulted in an additive effect on reporter-gene activation and target gene expression. In physiological tests the cellular content of total and esterified cholesterol was significantly reduced by STX4 without the undesirable increase in triglyceride levels as observed for T09.CONCLUSIONS:STX4 is a new LXRa-ligand to study transcriptional regulation of anti-atherogenic processes in cell or ex vivo models, and provides a promising lead structure for pharmaceutical development. 2 treatment groups (STX4 vs. DMSO in foam cells), 3 biological replicates per treatment (6 samples in total), each representing one well from cell culture plate2 treatment groups (STX4 vs. DMSO in macrophages), 4 biological replicates per treatment (8 samples in total), each representing one well from cell culture plate2 treatment groups (T0901317 vs. DMSO in foam cells), 3-4 biological replicates per treatment (7 samples in total), each representing one well from cell culture plate2 treatment groups (T0901317 vs. DMSO in macrophages), 4 biological replicates per treatment (8 samples in total), each representing one well from cell culture plate.",

Genomic imprinting is a critical developmental process characteristic of parent-of-origin- specific gene expression.

Indeed, our genome-wide studies demonstrate that Aff3 specifically binds both imprinting control regions (ICRs) and enhancers within imprinted loci in an allele-specific manner. We have identified the molecular regulators involved in the recruitment of Aff3 to ICRs to impede transcription through the ICR, and provide a mechanism requiring Aff3 within the Super Elongation Complex-like 3 (SEC-L3) in the expression of an imprinted polycistronic transcript spanning the Dlk1-Dio3 locus.

To determine whether lncRNAs are associated with clinical features and recurrent mutations in older patients (aged >=60 years) with cytogenetically normal (CN) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we evaluated lncRNA expression in 148 untreated older CN-AML cases using a custom microarray platform. In this study, we analyzed a large set of older CN-AML patients using custom lncRNA microarrays to investigate whether lncRNA expression is associated with clinical features, molecular abnormalities and outcome and to build a prognostic lncRNA signature that was subsequently validated using RNA sequencing.This submission represents RNA-Seq component of study.",

Glucose transporters are the first and rate-limiting step for cellular glucose usage, which is often exacerbated in tumour cells enabling their growth and proliferation. Although inhibiting glucose metabolism in lung tumours could become an efficient treatment strategy, whether and which glucose transporter(s) should be targeted remains unclear because of their possible functional redundancy, and because other nutrients or transporter-independent metabolic processes including autophagy and macropinocytosis can fuel tumour cell growth in certain contexts. Here we show that glucose transporter Glut1 gene deletion in tumour cells does not impact tumour initiation and only slightly delays progression in a genetically-engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. Using 13C-glucose tracing with correlated nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) and electron microscopy, we report the presence of multiple lamellar body-like organelles produced by tumour cells. Glucose-derived biomass accumulates in these organelles, and this accumulation is decreased in Glut1-deficient tumour cells. Ex vivo, tumour cell glycolysis is impaired in absence of Glut1 except in case of strong expression of another glucose transporter, Glut3. We show that Glut3 is dispensable for Glut1 wild-type tumour development. In contrast, their combined deletion diminishes tumour growth and prevents the appearance of big lesions. Our results demonstrate the requirement for two glucose transporters in lung adenocarcinoma; dual blockade could reach therapeutic responses not achieved by individual targeting.

Histone modifications, largely regulated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been recognized as major regulatory mechanisms governing human diseases including cancer. Despite significant effort and recent advances, the mechanism by which the p300 transcriptional coactivator mediates tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here, we use a genetic and chemical approach to identify the Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) as a critical downstream target of p300 driving human melanoma growth. We find that direct transcriptional control of MITF by p300-dependent histone acetylation within proximal gene regulatory regions is coupled to cellular proliferation, suggesting a significant growth regulatory axis. Further analysis revealed Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) as a key effector of the p300-MITF axis driving cell growth, which is selectively activated in human melanomas. Targeted chemical inhibition of p300 histone acetyltransferase activity using a potent and selective catalytic p300/CBP inhibitor confirmed the critical role of the p300-MITF-FOXM1 axis in melanoma and demonstrated significant growth inhibitory effects in melanoma cells expressing high levels of MITF. These data support p300 as a promising novel epigenetic therapeutic target in human melanoma. In order to obtain a comprehensive assessment of p300 downstream effector genes in human melanoma, we performed genome-wide expression profiling analysis of WM983B and SK-Mel5 melanoma cells following p300 depletion.

Hippo-YAP signaling pathway is a highly conserved pathway during evolution. It involves in a broad spectrum of physiological and pathological procedure. It also functions in early lineage differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, but the detailed mechanisms remain elusive. Our previous research revealed that knockout of Mst1 and Mst2, the key components of Hippo signaling in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), led ESCs preferentially differentiate into ectoderm lineage, and the differentiation to mesoderm and endoderm lineage was disturbed. To uncover the underlying regulatory mechanisms, we performed ChIP-seq experiments with antibodies against Yap, master transcription factors and some characterized histone modification markers. Combined with RNA-seq assays of wild type and Mst KO ESCs and day 4 embryoid bodies (EBs), we found that YAP is preferentially enriched at Nanog, Sox2, Oct4 and H3K27Ac co-marked super-enhancers (SEs) in ESCs. The upregulation of YAP in Mst KO ESCs resulted in the formation of new super-enhancers on lineage associated genes, leading to the upregulation of these genes and the distortion of ESC differentiation. Hence, our study revealed a super-enhancer related ESC lineage differentiation mechanism which can be shaped by Hippo-YAP signaling. Examination of ES and EB in 2 cell types.",

[Methods]: We developed a novel proteomic strategy for identifying and profiling antigens in immune complexes (ICs) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 26 NPSLE patients. We performed in vitro experiments using astrocytes and analyzed functional change by microarray.

Microarray data showed that the senescence and autophagy pathways were significantly changed in astrocytes with anti-SBSN antibody exposure compared to normal immunoglobulin G (IgG) exposure. [Conclusions]: These findings indicate that SBSN could be a novel autoantibody for the evaluation of suspected NPSLE, and may help elucidate the pathogenesis underlying this disease.

Analysis of Early Myogenesis Reveals an Extensive Set of Transcriptional Regulators Whose Knock-down Can Inhibit DifferentiationMyogenesis is a tightly controlled process involving the transcriptional activation and repression of thousands of genes. Although many components of the transcriptional network are known for the later phases of myogenesis, relatively little work has described the transcriptional landscape within the first 24 hours, when myoblasts commit to differentiate. Through dense temporal sampling of differentiating C2C12 myoblasts, we identify 266 transcriptional regulators (TRs) whose expression is altered within the first 12 hours of myogenesis. A high-content shRNA screen of 76 TRs involving 427 stable lines identified 48 genes whose knockdown significantly inhibits differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. These include known regulators of myogenesis (Myod1, Myog and Myf5), as well as 26 regulators not previously associated with the process. Of the TRs differentially expressed within the first 24 hours, two-thirds inhibited differentiation when knocked down. Surprisingly, a similar proportion (67%) of shRNAs targeting TRs whose expression did not change during differentiation also inhibited myogenesis, suggesting that both stably and differentially expressed TRs are essential for this complex differentiation program. This implies that microarray-based approaches that concentrate functional validation studies on differentially-expressed genes will fail to identify many genes that are critically implicated in complex biological processes. C2C12 myoblasts were differentiated into myotubes and sampled at various timepoints for gene expression measurement on MOE-430v2 chips. Cells grown in separate plates were harvested at 14 different timepoints: t_-24h, t_0h, t_0.5h, t_1h, t_1.5h, t_2h, t_3h, t_6h, t_9h, t_12h, t_24h, t_48h, t_96h, t_144h.

To guide precision cancer treatment, we performed extensive biological characterization of the activity of PTC299 and demonstrated that inhibition of VEGF production and cell proliferation by PTC299 is linked to a decrease in uridine nucleotides by targeting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a rate limiting enzyme for de novo pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis.

PTC299 has broad and potent activity against hematological cancer cells in preclinical models, reflecting a reduced pyrimidine nucleotide salvage pathway in leukemia cells.

We analyze and compare molecular responses, in term of gene expression profile (GEP) changes, induced by 9 and 23Gy of ionizing radiation (IR) in immortalized and primary cell cultures grouped according their Estrogen (ER) and Progesteron (PR) receptors positive or negative expression. Our explorative study gives some comprehensive hallmarks of the effects of the irradiation in BC cells. We trust that this study could have a role in driving RT towards personalised treatments, based also on the molecular characterization in BC. Radiation-induced gene expression changes in non- tumorigenic (MCF10A) and in tumorigenic breast (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) immortalized cell lines; and in healthy (HMEC) and BC (BCpc7 and BCpcEMT) primary cultures obtained from surgical biopsies, were analyzed as two-color hybridizations using Agilent Technologies whole human genome 4x44K microarrays.

    "text": "TFEB controls vascular development by regulating the proliferation of endothelial cells. The role of the transcription factor EB (TFEB) in the control of cellular functions, including in vascular bed, is mostly thought to be the regulation of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagic flux. While this is its best-known function, we report here the ability of TFEB to orchestrate a non-canonical program involved in the control of cell-cycle and VEGFR2 pathway in the developing vasculature. In endothelial cells, TFEB deletion halts proliferation by inhibiting the CDK4/Rb pathway, which regulates the cell cycle G1-S transition. In an attempt to overcome this limit, cells compensate by increasing the amount of VEGFR2 on the plasma membrane through a microRNA-mediated mechanism and the control of its membrane trafficking. TFEB transactivates the miR-15a/16-1 cluster, which limits the stability of the VEGFR2 transcript, and negatively modulates the expression of MYO1C, which regulates VEGFR2 delivery to the cell surface. In TFEB knocked-down cells, the reduced and increased amount respectively of miR-15a/16-1 and MYO1C result in the overexpression on plasmamembrane of VEGFR2, which however shows low signaling strength. Using endothelial loss-of-function Tfeb mouse mutants, we present evidence of defects in fetal and newborn mouse vasculature caused by the reduced endothelial proliferation and by the anomalous function of VEGFR2 pathway. Thus, this study revealed a new and unreported function of TFEB that expands its role beyond the regulation of autophagic pathway in the vascular system. This SuperSerie is composed of the SubSeries listed below. In the first experiment we report the ChIP-seq of the TFEB transcription factor in a model of HUVEC cells. In the second one, we study the effect of the down-modulation of the TFEB transcription factor, in the same model.",

To fully comprehend how genetic variants influence phenotypes, we must understand the functions of the epigenome. To assess the degree to which genetic variants influence epigenome activity, we integrate epigenetic and genotypic data from lupus patient lymphoblastoid cell lines to identify variants that induce allelic imbalance in the magnitude of histone post-translational modifications, referred to herein as histone quantitative trait loci (hQTLs). We demonstrate that enhancer hQTLs are enriched on autoimmune disease risk haplotypes and disproportionately influence gene expression variability compared with non-hQTL variants in strong linkage disequilibrium. We show that the epigenome regulates HLA class II genes differently in individuals who carry HLA-DR3 or HLA-DR15 haplotypes, resulting in differential 3D chromatin conformation and gene expression. Finally, we identify significant expression QTL (eQTL) x hQTL interactions that reveal substructure within eQTL gene expression, suggesting potential implications for functional genomic studies that leverage eQTL data for subject selection and stratification.

Progressive failure of insulin-producing beta cells is the central event leading to diabetes, yet the signalling networks controlling beta cell fate remain poorly understood. Here we show that SRp55, a splicing factor regulated by the diabetes susceptibility gene GLIS3, has a major role in maintaining function and survival of human beta cells. RNA-seq analysis revealed that SRp55 regulates the splicing of genes involved in cell survival and death, insulin secretion and JNK signalling. Specifically, SRp55-mediated splicing changes modulate the function of the pro-apoptotic proteins BIM and BAX, JNK signalling and endoplasmic reticulum stress, explaining why SRp55 depletion triggers beta cell apoptosis. Furthermore, SRp55 depletion inhibits beta cell mitochondrial function, explaining the observed decrease in insulin release. These data unveil a novel layer of regulation of human beta cell function and survival, namely alternative splicing modulated by key splicing regulators such as SRp55 that may crosstalk with candidate genes for diabetes.

To better understand the molecular basis of the anticancer effects of acyclic retinoid (ACR), a genome-wide screening was applied to identify novel targets of ACR in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells JHH7. Gene expression profiles of JHH7 were measured at 0h, 1h and 4 hours after treatment with1 mM All-trans retinoic acid (AtRA) or 10 mM ACR. Hierarchical clustering with Ward's method of 44,907 genes demonstrated diverse expression changes in HCC cells treated with ACR for 4h. A total of 973 differentially expressed genes in response to ACR by comparing with AtRA for 4h treatments were identified with a fold change more than 2. Then, network analysis was performed on the altered gene expression profiles using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) program. The most highly populated networks were associated with the regulation of cell cycle and DNA replication, as ACR is well known to induce apoptosis and suppress cell proliferation in HCC cells. Moreover, networks related with amino acid metabolism, protein synthesis and lipid metabolism, such as the biological network entitled \"Lipid Metabolism, Small Molecular Biochemistry, Vitamin and Mineral Metabolism\" were also observed. Of interest, this network contains genes that play critical roles in controlling the development of tissues and organs such as the nuclear orphan receptor nuclear receptor subfamily 2, group F, member 2 (NR2F2), suggesting potential drug targets to prevent/treat HCC.

Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are hormone-regulated transcription factors that regulate a diverse array of biological activities, including metabolism, homeostasis, and development. TRs also serve as tumor suppressors, and aberrant TR function (via mutation, deletion, or altered expression) is associated with a spectrum of both neoplastic and endocrine diseases. A particularly high frequency of TR mutations has been reported in renal clear cell carcinoma (RCCC) and in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We have shown that HCC-TR mutants regulate only a fraction of the genes targeted by wild-type TRs, but have gained the ability to regulate other, unique, targets. We have suggested that this altered gene recognition may contribute to the neoplastic phenotype. Here, to determine the generality of this phenomenon, we examined a distinct set of TR mutants associated with RCCCs. We report that two different TR mutants, isolated from independent RCCC tumors, possess greatly expanded target gene specificities that extensively overlap one another, but only minimally overlap that of the WT-TRs, or those of two HCC-TR mutants. Many of the genes targeted by either or both RCCC-TR mutants have been previously implicated in RCCC, and include a series of metallothioneins, solute carriers, and genes involved in glycolysis and energy metabolism. We propose that TR mutations from RCCC and HCC are likely to play tissue-specific roles in carcinogenesis, and that the divergent target gene recognition patterns of TR mutants isolated from the two different types of tumors arises from different selective pressures during development of RCCC versus HCC. Gene expression was analyzed in HepG2 transformants expressing ectopic wildtype THRA, wildtype THRB, HCC-TR mutants aI and bN, and RCCC-TR mutants 6a and 15b using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays in the presence or absence of T3.

Fusion of donor mesenchymal stem cells with parenchymal cells of the recipient can occur in the brain, liver, intestine and heart following transplantation. The therapeutic benefit or detriment of resultant hybrids is unknown. Here we sought a global view of phenotypic diversification of mesenchymal stem cell-cardiomyocyte hybrids and associated time course. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we found hybrids consistently increase ribosome components and decrease genes associated with the cell cycle suggesting an increase in protein production and decrease in proliferation to accommodate the fused state. But in the case of most other gene groups, hybrids were individually distinct. In fact, though hybrids can express a transcriptome similar to individual fusion partners, approximately one-third acquired distinct expression profiles in a single day. Some hybrids underwent reprogramming, expressing pluripotency and cardiac precursor genes latent in parental cells and associated with developmental and morphogenic gene groups. Other hybrids expressed genes associated with ontologic cancer sets and two hybrids of separate experimental replicates clustered with breast cancer cells, expressing critical oncogenes and lacking tumor suppressor genes. Rapid transcriptional diversification of this type garners consideration in the context of cellular transplantation to damaged tissues, those with viral infection or other microenvironmental conditions that might promote fusion. Examination was performed using single-cell RNA-seq of five fusion products (BiFC_D1_F1-5, 24 hours) identified using BiFC, twenty-three fusion products (DC_D1_F1-16, 24 hours; DC_D3_F1-7, 72 hours) identified using dual expression of GFP and mCherry, the parental controls, and the population controls (mMSC_PC and HL1cm_PC).

    "text": "Expression of Wnt Receptors in Adult Spiral Ganglion Neurons: Fzd 9 Located at Growth Cones of Regenerating Neurites. The fidelity of sound transmission by cochlear implants in patients with sensorineural hearing loss could be greatly improved by increasing the number of frequency channels. This could be achieved by stimulating and guiding neurite outgrowth to reduce the distance between the implant's electrodes and the remnants of the spiral ganglion neurons. However, little is known about signaling pathways, besides those of neurotrophic factors, that are operational in the adult spiral ganglion. To systematically identify neuronal receptors for guidance cues in the adult cochlea, we conducted a genome-wide cDNA microarray screen with two-month-old CBA/CaJ mice. A meta-analysis of our data and those from older mice in two other studies revealed the presence of neuronal transmembrane receptors that represent all four established guidance pathways--ephrin, netrin, semaphorin, and slit--in the mature cochlea as late as 15 months. In addition, we observed the expression of all known receptors for the Wnt morphogens, whose neuronal guidance function has only recently been recognized. In situ hybridizations located the mRNAs of the Wnt receptors frizzled 1, 4, 6, 9, and 10 specifically in adult spiral ganglion neurons. Finally, frizzled 9 protein was found in the growth cones of adult spiral ganglion neurons that were regenerating neurites in culture. We conclude from our results that adult spiral ganglion neurons are poised to respond to neurite damage, owing to the constitutive expression of a large and diverse collection of guidance receptors. Wnt signaling, in particular, emerges as a candidate pathway for guiding neurite outgrowth towards a cochlear implant after sensorineural hearing loss. To determine which potential guidance receptors were present in the adult cochlea and whether any of them were chronically up- or downregulated after damage, we conducted a microarray hybridization screen with modioli from three unexposed and noise-exposed mice each. The noise treatment was administered at four weeks of age, and the modioli were harvested at eight weeks of age. The pre-processed hybridization signals (GSM321743-8) were further analyzed with Bioconductor tools (release 2.1; www.bioconductor.org) in R software (version 2.6.1; http://www.r-project.org) according to the procedures outlined in Gentleman et al.

Myc oncoproteins directly regulate transcription by binding to target genes, yet this only explains a fraction of the genes affected by Myc. mRNA turnover is controlled via AU-binding proteins (AUBPs) that recognize AU-rich elements (AREs) found within many transcripts. Analyses of precancerous and malignant Myc-expressing B cells revealed that Myc regulates hundreds of ARE-containing (ARED) genes and select AUBPs. Notably, Myc directly suppresses transcription of Tristetraprolin (TTP/ZFP36), an mRNA-destabilizing AUBP, and this circuit is also operational during B lymphopoiesis and IL7 signaling. Importantly, TTP suppression is a hallmark of cancers with MYC involvement, and restoring TTP impairs Myc-induced lymphomagenesis and abolishes maintenance of the malignant state. Further, there is a selection for TTP loss in malignancy; thus, TTP functions as a tumor suppressor. Finally, Myc/TTP-directed control of select cancer-associated ARED genes is disabled during lymphomagenesis. Thus, Myc targets AUBPs to regulate ARED genes that control tumorigenesis. Wild type, Eu-TTP-1, precancerous Em-Myc and precancerous Em-Myc;Eu-TTP-1 transgenic bone marrow B cells (from 4-6 week old littermates; 94% C57BL/6) were investigated.

Transcriptional analysis of identified DRG subpopulations.Cell-type specific intrinsic programs instruct neuronal subpopulations before target-derived factors influence later neuronal maturation. Retrograde neurotrophin signaling controls neuronal survival and maturation of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons, but how these potent signaling pathways intersect with transcriptional programs established at earlier developmental stages remains poorly understood. Here we determine the consequences of genetic alternation of NT3 signaling on genome-wide transcription programs in proprioceptors, an important sensory neuron subpopulation involved in motor reflex behavior. We find that the expression of many proprioceptor-enriched genes is dramatically altered by genetic NT3 elimination, independent of survival-related activities. Combinatorial analysis of gene expression profiles with proprioceptors isolated from mice expressing surplus muscular NT3 identifies an anticorrelated gene set with transcriptional levels scaled in opposite directions. Voluntary running experiments in adult mice further demonstrate the maintenance of transcriptional adjustability of genes expressed by DRG neurons, pointing to life-long gene expression plasticity in sensory neurons. We combined a mouse line expressing GFP under the control of the TrkC promoter (BAC transgene approach) with various NT3 signaling mutants in order to identify the transcriptional changes in identified subpopulations of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons.

We conducted two experiments with the hope of defining some of the molecular interactors for four separate behaviours: sugar feeding, locomotor activity in a novel field, and acoustic startle reflex, and prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex, which have been linked to prefrontal cortex dopaminergic function or as predictors of sensorimotor gating in diseases such as schizophrenia. Rats with high and low response phenotypes were selected to determine the differences between these two extremes of behaviour. From our analyses, transcripts of Homer1, a neuronal scaffolding protein which interacts with group1 metabotropic glutamate receptors, were found to be significantly correlated with array data in both experiments, and with behaviour data across three separate tests in the second experiment, indicating that this gene's transcripts and probably downstream protein interactions have a significant correlation with behaviour phenotype in the inbred Lewis rat. Future areas of pursuit for this data should involve modification of the expression of Homer1 in an isolated fashion to determine a pharmacological threshold for differences in behaviour.Keywords: Phenotype-Association Study.

To address the biological role of Unr, we inactivated the unr gene by homologous recombination in mice and embryonic stem (ES) cells. Embryos deficient for Unr die at mid-gestation, and the main phenotypic defects observed, growth deficiency and absence of neural tube closure, suggest a role of Unr in the balance proliferation/differentiation during early development. Here, we report that in Unr-null ES cell cultures, we observed a greater proportion of partially differentiated colonies, together with dispersed, refractile cells with stellate morphology, reminiscent of primitive endoderm (PrE) cells. DNA microarray, immunostaining, and RNA analyses revealed that Unr-null ES cells express a set of PrE markers, including the GATA6 transcription factor, a key inducer of PrE. Although Unr-deficient cells did not downregulate the pluripotency regulators Oct4, Nanog and Sox2, they grew more slowly than the wild-type lines, and their clonogenicity was lower. Silencing of Unr by RNA interference in ES E14 (129 genetic background) resulted in similar phenotypic and molecular changes as those observed in unr-/- ES cells (C57Bl/6 background). Finally, we show that ectopic expression of Unr in unr-/- ES cells partially reverses the endoderm-specific gene expression and the differentiation phenotype.We propose that Unr prevents the differentiation of ES cells into PrE, by controlling the stability of GATA6 mRNAs, since the decay of GATA6 mRNAs is increased in the absence of Unr. In summary, these results indicate that an essential function of Unr is to stabilize ES cells in a pluripotent state by repressing PrE gene expression.Keywords: Transcriptome analysis of wild-type and unr K.O. ES cells. We have compared the transcriptome of wild-type and unr-/- ES cells. Heterozygous unr+/- mice were intercrossed, and unr+/+ and unr-/- ES cell lines were established from individual blastocysts. Total RNA were prepared from unr+/+ and unr-/- cells, either under growing conditions, or two or 24 hours after gamma-irradiation. Two or three replicates per condition.",

We have identified a replication-independent histone variant, Hist2h2be (referred to herein as H2be), which is expressed exclusively by olfactory chemosensory neurons. Levels of H2BE are heterogeneous among olfactory neurons, but stereotyped according to the identity of the co-expressed olfactory receptor (OR). Gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that changes in H2be expression affect olfactory function and OR representation in the adult olfactory epithelium. We show that H2BE expression is reduced by sensory activity and that it promotes neuronal cell death, such that inactive olfactory neurons display higher levels of the variant and shorter life spans. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of H2BE differ from those of the canonical H2B, consistent with a role for H2BE in altering transcription. We propose a physiological function for H2be in modulating olfactory neuron population dynamics to adapt the OR repertoire to the environment.The objective of generating this dataset was to analyze the effects of the ectopic over-expression of H2be (expressed from an Omp-promoter-driven transgene and tagged with a FLAG epitope) on gene expression in the main olfactory epithelium of 5-week old mice. This dataset compares gene expression in wild type and H2be-GF main olfactory epithelium (MOE) samples.

Esophageal involvement in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) is common, but tissue-specific pathological mechanisms are poorly understood. Fibrosis in the esophagus is thought to disrupt smooth muscle function and lead to esophageal dilatation, but autopsy studies demonstrate esophageal smooth muscle atrophy and the absence of fibrosis in the majority of SSc cases. Molecular characterization of SSc esophageal pathology is lacking. Herein, we perform a detailed characterization of SSc esophageal histopathology and molecular signatures at the level of gene expression. Esophageal biopsies were prospectively obtained during esophagogastroduodenoscopy in 16 consecutive SSc patients and 7 subjects without SSc. Upper and lower esophageal biopsies were evaluated for histopathology and gene expression. Individual patient's upper and lower esophageal biopsies showed nearly identical patterns of gene expression. Similar to skin, inflammatory and proliferative gene expression signatures were identified suggesting that molecular subsets are a universal feature of SSc end-target organ pathology. The inflammatory signature was present in biopsies without high numbers of infiltrating lymphocytes. Molecular classification of esophageal biopsies was independent of SSc skin subtype, serum autoantibodies and esophagitis. Proliferative and inflammatory molecular gene expression subsets in tissues from patients with SSc may be a conserved, reproducible component of SSc pathogenesis. The inflammatory signature is observed in biopsies that lack large inflammatory infiltrates suggesting that immune activation is a major driver of SSc esophageal pathogenesis. Gene expression was measured in upper and lower esophageal biopsies from 16 patients with and 7 subjects without SSc.",

The thymus is primarily responsible for generating naive, self-tolerant T cells from hematopoietic precursors. Thymic epithelial cells (TECs) together with other stromal cells create a specialized microenvironment which orchestrates the major selection processes for T cell development. Thymic function progressively deteriorates as part of the aging process, with a dramatic loss in TECs and T cell production, and this ultimately constrains the host immune repertoire.We have previously demonstrated the role of sex steroids in thymic involution in male mice, with surgical castration of middle-aged (9-12 month) male mice resulting in thymus regeneration, peaking around day 28. We have also demonstrated phenotypic alterations in TEC subsets within one week following castration that may contribute to this transient thymus regeneration effect.In this study, we aimed to examine genetic alterations in TEC and non-TEC stromal cell subsets (predominantly fibroblasts and endothelial cells) during age-related thymic involution (5-6 week old young adults compared to 9-12 month middle aged); and genetic changes in TEC and non-TEC at several timepoints following castration, to identify factors that may be involved in thymus regeneration.

Several recent papers reported that unbalanced expression of CK2 subunits is sufficient to drive epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a process involved in cancer invasion and metastasis. Herein, through transcriptomic and miRNA analysis together with comparison of cellular properties between wild type and CK2b-knock-down MCF10A cells, we show that down-regulation of CK2b subunit in mammary epithelial cells induces the acquisition of stem cell-like properties associated with CD44high/CD24low antigenic phenotype and the ability to grow under anchorage-independent conditions. These data demonstrate that a CK2b level establishes a critical cell fate threshold in the control of epithelial cell plasticity.

Paget's disease of bone (PDB) is a chronic focal skeletal disorder that affects 2-3% of the population over the age of 60. PDB is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with genetic heterogeneity. SQSTM1/p62 UBA domain mutation (p62P392L) is widely identified in PDB and has been shown to increase osteoclastogenesis. Further, environmental factors such as paramyxovirus are implicated in PDB and MVNP has been shown to induce Pagetic phenotype in osteoclasts. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying p62P392L and MVNP stimulation of osteoclast differentiation in PDB are unclear. We therefore determined p62P392L regulated gene expression profiling during osteoclast differentiation.We identified 9.7% genes were upregulated (> 4-fold) in p62P392L transduced cells. P62P392L mutant increased Integrin b3 (185 fold), integrin b5 (26 fold), IL-1a (11 fold), IL-6R (8 fold), CXCL-2 (7.5 fold), CXCL-3 (5 fold) compared to p62WT transduced cells. Furthermore, bone marrow mononuclear cells derived from patients with PDB showed high levels of SIRPb1 mRNA expression compared to normal subjects. Thus, p62P392L mutant regulated gene expression profiling during osteoclast differentiation provides new insights into molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets to control elevated osteoclast activity in PDB. Total RNA isolated from normal human bone marrow mononuclear cells transduced with p62EV, p62WT, p62P392L retroviral expression vectors and stimulated with M-CSF and RANKL for 48 h were subjected to Agilent microarray (~26,000 genes) analysis.

Although recent studies support regenerative potential based on cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), it remains unclear what cues regulate CPC fate. Using 2- and 3D-culture models, we demonstrate that the two most abundantly expressed matrix proteins in the heart, laminin and fibronectin, have opposite roles in CPC fate decision. CPCs on fibronectin showed predominantly nuclear localization of the transcriptional co-activator YAP and maintained proliferation. In contrast, seeding on laminin induced cytosolic retention and degradation of YAP and altered gene expression, which preceded decreased proliferation and enhanced lineage commitment. RNA-sequencing identified Plk2 as candidate target gene of YAP. Plk2 expression depended on YAP stability, was rapidly downregulated on laminin, and its regulation was sufficient to rescue and/or mimic the CPC response to laminin and fibronectin, respectively. These findings propose a novel role of Plk2 and identify an early molecular mechanism in matrix-instructed CPC fate with potential implications for therapeutic cardiac regeneration.

Our current understanding of the pathogenesis of T1D arose in large part from studies using the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Of concern, therapeutic interventions shown to significantly dampen or even reverse disease in mouse models have not successfully translated into interventions in human T1D. The present study addresses this disconnect in research translation by directly analyzing human donor islets from individuals with T1D, aiming to provide insight into disease mechanisms and identify potential target pathways for therapeutic intervention. We obtained human islets from a young individual with short-duration T1D, an older individual with long-duration T1D and three non-diabetic donors, and performed unbiased functional genomic analysis by high depth RNA sequencing on these unique cases. This analysis identified several inflammatory pathways upregulated in short-duration disease, which surprisingly included many components of innate immunity. Subsequent manipulation of one of these pathways/factors in NOD mice resulted in a significant reduction in diabetes progression when inhibition occurred early in disease progression. Taken together our data demonstrates that the direct analysis of human islets is essential for identifying relevant and promising novel targets for translation into effective therapeutic interventions for human T1D. 5 human islets of Langerrhans preparations. 3 in normo-glycemic individual, one individual with a long duration type 1 diabetes and one individual with short duration type 1 diabetes.",

Despite considerable progress understanding genes that affect the HDL particle, its function, and cholesterol content, genes identified to date explain only a small percentage of the genetic variation. We used N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis in mice to discover novel genes that affect HDL cholesterol levels. Two mutant lines (Hlb218 and Hlb320) with low HDL cholesterol levels were established. Causal mutations in these lines were mapped using linkage analysis: For line Hlb218 within a 12 Mbp region on Chr 10; and for line Hlb320 within a 17 Mbp region on Chr 7. High-throughput sequencing of Hlb218 liver RNA identified a mutation in Pla2g12b. The transition of G to A leads to a cysteine to tyrosine change and most likely causes a loss of a disulfide bridge. Microarray analysis of Hlb320 liver RNA showed a 7-fold downregulation of Hpn; sequencing identified a mutation in the 3' splice site of exon 8. Northern blot confirmed lower mRNA expression level in Hlb320 and did not show a difference in splicing, suggesting that the mutation only affects the splicing rate. In addition to affecting HDL cholesterol, the mutated genes also lead to reduction in serum non-HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Despite low HDL cholesterol levels, the mice from both mutant lines show similar atherosclerotic lesion sizes compared to control mice. These new mutant mouse models are valuable tools to further study the role of these genes, their affect on HDL cholesterol levels, and metabolism. Mutant mice were generated as part of The Jackson Laboratory's Heart, Lung, Blood, and Sleep Disorder Mutagenesis Program by treating male C57BL/6J (B6) mice with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). Third generation (G3) mice were phenotyped to ensure capture of both dominant and recessive mutations. Two unique G3 animals with low HDL cholesterol levels were then used to establish new inbred lines (Hlb218 and Hlb320) by mating them with B6 mice and intercrossing the offspring with low HDL cholesterol for 7 generations. Livers from 3 Hlb218, 3 Hlb320 males, and 6 B6 male controls were obtained for gene expression analysis. The samples were randomized over Illumina Mouse-6 Expression 1.1 BeadChips .",

Renal biopsy is the gold standard among the diagnostic tools, but it is invasive and not suitable for all patients. Therefore, new reliable and non-invasive biomarkers for ccRCC detection are required. Secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs), containing RNA molecules that can be transferred between cells, seems to be a general characteristic of malignant transformation. Consistently, cancer-derived EVs are enriched in the blood, urine and various malignant effusions of cancer patients. Therefore, urinary samples can be a non-invasive approach for discovering diagnostic biomarkers.Methods: We enrolled 33 clear-cell RCC (ccRCC) patients and 22 healthy subjects (HS), age and sex-matched, for urine collection and extracellular vesicles isolation by differential centrifugation. Transcriptional profiles of urinary EVs from 12 patients with ccRCC and 11 HS were generated using the Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 BeadChip oligonucleotide arrays. Microarray analysis led to the identification of RNA that were then validated using RT-qPCR.Results: We showed for the first time that urinary exosomal shuttle RNA (esRNA) was significantly different in ccRCC patients compared to HS and we identified three EVs esRNA involved in the tumor biology that are potentially suitable as non-invasive biomarkers. GSTA1, CEBPA and PCBD1 RNA levels decreased in urinary EVs of patients compared to HS. After 1 month post-operation, the levels of RNA increased to reach the normal level.Conclusions: This study suggests, for the first time, the potential use of the RNA content of urinary EVs to provide a non-invasive first step to diagnose the ccRCC.

    "text": "Sustained L-type Calcium Channel Blockade Alters Gene Regulation in the Adult Mouse Ventricle. Objective: L-type calcium channels (LTCC) homeostatically regulate calcium on a beat by beat basis, but also provide Ca that over long time scales may contribute to transcriptional regulation. We previously showed that sustained LTCC blockade (CCB) elicits LTCC remodeling in ventricular cardiac myocytes (CM). Here we hypothesize that sustained CCB has broad effects on the expression of genes involved in calcium handling. Methods and Results: Therefore, we subjected adult mice to sustained CCB for 24 hours and performed gene expression profiling. In comparison to vehicle-only control animals, 231 genes were up-regulated, and 111 genes were down-regulated by sustained LTCC blockade (p <0.01). Gene ontology analysis suggested that the CaMKIIdelta signaling pathway was up-regulated in these cells. Unexpectedly, phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) at threonine17 (Thr17), an index of CaMKIIdelta activity, was not changed by sustained CCB; however, the degree of phosphorylation of the neighboring PLN-Ser16 substrate site for PKA was significantly reduced by sustained CCB compared to control. Gene expression profiling suggested no change in PKA, but it showed that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) mRNA increased, and immunoblots demonstrated that PP2Ac-alpha protein was significantly increased by sustained CCB. Consistent with elevated PP2Ac-alpha protein expression LTCC exhibited decreased phosphorylation of the C-terminal Ser1928 PKA substrate site. Conclusions: We conclude that sustained CCB elicits a spectrum of transcriptional events, including compensatory up-regulation of LTCC and PP2Ac-alpha. Although this study is restricted to mouse, these results suggest the new hypothesis that clinically-relevant sustained LTCC blockade in humans results in changes in gene regulation in the heart. Keywords: L-type calcium channel, calcium channel blockade, verapamil. Female and male ICR mice (12-14 weeks age) weighing between 25 and 30 grams were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine mixture ( i.p.) allowing the subcutaneous implantation of miniosmotic pumps (Alzet, model 2001). The pumps were filled with either verapamil or vehicle (0.02% ascorbic acid). Control animals carried mini-pumps with vehicle and control animals were investigated in parallel with each set of experimental animals. Mini pumps delivered verapamil at 3.6 mg/kg/day for 24 (RNA)-48 (protein) hours. After treatment animals were anesthetized and weighed. Hearts were excised, rinsed, blotted dry, weighed, and then frozen on dry ice and the stored at -80oC until studied. Animals were anesthetized and euthanized according to animal protocols approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. This investigation conforms with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication NO. 85-23, revised 1996).

Major risk factors for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) are formula feeding and prematurity, however, their pathogenic mechanisms are unknown.

Formula feeding led to increased intestinal hypoxia in pups at postnatal day 1(P1) and P5, but not in more mature pups at P9. Accordingly, blood flow in the intestinal microvasculature increased after formula feeding only in P9 pups. mRNA profiling revealed that regulators of arginine/nitric oxide synthesis are at higher levels in endothelial cells of the intestine of P9 than P1 pups. Importantly, arginine supplementation increased intestinal microvasculature blood flow, and prevented NEC, whereas an arginine antagonist exacerbated NEC.

    "text": "Norrin-dependent gene expression in cerebellar granule neuron progenitors. Medulloblastoma (MB), a tumor of the cerebellum, is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. One third of all human MB exhibits a gene expression signature of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. Hedgehog (Hh) pathway inhibitors have shown efficacy in clinical trials for MB, however, tumors develop resistance to these compounds, highlighting the need to identify additional therapeutic targets for treatment. We have identified a role for Norrin signaling in tumor initiation in the Patched (Ptch) mouse model of MB. Norrin is a secreted factor that functions as an atypical Wnt by binding to the Frizzled4 (Fzd4) receptor on endothelial cells to activate canonical beta-catenin-mediated Wnt signaling pathway. In the cerebellum, activation of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling is required for the establishment and maintenance of the blood brain barrier (BBB). We have identified a role for Norrin signaling in the stroma as a potent tumor inhibitory signal. Inactivation of Norrin in Ptch+/- mice significantly shortens latency and increases MB incidence. This phenotype is associated with an increased frequency of pre-tumor lesions and their conversion to malignancy. In this context, loss of Norrin signalling in endothelial cells is associated with an accelerated transition to a pro-tumor stroma characterized by vascular permeability, inflammation and angiogenic remodelling. Accordingly, loss of Ndp significantly alters the stromal gene expression signature of established Ptch MB. Ptch+/- mice were maintained on a C57Bl/6 background. NdpKO mice, generated by disruption of the Ndp locus by a lacZ-containing cassette were obtained from Lexicon Pharmaceuticals (Junge et al., 2009) and maintained by interbreeding on a mixed background. Ndp is an X-linked gene and Ndp+/- females were crossed with Ptch+/- males, to generate male (Ndp-/y;Ptch+/-) NdpKO;Ptch+/- compound mutants. All compound mutants were compared to single Ptch+/- or wild-type controls from the same breeding cohort to ensure matched backgrounds. Granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) were isolated from postnatal day 6 (P6) cerebella of WT, Ptch+/- and Ndp-/y;Ptch+/- mice. MB tumors were dissected from the cerebella of symptomatic Ptch and Ndp-/y;Ptch+/- mice.

The cardinal clinical features of Parkinson's disease (PD) (rigidity, rest tremor, bradykinesia, and postural instability) result from selective loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. More specifically, dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are much more susceptible to damage than the adjacent dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). This dichotomy is not only seen in human Parkinsons disease, but also in many animal models of PD, including administration of the mitochondrial toxin rotenone to rats, which replicates many of the behavioral and neuropathological features of PD. The factors underlying this selective vulnerability are unknown, but could be related to differences in neuronal circuitry, differences in glial support, or intrinsic differences between the neuronal populations of the two regions. Elucidation of these factors may lead to a greater understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of Parkinson's disease.We will determine gene expression profiles of untreated rat SNc and VTA dopaminergic neurons using laser capture microscopy to obtain region-specific neuronal mRNA.There are intrinsic differences in gene expression between dopaminergic neurons in the rat SNc and VTA that result in greater susceptibility of SNc neurons to degeneration in experimental parkinsonism. These differences may be related to dopamine metabolism, oxidative metabolism and stress, protein aggregation, or other unforseen pathways.We will compare gene expression profiles between SNc and VTA dopaminergic neurons in normal rats. No treatment or time points will be studied in this experiment. Animals will be anesthetized, sacrificed by decapitation, and brains frozen on dry ice. Frozen sections will be collected onto glass microscope slides and rapidly immunostained for tyrosine hydroxylase to identify dopaminergic neurons. SNc and VTA neurons (approx. 200 per sample) will be isolated using laser capture microscopy. Total RNA will be extracted and poly-A RNA will be amplified using a modified Eberwine protocol. aRNA will be sent to the centers for labeling and hybridization to Affymetrix rat U34A arrays. We have confirmed with the center that our aRNA protocol is compatible with the centers amplification protocols; in fact, it is essentially identical. We will be providing a two-round amplification product to the center for labeling and hybridization. We recognize that using RNA after three rounds of amplification may decrease sensitivity for low copy number transcripts, but favor this approach versus pooling our samples (which are inherently paired) at this point. We have discussed this point in detail with the center. SNc and VTA samples from eight animals (16 samples total) will be provided to mitigate differences specific to individual animals. With the assisatnce of the center, paired t-tests will be used to determine differential expression between the two regions. Permutational t-test analysis and/or Benjamini and Hochberg analysis of expression ratios will be used to protect against multiple comparisons. Selected differentially expressed genes will be validated on separate tissue samples using quantitative RT-PCR or in situ hybridization.WARNING: These data are identical to those represented in GEO Series GSE1157.",

The oncogenic transcription factor (c-)Myc is overexpressed in a variety of cancers including subtypes of B cell lymphoma. Here we study long noncoding (lnc)RNAs regulated by Myc, arguing that these lncRNAs may be involved in the very strong effect of Myc on cell proliferation. Using multiple in vitro models and taking into account the kinetics of the response to Myc as well as Myc binding sites we defined two Myc-induced and four Myc-repressed lncRNA candidates. Expression levels of the top Myc-induced lncRNA KTN1-AS1 are low in normal B cell subsets and strongly increased in multiple Myc-positive lymphoma cell lines. In addition, primary lymphoma cases stratified by high or low Myc expression show the expected KTN1-AS1 expression differences. Knockdown of KTN1-AS1 severely impaired the cell growth of multiple Burkitt lymphoma cell lines. Gene expression analysis showed that KTN1-AS1 knockdown affects >300 genes genome wide with a strong enrichment of Myc-target genes involved in metabolism and biosynthesis. In line with this finding, KTN1-AS1 depletion in B cell lymphoma cells caused a substantial decrease of Myc transcript and protein. Thus, our data indicates that KTN1-AS1 overexpression in lymphoma may reinforce high Myc expression at the transcriptional level to activate gene expression programs supporting the high metabolic rate present in lymphoma cells. In conclusion, we identified a novel positive feedback loop between c-Myc and KTN1-AS1 in B cell lymphoma cells. LncRNAs such as KTN1-AS1, that regulate important oncogenic factors in specific cell types, may open new ways to cancer therapy. Microarray gene expression analysis was performed in ST486 cells infected with 2 individual shRNAs targeting the lncRNA KTN1-AS1 or two non-targeting control shRNAs; samples were harvested at day 4 and day 6 post-infection.",

Myc oncoproteins directly regulate transcription by binding to target genes, yet this only explains a fraction of the genes affected by Myc. mRNA turnover is controlled via AU-binding proteins (AUBPs) that recognize AU-rich elements (AREs) found within many transcripts. Analyses of precancerous and malignant Myc-expressing B cells revealed that Myc regulates hundreds of ARE-containing (ARED) genes and select AUBPs. Notably, Myc directly suppresses transcription of Tristetraprolin (TTP/ZFP36), an mRNA-destabilizing AUBP, and this circuit is also operational during B lymphopoiesis and IL7 signaling. Importantly, TTP suppression is a hallmark of cancers with MYC involvement, and restoring TTP impairs Myc-induced lymphomagenesis and abolishes maintenance of the malignant state. Further, there is a selection for TTP loss in malignancy; thus, TTP functions as a tumor suppressor. Finally, Myc/TTP-directed control of select cancer-associated ARED genes is disabled during lymphomagenesis. Thus, Myc targets AUBPs to regulate ARED genes that control tumorigenesis. Ex vivo Em-Myc lymphoma cells were infected with MSCV-I-dsRed2 (RFP) and FACS sorted for dsRed2+ cells. These cells were then infected with MSCV-TTP-I-GFP and FACS sorted for GFP expression (TTP-GFP- or TTP-GFP+).

In mammalian cells, the catabolic activity of the dNTP triphosphohydrolase SAMHD1 sets the balance and the concentrations of the four dNTPs. Deficiency of SAMHD1 leads to unequally increased pools and marked dNTP imbalance. Although it is documented that imbalanced dNTP pool expansion increases mutation frequency in cancer cells, it is not known if the SAMHD1-induced dNTP imbalance favors accumulation of somatic mutations in non-transformed cells. Here we have investigated how fibroblasts isolated from Aicardi Goutieres Syndrome (AGS) patients with mutated SAMHD1 react to the constitutive pool imbalance characterized by a huge dGTP pool. We focused on the effects on dNTP pools, cell-cycle progression, dynamics and fidelity of DNA replication, efficiency of UV-induced DNA repair. AGS fibroblasts entered senescence prematurely or upregulated genes involved in G1/S transition and DNA replication. The normally growing AGS cells exhibited unchanged DNA replication dynamics and, when quiescent, faster rate of excision repair of UV-induced DNA damages than wildtype fibroblasts. To investigate if the lack of SAMHD1 affects DNA replication fidelity we compared de novo mutations in AGS and WT cells by exome next generation sequencing. Somatic variant analysis indicated a mutator phenotype suggesting that SAMHD1 is a caretaker gene whose deficiency is per se mutagenic promoting genome instability in non-transformed cells. This experiment was designed to understand if mutations on SAMHD1 gene interfere with gene expression. We used one primary cell line as control (WT) and four primary cell line carrying SAMHD1 mutantions (AGS patients).

To evaluate the potential of miR-137 in glioblastoma therapy, we conducted genome-wide target mapping in glioblastoma cells by measuring levels of associations between PABP and mRNAs in cells transfected with miR-137 mimics vs. controls via RIPSeq. Impact on mRNA levels was also measured by RNASeq.

    "text": "Induction of ERDNp63a via Tamoxifen in primary keratinocytes. Genome-wide identification of bona fide targets of transcription factors in mammalian cells is still a challenge. We present a novel integrated computational and experimental approach to identify direct targets of a transcription factor. This consists in measuring time-course (dynamic) gene expression profiles upon perturbation of the transcription factor under study, and in applying a novel reverse-engineering\" algorithm (TSNI) to rank genes according to their probability of being direct targets. Using primary keratinocytes as a model system, we identified novel transcriptional target genes of Trp63, a crucial regulator of skin development. TSNI-predicted Trp63 target genes were validated by Trp63 knockdown and by ChIP-chip to identify Trp63-bound regions in vivo. Our study revealed that short sampling times, in the order of minutes, are needed to capture the dynamics of gene expression in mammalian cells. We show that Trp63 transiently regulates a subset of its direct targets, thus highlighting the importance of considering temporal dynamics when identifying transcriptional targets. Using this approach, we uncovered a previously unsuspected transient regulation of the AP-1 complex by Trp63, through direct regulation of a subset of AP-1 components. The integrated experimental and computational approach described here is readily applicable to other transcription factors in mammalian systems and is complementary to genome-wide identification of transcription factor binding sites.Keywords: time course, p63, keratinocytes.

The number of elderly patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) is increasing worldwide, representing a serious burden for both the affected patients and the community. Previous studies have demonstrated that neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation is an effective treatment for SCI in young animals. Here we show that NSC transplantation is as effective in aged mice as it is in young mice, even though aged mice exhibit more severe neurological deficits after SCI. NSCs grafted into aged mice exhibited better survival than did those grafted into young mice. Furthermore, we show that the neurotrophic factor HGF plays a key role in the enhanced functional recovery after NSC transplantation observed in aged mice with SCI. The unexpected results of the present study suggest that NSC transplantation is a potential therapeutic modality for SCI, even in elderly patients.

Background & Aims: Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a rare primary hepatic cancer usually developed in non-cirrhotic livers of children and young adults with unknown etiology. Treatment is limited to surgical intervention. To date, molecular pathogenesis of FLC has been poorly characterized. Herein, we aim to provide an integrative genomic analysis from a large series of FLC patients. Methods: A clinically annotated cohort of 77 FLCs was analyzed through wholetranscriptome, SNP-array and whole-exome sequencing. Non-negative matrix factorization was performed for class discovery, and GSEA, NTP, IPA and immunohistochemistry for functional annotation. GISTIC algorithm identified chromosomal aberrations; Mutect and VarScan2, somatic mutations, and Random survival forest the prognostic signature, validated in an independent cohort. Results: Unsupervised gene expression clustering revealed 3 robust molecular classes: Proliferation-51%, enriched with liver cancer proliferation signatures and mTOR signaling activation, Inflammation-26%, with pro-inflammatory cytokines signatures, and Unannotated-23%, with non-liver-related cancer signatures. Neuroendocrine genes and cholangiocyte and hepatocyte histological markers were present in all classes. FLC showed few copy number variations, being the most frequent: focal amplification at 8q24.3(12.5%), and deletions at 19p13(28%) and 22q13.32(25%). DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript was observed in 79% of cases. FLC tumors had 32 damaging mutations on average, affecting uncommon genes in liver neoplasms (BRCA2, U2AF1). An 8-gene prognostic signature predicted survival in FLC patients. Conclusions: FLC genomic analysis reveals a unique molecular portrait characterized by uncommon damaging mutations and chromosomal aberrations, and a highly prevalent fusion protein. Three molecular classes, including Proliferation and Inflammation, define the biological behavior. Prognostic signature will allow better patient stratification.

Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer, and it results from ongoing errors in chromosome segregation during mitosis. While CIN is a major driver of tumor evolution, its role in metastasis has not been established. Here we show that CIN promotes metastasis by sustaining a tumor-cell autonomous inflammatory response to cytosolic DNA. Errors in chromosome segregation create a preponderance of micronuclei whose envelopes frequently rupture exposing their DNA content to the cytosol. This leads to the activation of the cGAS-STING cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway and downstream noncanonical NF-kB signaling. Genetic suppression of CIN significantly delays metastasis in transplantable tumor models, whereas inducing chromosome segregation errors promotes cellular invasion and metastasis in a STING-dependent manner. In contrast to primary tumors, human and mouse metastases strongly select for CIN, in part, due to its ability to enrich for metastasis-initiating mesenchymal subpopulations, offering an opportunity to target chromosome segregation errors for therapeutic benefit. To determine whether CIN is causally involved in metastasis, we devised a genetic approach to alter the rate of chromosome missegregation in transplantable tumor models of human TNBC (MDA-MB-231);cont: Control sample.

Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation-paired end diTag cloning and sequencing strategy, we mapped estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) binding sites in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We identified 1,234 high confidence binding clusters of which 94% are projected to be bona fide ERalpha binding regions. Only 5% of the mapped estrogen receptor binding sites are located within 5 kb upstream of the transcriptional start sites of adjacent genes, regions containing the proximal promoters, whereas vast majority of the sites are mapped to intronic or distal locations (>5 kb from 5' and 3' ends of adjacent transcript), suggesting transcriptional regulatory mechanisms over significant physical distances. Of all the identified sites, 71% harbored putative full estrogen response elements (EREs), 25% bore ERE half sites, and only 4% had no recognizable ERE sequences. Genes in the vicinity of ERalpha binding sites were enriched for regulation by estradiol in MCF-7 cells, and their expression profiles in patient samples segregate ERalpha-positive from ERalpha-negative breast tumors. The expression dynamics of the genes adjacent to ERalpha binding sites suggest a direct induction of gene expression through binding to ERE-like sequences, whereas transcriptional repression by ERalpha appears to be through indirect mechanisms. Our analysis also indicates a number of candidate transcription factor binding sites adjacent to occupied EREs at frequencies much greater than by chance, including the previously reported FOXA1 sites, and demonstrate the potential involvement of one such putative adjacent factor, Sp1, in the global regulation of ERalpha target genes. Unexpectedly, we found that only 22%-24% of the bona fide human ERalpha binding sites were overlapping conserved regions in whole genome vertebrate alignments, which suggest limited conservation of functional binding sites. Taken together, this genome-scale analysis suggests complex but definable rules governing ERalpha binding and gene regulation.Keywords: time course.

Triple negative cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer usually associated with poor outcome and lack of benefit from target therapy. A pathway analysis in a microarray study was performed using TNBC compared with non-triple negative breast cancer (non-TNBC). Overexpression of several Wnt pathway genes, such as frizzled homolog 7 (FZD7), Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) and transcription factor 7 (TCF7) has been observed in TNBC. Focus was given to the Wnt pathway receptor, FZD7. To validate its function, inhibition of FZD7 using FZD7shRNA was carried out. Notably decreased cell proliferation, suppressed invasiveness and colony formation in triple negative MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 cells were observed. Mechanism study indicated that these effects occurred through silencing the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, as evidenced by loss of nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and decreased transcriptional activity of TCF7.

Cell fate can be directly converted between differentiated cells by lineage reprogramming, thus generating multiple cell types across developmental lineages. However, lineage reprogramming is hindered by incomplete cell-fate conversion with residual initial cell identity and partial functions compared with the native counterparts. Here, we develop a high-fidelity reprogramming strategy, by mimicking the natural cell-fate changing route, thus permitting the production of functionally competent human hepatocytes from another cell type. We first converted fibroblasts into plastic hepatic progenitor-like cells (hHPLCs) and chemically induced them into mature hepatocytes. The molecular identity of human induced hepatocytes (hiHeps) are suggested a terminally differentiated state, resembling primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). Functionally, hiHeps were competent to replace PHHs for equivalent drug-metabolizing activities, toxicity prediction and hepatitis B virus infection. Remarkably, the stably robust expansion of hHPLCs allowed large-scale generation of mature hepatocytes. Our results demonstrate the necessity of taking a reprogramming step for plastic progenitors for efficient cell-fate conversion. This strategy is promising for the generation of other mature human cell types.

However, realizing the full potential of iPS cells requires robust, precise and safe strategies for their genetic modification. Safe human iPS cell engineering is especially needed for therapeutic applications, as stem cell-based therapies that rely on randomly integrated transgenes pose oncogenic risks. Here we describe a strategy to genetically modify iPS cells from patients with beta-thalassemia in a potentially clinically relevant manner. Our approach is based on the identification and selection of \"safe harbor\" sites for transgene expression in the human genome. We show that thalassemia patient iPS cell clones harboring a transgene can be isolated and screened according to chromosomal position. We next demonstrate that iPS cell clones that meet our \"safe harbor\" criteria resist silencing and allow for therapeutic levels of beta-globin expression upon erythroid differentiation without perturbation of neighboring gene expression. Combined bioinformatics and functional analyses thus provide a robust and dependable approach for achieving desirable levels of transgene expression from selected chromosomal loci. This approach may be broadly applicable to introducing therapeutic or suicide genes into patient specific iPS cells for use in cell therapy. iPS cell clones were derived from beta-thalassemia patients.

A multi-omic approach in a clinical experimental study identified circulating biomarkers reflecting glucocorticoid exposure.Background: Endogenous glucocorticoids (GC) are mechanistically linked to common diseases and are important as drugs in the treatment of many disorders. There is no marker that can measure and quantify GC action. Our aim was to identify circulating biomarkers of GC action using a clinical experimental study. Methods: In a randomized, crossover, single-blind trial, subjects with primary adrenal insufficiency received intravenous hydrocortisone infusion in a circadian pattern (physiological GC exposure) or isotonic saline (GC withdrawal) over 22 hours. Samples were collected at 7 AM (end of infusion). Integrated multi-omic analysis was used because of the complexity in GC action and the low number of subjects. The transcriptome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and adipose tissue, plasma miRNAomic, and serum metabolomics were compared between the interventions. Replication of the plasma miRNA findings was performed in three independent studies. Results: During GC withdrawal, overnight urinary cortisol and cortisone excretion were undetectable. Correlation and hypernetwork analyses identified a transcriptomic profile derived from PBMCs and adipose tissue predictive of GC exposure, and a multi-omic cluster predictive of GC exposure. From the circulating 'omic data, decreased expression of plasma miR-122-5p was associated with increased GC exposure. This finding was reproduced in three independent studies. Conclusion: We developed a human experimental model for physiological GC exposure and withdrawal. The integrated multi-omic data identified circulating miRNAs and metabolites associated with GC-responsive genes. In independent studies, miR-122-5p was shown to be associated with GC exposure.

We compared the transcriptomes of patient-derived tumors regressing on MAPKi therapy against MAPKi-induced temporal transcriptomic states in human melanoma cell lines or murine melanoma in immune-competent mice. Despite heterogeneous dynamics of clinical tumor regression, residual tumors displayed highly recurrent transcriptomic alterations and enriched processes, which were also observed in MAPKi-selected cell lines (implying tumor cell-intrinsic reprogramming) or in bulk mouse tumors (and the CD45-negative or -positive fractions,, implying tumor cell-intrinsic or stromal/immune alterations, respectively). Tumor cell-intrinsic reprogramming attenuated MAPK-dependency, while enhancing mesenchymal, angiogenic and IFN-inflammatory features and growth/survival dependence on multi-RTKs and PD-L2. In the immune compartment, PD-L2 upregulation in CD11c+ immunocytes drove the loss of T-cell inflammation and promoted BRAFi resistance. Thus, residual melanoma early on MAPKi therapy already displays potentially exploitable adaptive transcriptomic, epigenomic, immune-regulomic alterations.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major risk factor for cardioembolic stroke. Anticoagulant drugs are effective in preventing AF-related stroke. However, the high frequency of anticoagulant-associated major bleeding is a major concern particularly when antiplatelet treatment is simultaneously administered. Here, microarray analysis in peripheral blood cells in eight patients with AF and stroke and eight AF subjects without stroke identified a stroke related gene expression pattern. HSPA1B, which encodes for heat-shock protein 70 kDa (Hsp70), was the most differentially expressed gene. This gene was downregulated in stroke subjects, a finding confirmed further in an independent AF cohort of 200 individuals. Hsp70 knock-out (KO) mice subjected to different thrombotic challenges developed thrombosis significantly earlier than their wild-type (WT) counterparts.In WT mice, Hsp70 inducers (TRC051384, or tubastatin A) delayed thrombus formation. Remarkably, Hsp70 inducers did not increase the bleeding risk even when aspirin was concomitantly administered. Hsp70 induction was associated with an increased vascular thrombomodulin expression, higher circulating levels of activated protein C (APC) upon thrombotic stimulus and increased protection against endothelial apoptosis. Thus, Hsp70 induction is a novel approach to delay thrombus formation with minimal bleeding risk, being especially promising in situations where there is a major bleeding hazard.

In this study we use synthetic biotinylated miRNA to pull down endogenous targets of miR-182. We identified over 1000 genes as potential targets of miR-182, most of which have a known function in pathways underlying tumour biology. Specifically, functional enrichment analysis identified components of both the DNA damage response pathway and cell cycle to be highly represented in this target cohort. Experimental validation confirmed that miR-182 mediated disruption of the homologous recombination (HR) pathway is a consequence of its ability to target multiple components in that pathway. Although there is a strong enrichment for the cell cycle ontology, we do not see a direct biological effect as a consequence of miR-182 over expression. We highlight targets which could be responsible for miR-182 mediated disruption of other biological processes attributed in the literature so far.

Purpose: There is substantial heterogeneity within the human papillomavirus (HPV) positive head and neck cancer (HNC) tumors that predispose them to different outcomes, however this subgroup is poorly characterized due to various historical reasons. Experimental Design: we perform unsupervised gene expression clustering on well-annotated HPV(+) HNC samples from two cohorts ( 84 total primary tumors), as well as 18 HPV(-) HNCs, to discover subtypes, and begin to characterize the differences between the subtypes in terms of their HPV characteristics, pathway activity, whole-genome somatic copy number variations and mutation frequencies. Results: We identified two distinctive HPV(+) subtypes by unsupervised clustering. Membership in the HPV(+) subtypes correlates with genic viral integration status, E2/E4/E5 expression levels and the ratio of spliced to full length HPV oncogene E6. The subtypes also show differences in copy number alterations, in particular the loss of chr16q and gain of chr3q, PIK3CA mutation, and in the expression of genes involved in several biological processes related to cancer, including immune response, oxidation-reduction process, and keratinocyte and mesenchymal differentiation. Conclusion: Our characterization of two subtypes of HPV(+) tumors provides valuable molecular level information in relation to the alternative paths to tumor development and to that of HPV(-) HNCs. Together, these results will shed light on stratifications of the HPV(+) HNCs and will help to guide personalized care for HPV(+) HNC patients. 36 head and neck primary tumors (18 HPV+ and 18 HPV-) and their matched blood samples were collected and genotyped by Illumina OmniExpress SNP array.

Many microRNAs (miRNAs) exist alongside abundant miRNA isoforms (isomiRs), most of which arise from post-maturation sequence modifications, such as 3' uridylation. However, the ways in which these sequence modifications affect miRNA function remain poorly understood. Here, using human miR-27a in cell lines as a model, we have discovered that a nonfunctional target site unable to base pair extensively with the miRNA seed sequence can regain function when an upstream adenosine is able to base-pair with a post-transcriptionally added uridine in the miR-27a tail. This Tail-U-Mediated Repression (TUMR) is abolished in cells lacking the uridylation enzymes TUT4 and TUT7, indicating that uridylation alters miRNA function by modulating target recognition. We identified a set of non-canonical targets in human cells that are specifically regulated by uridylated miR-27a. We provide evidence that TUMR expands the targets of other endogenous miRNAs.

Although p62 was proposed to participate in formation of benign adenomas in autophagy-deficient livers, its role in HCC initiation was not explored.

Accumulating evidences indicate that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), circular RNA (circRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) play crucial roles in the progression of virus infection. Here, we identified differential lncRNA/miRNA/circRNA and mRNA expression profiles of HTNV-infected human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) compared with mock-infected HUVECs by whole transcriptome sequencing. Subsequently, comprehensive bioinformatics analyses established miRNA-mRNA co-expression, protein-protein interaction and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks in miRNA-lncRNA-circRNA-mRNA regulatory axis. The trans or cis regulatory roles of identified RNAs on HTNV infection were ascertained by RNA interference and key ceRNA relationships were verified by dual-luciferase reporter experiments. Moreover, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that dysregulated RNAs were mostly related to antiviral innate immune response. In conclusion, our findings firstly revealed that circRNAs and ceRNA network were involved in regulating HTNV infection, and also confirmed several key lncRNAs and miRNAs which had vital effects on HTNV infection.

Cerebral palsy is primarily an upper motor neuron disease that results in a spectrum of progressive movement disorders. Secondary to the neurological lesion, muscles from patients with cerebral palsy are often spastic and form debilitating contractures that limit range of motion and joint function. With no genetic component, the pathology of skeletal muscle in cerebral palsy is a response to aberrant neurological input in ways that are not fully understood. This study was designed to gain further understanding of the skeletal muscle response to cerebral palsy using microarrays and correlating the transcriptional data with functional measures. Hamstring biopsies from gracilis and semitendinosus muscles were obtained from a cohort of patients with cerebral palsy (n=10) and typically developing patients (n=10) undergoing surgery. Affymetrix HG-U133A 2.0 chips (n=40) were used and expression data was verified for 6 transcripts using quantitative real-time PCR, as well as for two genes not on the microarray. Chips were clustered based on their expression and those from patients with cerebral palsy clustered separately. Significant genes were determined conservatively based on the overlap of three summarization algorithms (n=1,398). Significantly altered genes were analyzed for over-representation among gene ontologies, transcription factors, pathways, microRNA and muscle specific networks. These results centered on an increase in extracellular matrix expression in cerebral palsy as well as a decrease in metabolism and ubiquitin ligase activity. The increase in extracellular matrix products was correlated with mechanical measures demonstrating the importance in disability. These data lay a framework for further studies and novel therapies. Skeletal muscle biopsies from both the gracilis and semitendinosus were obtained during surgery for 20 pediatric subjects for affymetrix microarray analysis. We obtained a group of 10 patients undergoing medial hamstring lengthening in the cerebral palsy group and 10 patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with hamstring autograft in the control group.

Down-regulation (DR) of PREP1 (aka PKNOX1) tumor suppressor induces H2Ax foci in human fibroblasts. Here we have analyzed the effect of PREP1 DR on DNA replication using cell cycle analysis, Repliseq, DNA combing, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and immunofluorescence (IF). In human cells, PREP1 DR similarly affects both the rate of DNA replication and the progression of cells through the S phase. Genome wide, PREP1 DR induces late to early DNA replication shifts in normally late-replicated genomic regions amounting to 25% of the genome, in addition to unscheduled origins firing. A concomitant strong increase of unidirectional replication forks explains the appearance of DNA damage foci. The DNA target of PREP1 DR is the Lamin Associated DNA, in agreement with the simultaneous decrease of Lamin B1. Therefore PREP1 is a novel regulator of replication timing and Lamin B1 level, which ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data indicate as independent from its transcriptional activity. This activity must constitute the basis for its tumor suppression function. RNA-seq of HeLa cells transfected with siPrep1 and siLuc (control cells).",

Philadelphia-like B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) is characterized by distinct genetic alterations and inferior prognosis in children and younger adults. The purpose of this study was the genetic and clinical characterization of Ph-like ALL in adults. Among 207 adult B-cell precursor ALL patients, 26 (13%) were classified as Ph-like using Affymetrix microarrays. The incidence of this subtype was 25% among 105 B-cell precursor ALL patients negative for BCR-ABL1 and MLL-translocations (B-other). All patients with IgH-CRLF2 translocation (38% vs 0%; p=0.002) or mutations in JAK2 (44% vs. 0%; p<0.001) were exclusively found in the Ph-like subgroup. Clinical and outcome analyses were restricted to patients treated within GMALL trials 06/99 and 07/03 (n=107). The complete remission (CR) rate after induction was 100% for Ph-like (n=19) and B-other patients (n=40). After induction, significantly fewer Ph-like patients reached molecular CR (33% vs 79%; p=0.01). At 5 years, the Ph-like ALL subgroup had a lower probability of continuous CR (24% vs 62%; p<0.001) and overall survival (22% vs 64%; p=0.006) compared to B-other ALL patients. Subsequent analysis led to a clinically applicable algorithm identifying this patient subset with a specificity of 100%. Our study is the first to demonstrate that the profile of genetic events in adult Ph-like ALL resembles pediatric Ph-like ALL and differs from B-other ALL. The Ph-like phenotype associates with inferior outcomes in intensively treated adult ALL patients. Ph-like adult ALL should be recognized as a distinct, high-risk entity and further research on improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches is needed.

Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare and inadequately characterized disease. The aim of the present study was to characterize MBC tumors transcriptionally, to classify them into comprehensive subgroups, and to compare them with female breast cancer (FBC). Methods: Sixty-six clinicopathologically well-annotated fresh frozen MBC tumors were analyzed using Illumina Human HT-12 bead arrays, and a tissue microarray with 220 MBC tumors was constructed for validation using immunohistochemistry. Two external gene expression datasets were used for comparison purposes; 37 MBCs and 359 FBCs. Results: Using an unsupervised approach, we classified the MBC tumors into two subgroups, luminal M1 and luminal M2, respectively, with differences in tumor biological features and outcome, and which differed from the intrinsic subgroups described in FBC. The two subgroups were recapitulated in the external MBCs dataset. Luminal M2 tumors were characterized by high expression of immune response genes and genes associated with estrogen receptor (ER) signaling. Luminal M1 tumors, on the other hand, despite being ER positive by immunohistochemistry showed a lower correlation to genes associated with ER signaling and displayed a more aggressive phenotype and worse prognosis. Validation of two of the most differentially expressed genes, class 1 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and the metabolizing gene N-acetyltransferase-1 (NAT1), respectively, revealed significantly better survival associated with high expression of both markers (HLA, hazard ratio (HR) 3.6, P=0.002; NAT1, HR 2.5, P=0.033). Importantly, NAT1 remained significant in a multivariate analysis (HR 2.8, P=0.040) and may thus be a novel prognostic marker in MBC. Conclusions: We have detected two unique and stable subgroups of MBC with differences in tumor biological features and outcome. They differ from the widely acknowledged intrinsic subgroups of FBC. As such they may constitute two novel subgroups of breast cancer, occurring exclusively in men, and which may consequently require novel treatment approaches. Finally, we identified NAT1 as a possible prognostic biomarker for MBC, as suggested by NAT1 positivity corresponding to better outcome. . Total RNA was extracted from 66 male breast cancer samples and were hybridized to Human HT-12 v3.0 Expression BeadChips in three batches at the SCIBLU Genomics Center at Lund University.

To test if inhibition of CTGF would alter the course of cardiac remodeling and preserve cardiac function in the protein kinase Ce (PKCe) mouse model of DCM. Transgenic mice expressing constitutively active PKCe in cardiomyocytes develop cardiac dysfunction that was evident by 3 months of age, and that progressed to heart failure, cardiac fibrosis, and increased mortality. Beginning at 3 months of age, mice were treated with an antibody to CTGF (FG-3149) or non-immune IgG control antibody for an additional 3 months. CTGF inhibition significantly improved left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function in PKCe mice, and slowed the progression of LV dilatation. Using gene arrays and quantitative PCR, the expression of many genes associated with tissue remodeling were elevated in PKCe mice, but significantly decreased by CTGF inhibition, however total collagen deposition was not attenuated. The observation of significantly improved LV function by CTGF inhibition in PKCe mice suggests that CTGF inhibition may benefit patients with DCM.

Purpose: 5A3+/del mice, which have a heterozygous germ line deletion of a 2-Mb interval of chromosome band 5A3 syntenic to a commonly deleted segment of human 7q22, exhibit hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) abnormalities that may contribute to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) pathogenesis. These defects are cell autonomous. The goal of this study is to compare transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) data obtained from HSC and multipotent progenitors (MPP) isolated from 5A3+/del mice and their wildtype littermates, in order to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways that may contribute to the phenotype.Methods: Total RNA was isolated from CD150hi-HSC, CD150lo-HSC and CD150neg-MPP from wildtype and 5A3+/del mice. 10ng of total RNA was converted into double-stranded cDNA using the Ovation RNA Amplification System V2 (NuGen, CA), and the amplified cDNA products were then used to generate RNA-seq libraries using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 reagents (Illumina, CA) with 10 PCR amplification cycles. Library quality and quantity were assessed by the Agilent DNA1000 Chip (Agilent, CA) and qPCR (Kappa Biosystems Inc, MA). 10 pM of each library was sequenced using Illumina SBS chemistry at 2 x 100 bp reads on the HiSeq2000 (Illumina(r), CA). The RNA-Seq paired-end reads were mapped to the mouse mm9 genome using an in-house mapping and quality assessment pipeline. The expression of each gene was estimated by the mean coverage of the highest-covered coding exon. Genes with low expression level (<10) across all samples were filtered out, followed by quantile normalization. Differential expression analysis was performed using limma with estimation of false-discovery rate. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was used to assess pathway enrichment.Results:Transcriptome (RNA-Seq) and Taqman quantitative real-time PCR analyses revealed a ~50% reduction in the expression of multiple genes and of the long intergenic non-coding RNA 503142E22Rik within the 5A3 interval in mutant HSC and MPP. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of the RNA-Seq data from 5A3+/del HSCs further demonstrated reduced expression of multiple gene sets related to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) that are similarly down-regulated in the early stages of human therapy-induced MDS and AML.Conclusions: Our study revealed that genes involved in OXPHOS were down-regulated in 5A3+/del HSC, and this finding provided novel insights into the impact of chromosome 7 deletions on the pathogenesis of MDS. Transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) data of HSC and MPP isolated from 5A3+/del mice and their wildtype littermates were generated by sequencing, in quintuplicate, using Illumina SBS chemistry at 2 x 100 bp reads on the HiSeq2000 (Illumina(r), CA).",

Deletions within the human IKZF1 gene, which encodes Ikaros, a zinc finger transcription factor critical for lymphopoiesis, appear to be the most prominent recurring lesion in human BCR-ABL1+ (Ph+) B-ALL. Furthermore, IKZF1 mutations correlate with poor prognosis of progenitor B-ALL, further strengthening the notion that IKZF1 is a critical tumor suppressor gene in human B-lineage malignancies. To better understand the relationship between Ikzf1 mutations, BCR-ABL, and B-lineage leukemia, we examined the effect of two newly generated Ikzf1 germline mutation on BCR-ABL-induced proliferation and leukemogenesis in vitro and in vivo. We recently showed that deletion of either the exon encoding the first or the fourth DNA-binding zinc finger of Ikaros (IkZnF1-/- and IkZnF4-/-) led to distinct defects in lymphoid development and tumor suppression with de-regulation of distinct subsets of genes, providing a powerful tool for elucidation of Ikaros target genes and mechanism of function. Importantly, IkZnF4-/- had lost Ikaros tumor suppression function, while not abolishing B-cell development. Retroviral expression of BCR-ABL1 p185 in bone marrow cells from the two Ikzf1 mutant strains demonstrated that loss of ZnF4 resulted in expansion of progenitor B cells, with enhanced proliferation in vitro and a less mature cell surface B-cell phenotype in comparison to transduced wild-type bone marrow. Furthermore, in an in vivo model of BCR-ABL+ B-ALL, leukemias generated in the IkZnF4-/- background were more aggressive than those observed in a wild-type background, with cell phenotype corresponding to the in vitro cell cultures. Genome wide high throughput expression analysis (RNA-Seq) revealed a distinct subset of deregulated genes in the IkZnF4-/- BCR-ABL+ in vitro cell cultures, and molecular analysis demonstrated that this in vitro system is amendable for functional studies. These results establish a mouse model for studying the role of Ikzf1 mutations in B-ALL, and for understanding how BCR-ABL collaborates with Ikzf1 mutations to generate aggressive B-ALL. RNA-Seq from BCR-ABL+ transformed cells at day 14 of in vitro cell culture comparing wt, Ikaros-ZnF1-/- mutant and Ikaros-ZnF4-/- mutant (2 biological replicates).",

Identification of the molecular characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and elucidation of its crosstalk with tumor cells may therefore be crucial for improving our understanding of the processes implicated in cancer progression, identifying potential therapeutic targets, and uncovering stromal gene expression signatures that may predict clinical outcome. A key issue to resolve, therefore, is whether the stromal response to tumor growth is largely a generic phenomenon, irrespective of the tumor type, or whether the response reflects tumor-specific properties. To address similarity or distinction of stromal gene expression changes during cancer progression, oligonucleotide-based Affymetrix microarray technology was used to compare the transcriptomes of laser-microdissected stromal cells derived from invasive human breast and prostate carcinoma. Invasive breast and prostate cancer-associated stroma was observed to display distinct transcriptomes, with a limited number of shared genes. Interestingly, both breast and prostate tumor-specific dysregulated stromal genes were observed to cluster breast and prostate cancer patients, respectively, into two distinct groups with statistically different clinical outcomes. By contrast, a gene signature that was common to the reactive stroma of both tumor types did not have survival predictive value. Univariate Cox analysis identified genes whose expression level was most strongly associated with patient survival. Taken together, these observations suggest that the tumor microenvironment displays distinct features according to the tumor type that provides survival-predictive value. 6 samples of stroma surrounding invasive breast primary tumors; 6 matched samples of normal stroma. 6 samples of stroma surrounding invasive prostate primary tumors; 6 matched samples of normal stroma.",

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, thus understanding molecular changes associated with EOC progression could lead to the identification of essential therapeutic targets. Glycosylation is a post-translational modification (PTM) that participates in major pathophysiology events, including tumorigenesis. Aberrant mucin-type or O-glycosylation in cancer is frequently attributed to altered expression of different N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GalNAc-Ts). We have previously identified the N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3 (GALNT3) gene as a potential EOC oncogene, possibly implicated in aberrant O-glycosylation in EOC cells. Literature reports are suggestive for genetic and functional redundancy between different GalNAc-Ts, and our previous data were indicative for an induction of the GALNT6 expression upon GALNT3 suppression in EOC cells. Here we show that GALNT3 gene knockout (KO) in the A2780s EOC cells leads to strong GALNT6 upregulation. Moreover, A2780s cell migration, invasion, proliferation and cell cycle analysis were significantly reduced in double GALNT3/T6 gene KO cells compared to single GALNT3 gene KO. Furthermore, MUC1 expression was downregulated in both GALNT3 KO and GALNT3/6 KO, with a more prominent decrease observed in the double KO clone. In vivo studies supported the observed functional redundancy imposed by GALNT6, as animals injected with double GALNT3/T6 KO EOC cell clones displayed a significant increase in survival rates compared to those injected with the control and the GALNT3 KO clones. Collectively our data strongly suggest for possible functional redundancy of the two GalNAc-Ts (GALNT3 and T6) in EOC, with the perspective to use both of these genes as EOC markers and/or therapeutic targets. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of GALNT3 and GALNT6 genes action in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), we employed the Agilent Whole Human Genome microarrays, containing ~ 44,000 genes to identify global gene expression changes upon GALNT3 suppression and double GALNT3/6 suppression in A2780s EOC cells. We compared the gene expression of the selected CRISPR-Cas9-mediated GALNT3 -knockout clones (GAL3 KO-1 and GAL3 KO-2) and the double gene Knockout GALNT3/6 clones (GAL3/6 KO-1 and GAL3/6 KO-2) against the corresponding control (C) clones .",

Epigenetic changes, particularly DNA methylation aberrations have been implicated in acquired resistance to platinum in ovarian cancer. A multi-institutional randomized clinical trial compared a regimen of a DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) inhibitor guadecitabine and carboplatin to physician's choice chemotherapy for patients with recurrent platinum resistant ovarian cancer. Tumor biopsies or malignant ascites were collected at day 1 of cycle 1 (pre-guadecitabine) and after two cycles of treatment (post-decitabine). The goal of the current study was to analyze guadecitabine-induced DNA methylation and gene expression changes and correlate pretreatment levels with clinical outcomes. Epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HM450) and RNA sequencing revealed extensive methylation and gene expression changes induced by guadecitabine in ovarian tumors. Ninety-four gene promoters were significantly hypomethylated after treatment with guadecitabine and 949 genes were differentially expressed in pre vs. post-treatment tumors. Pathways associated with immune reactivation and DNA repair were significantly altered by guadecitabine treatment. Expression levels of 1155 genes involved in 25 networks on day 1 of cycle 1 correlated with progression free survival. Increased expression of selected genes (e.g. DOK2, miR193a) silenced through promoter methylation restored platinum sensitivity in ovarian cancer cells. Together, these results support that guadecitabine altered DNA methylation and expression of genes and gene networks correlate with re-sensitization to carboplatin in ovarian cancer patients. 93 samples are analyzed, including tumor samples collected from patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer before treated by guadecitabine and after treated by guadecitabine.",

Regulatory regions in genomes like enhancers and promoters differ in their extent of methylation of histone H3 at lysine-4 (H3K4), but it is largely unknown how the different methylation states are specified and controlled. Here, we show that the Kdm5c/Jarid1c/SMCX member of the Kdm5 family of H3K4 demethylases can be recruited to both enhancer and promoter elements in embryonic stem cells and neuronal progenitor cells via gene-specific transcription factors. Knockdown of Kdm5c deregulates transcription via local increases in H3K4me3. Our data show that restricting H3K4me3 modification at core promoters dampens transcription, but Kdm5c is required at enhancers for their full activity. Remarkably, an impaired enhancer function activates the intrinsic promoter activity of Kdm5c-bound distal elements. Our results demonstrate that the Kdm5c demethylase plays a crucial and dynamic role in the functional discrimination between enhancers and core promoters.

Among those exhibiting reproducible behavior, clones CN-10 (negative control), 3-44 (shRNA3) and 4-18 (shRNA4) were selected for further analysis. Pdrg1 expression analyzed by RT-qPCR was reduced by 50% and 70% in 3-44 and 4-18 clones, respectively, as compared to CN-10.

Acquisition and maintenance of vascular smooth muscle fate is essential for the morphogenesis and function of the circulatory system. Loss of contractile properties or changes in the identity of vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMC) can result in structural alterations associated with aneurysms and vascular wall calcifications. Here we report that maturation of sclerotome-derived vSMC is dependent on a transcriptional switch between mouse embryonic days 13 and 14.5. At this time point, Jag1-mediated repression of sclerotome transcription factors Pax1, scleraxis and Sox9 is necessary to fully enable vSMC maturation. Specifically, Notch signaling in vSMC antagonizes sclerotome and cartilage transcription factors, and promotes upregulation of contractile genes. In the absence of Jag1, vSMC acquire a chondrocytic transcriptional repertoire that can lead to ossification of the vascular wall. Importantly, our findings suggest that sustained Notch signaling is essential throughout vSMC life to maintain contractile function, prevent vSMC reprogramming and promote vascular wall integrity. mRNA profile of vascular Smooth Muscle Cells, isolated from the descending aorta of Immorto mouse, treated or not with gamma-secretase inhibitor was generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate.",

Glucose transporters are the first and rate-limiting step for cellular glucose usage, which is often exacerbated in tumour cells enabling their growth and proliferation. Although inhibiting glucose metabolism in lung tumours could become an efficient treatment strategy, whether and which glucose transporter(s) should be targeted remains unclear because of their possible functional redundancy, and because other nutrients or transporter-independent metabolic processes including autophagy and macropinocytosis can fuel tumour cell growth in certain contexts. Here we show that glucose transporter Glut1 gene deletion in tumour cells does not impact tumour initiation and only slightly delays progression in a genetically-engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. Using 13C-glucose tracing with correlated nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) and electron microscopy, we report the presence of multiple lamellar body-like organelles produced by tumour cells. Glucose-derived biomass accumulates in these organelles, and this accumulation is decreased in Glut1-deficient tumour cells. Ex vivo, tumour cell glycolysis is impaired in absence of Glut1 except in case of strong expression of another glucose transporter, Glut3. We show that Glut3 is dispensable for Glut1 wild-type tumour development. In contrast, their combined deletion diminishes tumour growth and prevents the appearance of big lesions. Our results demonstrate the requirement for two glucose transporters in lung adenocarcinoma; dual blockade could reach therapeutic responses not achieved by individual targeting.

The RNA-seq data revealed a significant decrease in mesoderm (one of the major source of vascular SMCs) markers and increase in PrE markers in CHIR treated samples, while other lineage markers showed no significant expression, implying a diverging to PrE fate by Wnt activation. Subsequent hierarchical clustering analysis also showed that the gene expression profiles of cells derived from RA induction alone clustered with adult SMCs, while cells derived from RA/CHIR induction gradually clustered to XEN cells with differentiation and was very close to XEN cells at day 16, suggesting that RA/CHIR-induced ESCs differentiated into PrE lineage.

ABSTRACT: Furin is a proprotein convertase (PC) responsible for proteolytic activation of a wide array of precursor proteins within the secretory pathway. It maps to the PRC1 locus, a type 2 diabetes susceptibility locus, yet its specific role in pancreatic b cells is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the role of furin in glucose homeostasis. We show that furin is highly expressed in human islets, while PCs that potentially could provide redundancy are expressed at considerably lower levels. b cell-specific furin knockout (bfurKO) mice are glucose intolerant, due to smaller islets with lower insulin content and abnormal dense core secretory granule morphology. RNA expression analysis and differential proteomics on bfurKO islets revealed activation of Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4), which was mediated by mammalian target of rapamycin C1 (mTORC1). bfurKO cells show impaired cleavage of the accessory V-ATPase subunit Ac45, and by blocking this pump in b cells the mTORC1 pathway is activated. Furthermore, bfurKO cells show lack of insulin receptor cleavage and impaired response to insulin. Taken together, these results suggest a model of mTORC1-ATF4 hyperactivation in b cells lacking furin, which causes b cell dysfunction.METHOD: Data obtained for the b cell specific knockout (RIP-Cre+/- furin flox/flox) and control (furin flox/flox) samples were compared to investigate the effect of furin loss on the mRNA profile of islets. Although this method does not directly provide furin targets, the notion of differential gene expression might elucidate affected cellular processes, potentially leading to upstream furin substrates. Islets were isolated from male RIP-Cre+/- furin flox/flox and furin flox/flox mice for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Four biological replicates were used per genotype.",

Monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1) and acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac) are correlated with transcriptionally engaged enhancer elements, but the functional impact of these modifications on enhancer activity is not well understood. Here we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to separate catalytic activity-dependent and independent functions of Mll3 (Kmt2c) and Mll4 (Kmt2d, Mll2), the major enhancer H3K4 monomethyltransferases. Loss of Mll3/4 catalytic activity and H3K4me1 from enhancers causes partial depletion of H3K27ac, but surprisingly minor effects on enhancer Pol II binding, enhancer RNA (eRNA) transcription and gene expression. In contrast, loss of Mll3/4 proteins results in dramatic reduction of eRNA production, concomitant with impaired transcriptional elongation at adjacent promoters. Altogether our results suggest the major coactivator function of Mll3/4 is largely independent of H3K4me1 and instead linked to enhancer Pol II occupancy, eRNA transcription and long-range influence on elongation at target promoters.

Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTL) is an aggressive lymphoma cytogenetically characterized by isochromosome 7q [i(7)(q10)], of which the molecular consequences remain unknown. We report here results of an integrative genomic and transcriptomic (expression microarray and RNA-sequencing) study of six HSTL cases with i(7)(q10) and three cases with ring 7 [r(7)], a rare variant aberration. Using high resolution array CGH, we prove that HSTL is characterized by the common loss of a 34.88 Mb region at 7p22.1p14.1 (3506316-38406226 bp) and duplication/amplification of a 38.77 Mb region at 7q22.11q31.1 (86259620-124892276 bp). Our data indicate that i(7)(q10)/r(7)-associated loss of 7p22.1p14.1 is a critical event in the development of HSTL, while gain of 7q sequences drives progression of the disease and underlies its intrinsic chemoresistance. Loss of 7p22.1p14.1 does not target a postulated tumor suppressor gene but unexpectedly enhances the expression of CHN2 from the remaining 7p allele, resulting in dysregulation of a pathway involving RAC1 and NFATC2 with a cell proliferation response. Gain of 7q leads to increased expression of critical genes, including RUNDC3B, PPP1R9A and ABCB1, a known multidrug resistance gene. RNA-sequencing did not identify any additional recurrent mutations or fusion, suggesting that i(7)(q10) is the only driver event in this tumor. Our study confirms the previously described gene expression profile of HSTL and identifies a set of 24 genes, including three located on chromosome 7 (CHN2, ABCB1 and PPP1R9A), distinguishing HSTL from other malignancies. The fastq files of all samples were mapped to the reference human genome (assembly GRCh37.68). The mapping was performed allowing detection of insertions and deletions (indels).

    "text": "ERK5 kinase activity is dispensable for cellular immune response and proliferation. Unlike other members of the MAPK family, ERK5 contains a large C-terminal domain with transcriptional activation capability in addition to an N-terminal canonical kinase domain. Genetic deletion of ERK5 is embryonic lethal and tissue-restricted deletions have profound effects on erythroid development, cardiac function and neurogenesis. In addition, depletion of ERK5 is anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic. Small molecule inhibition of ERK5 has been shown to have promising activity in cell and animal models of inflammation and oncology. Here we report the synthesis and biological characterization of potent, selective ERK5 inhibitors. In contrast to both genetic depletion/deletion of ERK5 and inhibition with previously reported compounds, inhibition of the kinase with the most selective of the new inhibitors had no anti-inflammatory or anti-proliferative activity. The source of efficacy in previously reported ERK5 inhibitors is shown to be off-target activity on bromodomains (BRDs), conserved protein modules involved in recognition of acetyl-lysine residues during transcriptional processes. It is likely that phenotypes reported from genetic deletion or depletion of ERK5 arise from removal of a non-catalytic function of ERK5. The newly reported inhibitors should be useful in determining which of the many reported phenotypes are due to kinase activity, and delineate which can be pharmacologically targeted. Two cellular models with reported ERK5-regulated signaling were used: Pam3CSK4-stimulated HUVECs as a model of inflammation, and EGF-stimulated HeLa cells as an established cell model of ERK5 regulation. Cells were pre-incubated with DMSO vehicle, AX15836 (ERK5 inhibitor), AX15839 (dual ERK5/BRD inhibitor), or I-BET762 (BRD inhibitor), then stimulated with agonist.

Successful gene therapy for b-thalassemia requires optimal numbers of autologous gene-transduced hematopoietic progenitors stem cells (HPSC) with high repopulating capacity and mobilization is the optimal approach for achieving this goal. We performed a clinical study to investigate safety and efficacy of G-CSF+AMD3100 mobilization in four adult with b-thalassemia to reach a cell dose of >=8x106 CD34+cells/Kg and to characterize the CD34+cell populations mobilized before and after plerixafor administration. The procedure resulted well-tolerated in all patients. Three of the four patients reached the target cell dose or more in single-apheresis collections, even one patient where a significant dose reduction of G-CSF was imposed due to early hyperleukocytosis. A significant increase in the number of circulating CD34+ cells/ul (12.1+- 8.2 fold), and in the frequency of the more primitive CD34+/CD133+/CD38- cells (1.7+-0.7 fold) was unanimously observed after AMD3100 addiction. Intraindividual comparison of gene expression profile of CD34+ cells mobilized with G-CSF versus G-CSF+ AMD3100 highlighted a different expression pattern of genes involved in the processes of HSC/stroma adhesion, homing, cell motility and transcription regulation.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) causes a respiratory disease leading to death in 10% of the infected people. A mouse adapted SARS-CoV lacking the envelope (E) protein (rSARS-CoV-MA15-DE) is attenuated in vivo. To identify E protein domains and host responses that contribute to rSARS-CoV-MA15-DE attenuation, several mutants (rSARS-CoV-MA15-E*) containing point mutations or deletions in the amino-terminal or the carboxy-terminal regions of E protein, respectively, were generated. Amino acid substitutions in the amino terminus, or deletion of domains in the internal carboxy terminal region of E protein led to viral attenuation. Attenuated viruses induced minimal lung injury and limited neutrophil influx to the lungs but, interestingly, increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts in BALB/c mice. To analyze the host responses leading to rSARS-CoV-MA15-E* attenuation, the differential gene expression elicited by the native virus and the mutant ones in infected cells was analyzed. The expression levels of a large number of proinflammatory cytokines inducing lung injury was reduced in the lungs of rSARS-CoV-MA15-E* infected mice, whereas the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines were increased, both at the mRNA and protein levels. These results suggested that the reduction in lung inflammation together with a specific antiviral T cell response, contributed to rSARS-CoV-MA15-E* attenuation. Interestingly, the attenuated viruses completely protected mice against the challenge with the lethal parental virus, being promising vaccine candidates.

MVs released by cancer cells may incorporate biomolecules such as active lipids, proteins and RNA, which can be delivered and internalized by recipient cells potentially altering gene expression of receiving cells eventually impacting disease progression. In this study, we took advantage of a leukemia in vitro model to investigate MVs as vehicles of protein coding messages. Leukemic cell lines (K562, REH and SHI-1) carrying recurrent translocations were analyzed. In the leukemic cells these translocations are transcribed into oncogenic fusion transcripts. Here, using gene expression microarrays we monitored leukemic fusion transcripts as hallmarks of leukemic cells transcriptome to track mRNA transfer from parental cells to MVs. Transcriptome analysis of K562 cells and released MVs disclosed MVs as not just \"small scale cells\". In fact, a number of transcripts related to membrane activity, cell surface receptors and extracellular communication were enriched in the MVs pool. On the other hand, sets of transcripts related to the basal cellular functions and transcripts of the BCR-ABL oncogenic pathway downstream of the fusion protein were detected in MVs as well as in parental K562 cells. Moreover, through co-culture analyses uptake of leukemic MVs in receiving cells was confirmed and an MV-dosage dependent increase of target cell proliferation was demonstrated.Our study provides novel understanding of tumor-derived MVs as carrier of protein coding messages. For the first time a whole transcriptome gene expression analysis has been performed comparing K562 parental cells and released MVs, showing an enrichment of transcripts coding for oncogenic proteins and for proteins involved in key cellular pathways.

TGF-b is involved in various biological processes, including development, differentiation, growth regulation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In TGF-b/Smad signaling, receptor-activated Smad complexes activate or repress their target gene promoters. Smad cofactors are a group of Smad-binding proteins that promote recruitment of Smad complexes to these promoters. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), that behave as Smad cofactors have thus far not been identified. Here, we characterize a novel lncRNA EMT-associated lncRNA induced by TGF-b-1(ELIT-1). ELIT-1 was induced by TGF-b-stimulation via the TGF-b/Smad pathway in TGF-b-responsive cell lines. ELIT-1-depletion abrogated TGF-b-mediated EMT progression and expression of TGF-b target genes including Snail, a transcription factor critical for EMT. A positive correlation between high expression of ELIT-1 and poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma and gastric cancer patients suggests that ELIT-1 may be useful as a prognostic and therapeutic target. RIP assays revealed that ELIT-1 bound to Smad3, but not Smad2. In conjunction with Smad3, ELIT-1 enhanced Smad-responsive promoter activities by recruiting Smad3 to the promoters of its target genes including Snail, other TGF-b-target genes, and ELIT-1 itself. Collectively, these data show that ELIT-1 is a novel trans-acting lncRNA that forms a positive feedback loop to enhance TGF-b/Smad3 signaling and promote EMT progression.

    "text": "SETD5-coordinated chromatin reprogramming regulates adaptive resistance to targeted pancreatic cancer therapy. Oncogenic KRAS signaling is a hallmark of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a lethal malignancy with few treatment options. A major roadblock in deploying therapies targeting the KRAS-MAPK pathway is the rapid emergence of resistant cancer cells. However, molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive targeted therapy resistance in PDAC are poorly understood. Here we find SETD5 (SET domain containing 5) as a major epigenetic driver of PDAC resistance to MEK1/2 inhibition (MEKi). SETD5 is identified in a genetic screen of annotated methyltransferases that mediate MEKi toxicity in PDAC cells. SETD5 expression is induced upon PDAC cells and tumors acquring MEKi-resistance and SETD5 deletion restores vulnerability of refractory PDAC to MEKi therapy in mouse models and patient-derived xenografts (PDX). SETD5 lacks intrinsic histone methyltransferase activity and rather scaffolds a distinct corepressor complex that regulates HDAC3 and G9a catalytic behaviors to couple selective deacetylation with methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9). Gene silencing by the SETD5 complex regulates a network of known drug resistance pathways to reprogram cellular responses to MEKi, a resistance program disrupted by G9a and HDAC3 blockade. Combinatorial pharmacological targeting of MEK1/2, G9a, and HDAC3 results in sustained tumor growth inhibition in murine and human models of PDAC. Together, our work uncovers SETD5 as a master epigenetic regulator of acquired MAPK-pathway therapy resistance and suggests an efficacious clinical path for MEKi in PDAC. mRNA profiles of KPCR cells (n = 3) (sgControl + Trametinib 0.2uM, sgSETD5 + Trametinib 0.2uM, or DMSO + Trametinib 0.2uM, UNC0638 0.6 uM + RGFP966 0.6uM + Trametinib 0.2uM).",

This study was undertaken to identify how gene expression of the RT4 bladder papilloma cells respond to extracellular matrics (ECM) Matrigel. Gene expression profile of RT4 cells grown on Plastic was compared with expression profiles of RT4 cells grown on Matriges over 12 hours-9 days timecourse. Total 5881 hypervariable (HV) genes were found to vary significantly over the time points, indicating a response to matrix change. Correlational clustering showed these HV genes fell into distinct families, predominantly genes which became highly expressed on ECM. Another cluster show genes expressed at 12 hours after grown on Matrigel and third cluster show genes whose expression decreased below noise level on Matrigel. This indicate that processes responsible for cell adaptation to ECM happen within first 12 hours and the second cluster form last response of those active processes. Over 1-9 days of cell grows on Matrigel those genes are constantly expressed. Cell signaling and cellular growth and proliferation accounted for major functions for those genes. G-protein signaling, immune response and NF-kB signaling accounted for most dramatically affected canonical pathways. Genes sharing similar ontologies also share several overrepresented transcription regulatory elements confirmed by independent experiment on Panomics platform.Thus, rapid response for ECM orchestrated by several transcription factors was observed. Identified canonical pathways indicate possible targets for manipulating cell phenotype on ECM.Keywords: extracellular matrix, gene expression, RT4, Matrigel, microarray, time course. Three dimensional gel cultures with Matrigel were performed by layering 0.8 mls of ice cold Matrigel onto polyethylene terephthalate membranes of 6-well cell culture inserts (Falcon, Becton-Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Gels were solidified at 37o C. RT4 cells were trypsinized, brought up on 20 mls McCoys media with 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS). Cells were centrifuged then brought up in McCoys media with 10% FCS to a concentration of 500,000 cells/250ul. 250ul added on top of each solidified matrigel disc and 2mls of McCoys with 10% FCS layered underneath each culture insert.

Acquisition and maintenance of vascular smooth muscle fate is essential for the morphogenesis and function of the circulatory system. Loss of contractile properties or changes in the identity of vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMC) can result in structural alterations associated with aneurysms and vascular wall calcifications. Here we report that maturation of sclerotome-derived vSMC is dependent on a transcriptional switch between mouse embryonic days 13 and 14.5. At this time point, Jag1-mediated repression of sclerotome transcription factors Pax1, scleraxis and Sox9 is necessary to fully enable vSMC maturation. Specifically, Notch signaling in vSMC antagonizes sclerotome and cartilage transcription factors, and promotes upregulation of contractile genes. In the absence of Jag1, vSMC acquire a chondrocytic transcriptional repertoire that can lead to ossification of the vascular wall. Importantly, our findings suggest that sustained Notch signaling is essential throughout vSMC life to maintain contractile function, prevent vSMC reprogramming and promote vascular wall integrity. mRNA profile of vSMC from the descending aorta of 14.5 embryos Wild type (WT), SMC Jag1-heterozygous (HTZ) and SMC Jag1-null (KO) was generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate.",

Overexpression and/or amplification of the ErbB-2 oncogene, as well as inactivation of the tumor suppressor PTEN, are two important genetic events in human breast carcinogenesis. To address the biological impact of conditional inactivation of PTEN on ErbB-2-induced mammary tumorigenesis, we generated a novel transgenic mouse model that utilizes the MMTV promoter to directly couple expression of activated ErbB-2 and Cre recombinase to the same mammary epithelial cell (MMTV-NIC). Disruption of PTEN in the mammary epithelium of the MMTV-NIC model system dramatically accelerated the formation of multifocal and highly metastatic mammary tumors, which exhibit homogenous pathology. PTEN-deficient/NIC tumorigenesis was associated with an increase in angiogenesis. Moreover, inactivation of PTEN in the MMTV-NIC mouse model resulted in hyperactivation of the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. However, like the parental strain, tumors obtained from PTEN-deficient/NIC mice displayed histopathological and molecular features of the luminal-like subtype of breast cancer. Taken together, our findings provide important implications in understanding the molecular determinants of mammary tumorigenesis driven by PTEN deficiency and ErbB-2 activation, and could provide a valuable tool for testing the efficacy of therapeutic strategies that target these critical signalling pathways.

Microvascular endothelial cells (EC) are increasingly recognized as organ-specific gatekeepers of their microenvironment. Microvascular EC instruct neighboring cells in their organ-specific vascular niches by angiocrine factors that comprise secreted growth factors/angiokines, but also extracellular matrix molecules and transmembrane proteins. The molecular regulators, however, that drive organ-specific microvascular transcriptional programs and thereby regulate angiodiversity, are largely elusive. Opposite to continuous barrier-forming EC, liver sinusoids are a prime model of discontinuous, permeable micro-vessels. Here, we show that transcription factor GATA4 controls liver sinusoidal endothelial (LSEC) specification and function. LSEC-restricted deletion of GATA4 caused transformation of discontinuous liver sinusoids into continuous capillaries. Capillarization was characterized by ectopic basement membrane deposition and formation of an abundantly VE-Cadherin expressing continuous endothelium. Correspondingly, ectopic expression of GATA4 in cultured continuous EC mediated downregulation of continuous EC transcripts and upregulation of LSEC genes. Regarding angiocrine functions, the switch from discontinuous LSEC to continuous EC during embryogenesis caused liver hypoplasia, fibrosis, and impaired colonization by hematopoietic progenitor cells resulting in anemia and embryonic lethality. Thus, GATA4 acts as master regulator of hepatic microvascular specification and acquisition of organ-specific vascular competence indispensable for liver development. The data also establish an essential role of the hepatic microvasculature for embryonic hematopoiesis. bEnd3 cells were transduced with mouse Gata4 or empty vector for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.",

The TCFs - SAP-1, Elk-1 and Net - are Ets proteins that link SRF activity to Ras-ERK signalling. In contrast, the two MRTFs, MRTF-A and MRTF-B, link SRF activity to Rho-actin signalling. In this novel signalling pathway, the actin-binding MRTF RPEL domain acts as a G-actin sensor, controlling MRTF nuclear accumulation in response to signal-induced depletion of the G-actin pool.

EphA2 ligand-independent activity, controlled upon phosphorylation at S897 (p-EphA2S897), has been linked to metastasis in several malignancies. Here, we stablish a correlation between ES cells aggressiveness and p-EphA2S897. Moreover, stable overexpression of EphA2 in low EphA2 expression ES cells enhanced proliferation and migration, but not a nonphosphorylable mutant (S987A).

    "text": "Characterization of transcriptomes of human iPSC-derived retinal lineages. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells are two retinal cell types that are affected by the most prevalent retinal diseases leading to irreversible blindness, such as glaucoma affecting the former and age-related macular degeneration affecting the latter. One of the most promising approaches for the therapy of these diseases is via the autologous transplantation of RGC or RPE cells derived from the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This emphasizes the importance of detailed characterization and understanding of the mechanisms of differentiation of iPSCs into retinal lineages on the genome-wide scale. Such information can be used to identify novel crucial regulators of differentiation, optimisation of differentiation protocols to make them more efficient and safe, identification of novel specific biomarker signatures of differentiated cells. In this study, we performed the genome-wide transcriptome analysis of terminally differentiated RGC and RPE lineages, as well as intermediate retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) of optic vesicles (OVs) derived from the human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In our analysis we specifically focused on the classes of transcripts that encode regulators of gene expression, such as transcription factors, epigenetic factors, and components of signaling pathways. Total RNA was extracted from iPSCs, RPE cells and RGCs differentiated from the same iPSC cell line, as well as from optic vesicles (OVs), an intermediate stage of differentiation of iPSCs into RGCs. Thus, four RNA sample types were obtained for gene expression analysis. Two biological replicates were analyzed for each sample type.",

Alternative splicing contributes to gene expression dynamics in many tissues, yet its role in auditory development remains unclear. We performed whole exome sequencing in individuals with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and identified pathogenic mutations in Epithelial Splicing Regulatory Protein 1 (ESRP1). Patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells showed alternative splicing defects consistent with impaired ESRP1 function. To determine how mutations in ESRP1 cause hearing loss we evaluated Esrp1-/- mouse embryos and uncovered alterations in cochlear morphogenesis, auditory hair cell differentiation and cell fate specification. Transcriptome analysis revealed impaired expression and splicing of genes with essential roles in inner ear development and auditory function. In particular, aberrant splicing of Fgfr2 blocked stria vascularis formation due to erroneous ligand usage, which was corrected by reducing Fgf9 gene dosage. These findings implicate mutations in ESRP1 as a novel cause of SNHL and demonstrate the complex interplay between alternative splicing, inner ear development, and auditory function. 3 biological replicates of whole E16.5 cochlear epithelium from individual Esrp1+/+ (Control) and Esrp1-/- (E1-KO) embryos (2 cochlea pooled from each embryo) were analyzed by RNA-seq.",

UHRF1 is a major regulator of epigenetic mechanism and is overexpressed in various human malignancies. In this study, we examined the involvement of UHRF1 in aberrant DNA methylation in colorectal cancer (CRC). In CRC cells, transient UHRF1 knockdown rapidly induced DNA demethylation across entire genomic regions, including CpG islands, gene bodies and repetitive elements. Nonetheless, UHRF1 depletion only minimally reversed CpG island hypermethylation-associated gene silencing. However, the combination of UHRF1 depletion and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition synergistically reactivated the silenced genes and strongly suppressed CRC cell proliferation. Our results suggest that (i) maintenance of DNA methylation in CRC cells is highly dependent on UHRF1; (ii) UHRF1 depletion rapidly induces DNA demethylation, though it is insufficient to fully reactivate the silenced genes; and (iii) dual targeting of UHRF1 and HDAC may be an effective new therapeutic strategy. RKO cells were transfected with a control siRNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or siRNAs targeting UHRF1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated for 72 h.

Although the consequences of genotoxic injury include cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, cell survival responses after genotoxic injury can produce intrinsic death-resistance and contribute to the development of a transformed phenotype. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are integral components of key survival pathways, and are responsible for their inactivation, while PTP inhibition is are often associated with enhanced cell proliferation. Our aim was to elucidate signaling events that modulate cell survival after genotoxin exposure. Diploid human lung fibroblasts (HLF) were treated with Cr(VI) (as Na2CrO4), a well known human respiratory carcinogen that induces a wide spectrum of DNA damage, in the presence and absence of a broad-range PTP inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate. Notably, PTP inhibition abrogated Cr(VI)-induced clonogenic lethality. The enhanced survival of Cr(VI)-exposed cells after PTP inhibition was predominantly due to a bypass of cell cycle arrest and was not due to decreased Cr uptake as evidenced by unchanged Cr-DNA adduct burden. Additionally, the bypass of Cr-induced growth arrest by PTP inhibition, was accompanied by a decrease in Cr(VI)-induced expression of cell cycle inhibiting genes, and an increase in the Cr(VI)-induced expression of cell cycle promoting genes. Importantly, PTP inhibition resulted in an increase in forward mutations at the HPRT locus, supporting the hypothesis that PTP inhibition in the presence of DNA damage may lead to genomic instability, via bypass of cell cycle checkpoints.

The translocation t(7;12)(q36;p13) occurs in infants and very young children with AML and usually has a fatal prognosis. Whereas the transcription factor ETV6, located at chromosome 12p13, has largely been studied in different leukemia types, the influence of the translocation partner HB9 (chr. 7q36), is still unknown. This is particularly surprising as ectopic expression of HB9 is the only recurrent molecular hallmark of translocation t(7;12) AML. We investigated the influence of HB9 as a potential oncogene on cell proliferation and cell cycle in vitro, as well as on hematopoietic stem cell differentiation in vivo using murine and human model systems. We show, that HB9 induces premature senescence in human HT1080 and murine NIH3T3 cells, providing for the first time evidence for an oncogenic potential of HB9. Furthermore, HB9-transduced primary murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells underwent a profound differentiation arrest and accumulated at the megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitor stage, resulting in a premalignant myeloid cell population in vivo. Concomitantly, HB9 expression upregulates erythropoiesis-related genes in primary human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and enriches gene expression profiles for cell cycle and mitosis-related biological processes. In summary, the novel findings of HB9 dependent premature senescence and perturbed hematopoietic differentiation shed light on the oncogenic properties of HB9 in translocation t(7;12) AML and offer novel targets for therapeutic intervention.

Bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane was administered to male F344/N rats at 0, 200, 400, or 600 mg/kg by dermal exposure for up to 16 days. Heart toxicity occurred at day 2 of exposure in all three regions of the heart (atrium, ventricle, interventricular septum) and was characterized by myofiber vacuolation, necrosis, mononuclear-cell infiltration, and atrial thrombosis. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that the primary site of damage occured in the mitochondrion. Damaged mitochondria had disrupted cristae and loss of membrane structure, and distention of the myocardial sarcoplasmic reticulum. By day 5, even though daily dosing was continued, the heart toxic lesions begin to resolved. By day 16, even though BCEM treatment continued, the heart appeared normal.RNA was extracted from control and dosed rats at day 2 and day 5, and analyzed for gene change by PCR. Gene changes associated with promoting cell growth including up regulation of growth factors and cell adhesion molecules were up regulated. Temperature regulation was promoted by up regulation of uncoupling proteins. Genes controlling the action potential of the heart, including ion flow and G protein signals, were altered. Because mitochondria are damaged by BCEM exposure, preserving and restoring energy function to the heart is considered to be essential, and up regulation of components of the ATP synthase unit occurred by day 5.Significant gene changes included up regulation of transcription factors, growth factors, membrane bound G protein signals, and ion transport controls. Multiple gene changes in the heart may contribute to restoration of heart function after exposure to environmental cardiotoxins.Keywords: toxicity, recovery, cardiac, heart. Chemical and Animal exposures:Bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane (CAS No. 11-91-1; lot B004160277) (Karl Industries, Aurora, OH) (Fig, 1) was found to be 98.5% pure (Dunnick et al. 2004a; Dunnick et al. 2004b) . Solutions of BCEM were prepared in 95% ethanol for dosing by dermal administration daily to male F344 rats, excluding weekends, for two weeks plus two consecutive dosages before the last sacrifice on study-day 16, at which animals had received a total of 12 doses. Fur from the site of application was clipped weekly. Stock solutions prepared at concentrations of 0, 800, and 1200 mg/ml were stored in amber glass bottles at room temperature. The administrations were applied to the skin of the male rats at 0.5 ml/kg body to deliver doses of 0, 400, or 600 mg/kg body weight. All dose formulations were determined to be within +-10% of target concentrations. Approximately 45% of a dermal dose of CEM is adsorbed (NIEHS Contract NO1-ES-75407 2002).

Mutations in repulsive guidance molecule c (RGMc) / hemojuvelin (HJV) cause juvenile hemochromatosis, an aggravated iron overload disorder that presents early in life. Patients with juvenile hemochromatosis, and RGMc knockout mice, have diminished expression of the key iron-regulatory peptide, hepcidin. This suggests that RGMc plays a critical role in the regulation of iron homeostasis; however the mechanisms of RGMc actions are unknown. Recent studies have shown that RGMc directly binds to the growth factors, bone morphogenetic protein 2 and 6 (BMP2 and BMP6), and it is possible that this interaction regulates aspects of iron metabolism.We used microarrays to examine the effects of RGMc on BMP2- and BMP6-mediated gene expression. In our experimental model we treated Hep3B liver cells that had been serum starved for 16 hours as follows: (1) un-treated, (2) BMP2, (3) BMP2 + 10-fold molar excess of Noggin (a potent BMP2 inhibitor), (4) BMP2 + 20-fold molar excess of RGMc, (5) BMP6, (6) BMP6 + 10-fold molar excess of Noggin, (7) BMP6 + 20-fold molar excess of RGMc.

However, direct connections between TET-mediated DNA demethylation and transcriptional output are difficult to establish due to challenges of distinguishing global versus locus-specific effects. Here we show that TET1/2/3 triple knockout (TKO) human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) exhibit preferential hypermethylation at bivalent promoters without corresponding gene expression changes in undifferentiated hESCs. In the absence of the TET proteins, abnormal accumulation of DNMT3B at bivalent promoters results in hypermethylation and impaired gene activation upon differentiation. Broadly, the competitive balance between the TET proteins and de novo methyltransferases at bivalent promoters could facilitate rapid changes of their methylation state to either activate or silence transcription in a cell-lineage and gene dependent manner. For RNA-Sequencing total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, 74136) from HUES8 WT and TKO hESCs.",

    "text": "SCAF4 and SCAF8, Transcriptional Anti-Terminator Proteins (mNET-Seq). Accurate regulation of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) transcriptional termination is a prerequisite for correct gene expression. Here we describe a role for SCAF4 and SCAF8 as anti-terminators, suppressing the use of early, alternative polyadenylation sites (PASs). The SCAF4/8 proteins bind the hyper-phosphorylated RNAPII C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) modified on both Ser2 and Ser5, and are detected at early, alternative PASs. Concomitant knockout of human SCAF4 and SCAF8 results in altered PAS selection, leading to expression of truncated mRNAs and proteins lacking functional domains, and is cell-lethal. While SCAF4 and SCAF8 thus work redundantly to suppress early termination, they also have independent, non-essential functions. SCAF8 is a positive RNAPII elongation factor, whereas SCAF4 is required for correct termination at canonical transcription termination sites in the presence of SCAF8. Together, SCAF4 and SCAF8 coordinate the transition between elongation and termination, directing PAS selection to ensure correct RNAPII transcriptional termination in human cells. To study the function of SCAF4 and SCAF8 in human cells, we used CRISPR-Cas9 nickase technology to generate single and double knockouts (KOs) in HEK293 Flp-In TREX cells, which also contained a single copy of a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible SCAF4 or SCAF8 rescue construct, with the encoded GFP-tagged protein expressed at near-normal levels. All cell lines were maintained in the presence of Dox to ensure expression of the CRISPR-resistant rescue gene during and after KO cell line generation. Expression of the rescue protein reaches undetectable levels after 5 days growth in Dox-free media, resulting in effective single of double KOs. Due to the manner in which these cell lines were generated, a total of 12 cell types (6 different cell lines grown with or without Dox) were often analysed together. For example, SCAF4 SCAF8 double KOs were generated either by first knocking out SCAF4 and then SCAF8, or vice versa, and these different cell lines were in turn also derived from cell lines containing either a Dox-inducible SCAF4- or a SCAF8 rescue gene, giving rise to a total of 4 genotypically identical SCAF4 SCAF8 dKO cell lines. Moreover, a SCAF4 SCAF8 double KO that expresses a rescue gene (i.e. grown in the presence of doxycycline) is effectively a single KO; for example, a SCAF4 SCAF8 double KO expressing the SCAF4 rescue gene is genotypically and phenotypically a single SCAF8 KO cell line. For PAR-CLIP experiments, HEK293 Flp-In TREX cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged SCAF4 or SCAF8 were used for FLAG immunoprecipitations from RNA-protein crosslinked extracts.",

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is frequently diagnosed in patients with late-stage disease who are ineligible for curative surgical therapies. Furthermore, the majority of patients become resistant to sorafenib. Recently, computational methods for drug repurposing have shown great promise to accelerate the discovery of new uses for existing drugs. In order to identify novel drugs for use against sorafenib resistant (SR)-HCC, we employed a transcriptomics-based drug repurposing method termed connectivity mapping. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of available in vitro and in vivo gene signatures of (SR)-HCC, and generated our own in vitro model using the Huh7 HCC cell line. We compared coverage of SR-HCC gene signatures across seven patient-derived HCC gene expression datasets, and observed that patients harboring the Huh7 SR-HCC gene signature had significantly reduced survival. Utilizing the Huh7 SR-HCC gene signature, we applied connectivity mapping to drug-induced gene expression profiles (n= 3,740 drugs) in the HepG2 HCC cell line from the LINCS database in order to find drugs that could oppose sorafenib resistance. We validated the use of two non-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, dasatinib and fostamatinib, to reduce viability of sorafenib-resistant HCC cells and confirmed up-regulated activity of Src family kinases, the targets of dasatinib, in our SR-HCC models. We prospectively validated predicted gene expression changes in fostamatinib treated Huh7-SR via RNA-seq analysis. Gene expression profiles of Huh7-SR hepatocellular carcinoma cells resistant to sorafenib were generated by RNAseq (Illumina HiSeq 4000) following treatment with fostamatinib and vehicle control.",

The androgen-sensitive LNCaP line of prostate cancer cells is one of the most commonly used cells in oncological research. These include, but are not limited to, research into the influence of leptin (LEP) on prostate cancer. However, the results of studies on the effects of this cytokine on the proliferation and apoptosis of LNCaP cells are controversial. Therefore, we performed studies on the effects of high LEP concentration (1x10-6 M) on gene expression profile, change of selected signaling pathways, proliferation and apoptosis of LNCaP cells. RTCA (real-time cell analyzer) revealed inhibitory effect of LEP on cell proliferation, but lower LEP concentrations (10-8 and 10-10 M) did not affect cell division. Within 24 h LEP (10-6 M) increases expression of 297 genes and decreases expression of 119 genes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were subjected to functional annotation and clusterization using the DAVID bioinformatics toolsMost ontological groups are associated with proliferation and apoptosis (7 groups), immune response (6) and extracellular matrix (2). These results were confirmed by the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The leptin's effect on apoptosis stimulation was also confirmed using Pathview library. These results were also confirmed by qPCR method. The results of Western Blot analysis (exposure to LEP 10 min, 1, 2, 4 and 24h) suggest (after 24 h) decrease of p38 MAPK, p44-42 mitogen-activated protein kinase and Bcl-2 phosphorylated at threonine 56. Moreover, exposure of LNCaP cells to LEP significantly stimulates the secretion of matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7). Obtained results suggest activation of apoptotic processes in LNCaP cells cultured at high LEP concentration. At the same time, this activation is accompanied by inhibition of proliferation of the tested cells. LNCaP - the human prostate carcinoma cell line [LNCaP clone FGC (ATCC(r) CRL-1740DTM)] was purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Rockville, MD, USA). LNCaP cells were cultivated in the RPMI Medium 1640 (1X), supplemented with GlutaMAX, HEPES (all from Gibco, Life technologies, Carlsbad, California, USA) and antibiotics (Antibiotic/antimycotic Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO 63103, USA). Cells were grown in the 75 cm2 flask (NUNC EasyFlask with Nunclon surface, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37degC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The culture medium was changed every 2 days. When cells reached approximately 80% confluence (about 7-8 days of cultivation), they were subcultured into 6-well plates (Nunc, Thermo Fisher Scientific, approximately 343 000 cells per one well - 9.6 cm2), to determine the effect of LEP on LNCaP transcriptome modulation. The applied experimental protocol was as follows: during the first 48 h of cultivation, the cells grew in a standard medium mentioned above. For the next 24 h, the cells were grown in starvation medium (FBS free). Afterwards, the cells were cultivated for 48 h, in a starvation medium supplemented with LEP (Recombinant Human Leptin, PeproTech, Germany) at the following concentrations: 0 (control), 1x10-6 M.

The series of events that allows for the conversion of adherent epithelial cells into migratory cells is collectively known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is involved in triggering neural crest migration during development and in the pathogenesis of diseases, such as cancer metastasis. Whereas Erk signalling is known to be essential for EMT, its influence on the epigenetic and transcriptional programme underlying EMT is poorly understood. Here, using a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of H3K27ac mark and gene expression in primary mammary epithelial cells undergoing EMT, we found that Erk signalling is essential for the epigenetic reprogramming underlying hallmark gene expression and phenotypic changes of EMT. We found that the chemical inhibition of Erk signalling during EMT prevents loss and gain of H3K27ac mark at regulatory regions of epithelial and mesenchymal genes, respectively, and results in a transcriptome and epigenome closer to those of epithelial cells. Further computational analyses identified a distinct set of transcription factor motifs enriched at distal regulatory regions that are epigenetically remodelled by Erk signalling. Altogether, our study reveal an Erk-dependent epigenetic remodelling of distal regulatory elements that results in a gene expression programme that is essential for driving EMT. 1) After treatment of NMuMG cells with TGF-beta, three timepoints viz. 0hr, 4hr, 24hr were captured. To inhibit Erk pathway, Erk inhibitor is administered to NMuMG cells 30 min prior to TGF-beta treatment and captured at 4hr and 24hr timepoints. 2) For each timepoint captured, RNAseq and H3K27ac ChIPseq was performed.",

Acquired resistance to cancer drug therapies almost always occurs in advanced-stage patients even following a significant response to treatment. In addition to mutational mechanisms, various non-mutational resistance mechanisms have now been recognized. We previously described a chromatin-mediated subpopulation of reversibly drug-tolerant persisters (DTPs) that is dynamically maintained within a wide variety of tumor cell populations. Here, we explored a potential role for microRNAs in such transient drug tolerance. Functional screening of 879 human microRNAs revealed miR-371-3p as a potent suppressor of drug tolerance. PRDX6 (peroxiredoxin 6) was identified as a key target of miR-371-3p in establishing drug tolerance by regulating PLA2/PKCa activity and reactive oxygen species. PRDX6 expression is associated with poor prognosis in cancers of multiple tissue origins. These findings implicate miR-371-3p as a suppressor of PRDX6 and suggest that co-targeting of PRDX6 or modulating miR-371-3p expression together with targeted cancer therapies may delay or prevent acquired drug resistance.

Here, we quantified the RNA payload within tumor-derived exosomes and the resulting dynamic transcriptomic response to cytotoxic T cells upon exosome delivery to better understand how tumor-derived exosomes can alter immune cell function. Exosomes derived from B16F0 melanoma cells were enriched for a subset of coding and non-coding RNAs that did not reflect the abundance in the parental cell. Upon exosome delivery, RNAseq revealed the dynamic changes in the transcriptome of CTLL2 cytotoxic T cells.

In B cells, LMO2 is specifically up-regulated in the Germinal Center (GC) reaction and is expressed in GC-derived non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. LMO2 is one of the most powerful prognostic indicators in DLBCL patients. However, its function in GC B cells and DLBCL is currently unknown. In the present study we characterized the LMO2 transcriptome and interactome in DLBCL cells. LMO2 regulates genes implicated in kinetochore function, chromosome assembly and mitosis. Overexpression of LMO2 in DLBCL cell lines results in centrosome amplification. In DLBCL, the LMO2 complex contains some of the traditional partners such as LDB1, E2A, HEB, Lyl1, ETO2 and SP1, but not TAL1 or GATA proteins. Furthermore, we identified novel LMO2 interacting partners: ELK1, NFATc1 and LEF-1 proteins. Reporter assays revealed that LMO2 increases transcriptional activity of NFATc1 and decreases transcriptional activity of LEF-1 proteins. Overall, our studies identified a novel LMO2 transcriptome and interactome in DLBCL and provide a platform for future elucidation of LMO2 function in GC B-cells and DLBCL pathogenesis. RCK8 DLBCL cell lines were stably transfected with control plasmid or plasmid+LMO2.",

Chromatin remodeling is a key requirement for transcriptional control of cellular differentiation. However, the factors that alter chromatin architecture in mammary stem cells (MaSCs) are poorly understood. Here we show that Bptf, the largest subunit of the NURF chromatin remodeling complex, is essential for MaSC self-renewal and differentiation of epithelial cells in the mammary gland. Bptf depletion arrests cells at a previously undefined stage of epithelial differentiation that is associated with an incapacity to achieve the luminal cell fate. Moreover, genome-wide analysis of DNA accessibility following genetic and chemical inhibition of Bptf, suggests a role for this factor in maintaining the open chromatin landscape of cis-regulatory elements in mammary epithelial cells (MECs). Collectively, our study implicates Bptf in maintaining the unique epigenetic state of MaSCs.

Background: Intrinsic glioma subtypes (IGS) are molecularly similar tumors that can be identified based on unsupervised gene-expression analysis. Here, we have evaluated the clinical relevance of these subtypes within EORTC26951, a randomized phase III clinical trial investigating adjuvant procarbazine, CCNU (lomustine) and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy in anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors. Our study is the first to include gene-expression profiles of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) clinical trial samples. Methods: Gene-expression profiling was performed in 140 samples: 47 fresh frozen and 93 FFPE, on HU133_Plus_2.0 and HuEx_1.0_st arrays (Affymetrix), respectively. Results: All previously identified six intrinsic glioma subtypes are present in EORTC26951. This confirms that different molecular subtypes are present within a well-defined histological subtype. Intrinsic subtypes are highly prognostic for overall- (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). They are prognostic for PFS independent of clinical (age, performance, tumor location), molecular (1p19qLOH, IDH1 mutation, MGMT methylation) and histological parameters. Combining known molecular (1p19LOH, IDH1) prognostic parameters with intrinsic subtypes improves outcome prediction (Proportion of Explained Variation 30% v 23%). Specific genetic changes (IDH1, 1p19qLOH and EGFR amplification) segregate into different subtypes. We identified one subtype, IGS-9 (characterized by a high percentage of 1p19qLOH and IDH1 mutations), that especially benefits from PCV chemotherapy. Median OS in this subtype was 5.5 years after radiotherapy (RT) alone v 12.8 years after RT/PCV; P=0.0349; HR 2.18, 95% CI [1.06, 4.50]. Conclusion: Intrinsic subtypes are highly prognostic in EORTC26951 and improve outcome prediction when combined with other prognostic factors. Tumors assigned to IGS-9 benefit from adjuvant PCV.

Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease usually caused by large homozygous expansions of GAA repeat sequences in intron 1 of the frataxin (FXN) gene. FRDA patients have low FXN mRNA and frataxin protein levels when compared with heterozygous carriers or healthy controls. Presently, there is no effective treatment for FRDA, and biomarkers to measure therapeutic trial outcomes and/or to gauge disease progression are lacking. Peripheral tissues, including blood cells, buccal cells, and skin fibroblasts, can readily be isolated from FRDA patients and used to define molecular hallmarks of disease pathogenesis. However, because these tissues are not directly involved in disease pathogenesis, their relevance as models of the molecular aspects of the disease is yet to be decided. Transcriptome profiling of FRDA skin fibroblasts revealed significantly upregulated expression of genes encoding plasma membrane solute carrier proteins. Conversely, the expression of genes encoding accessory factors and enzymes involved in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial protein synthesis was consistently decreased in the FRDA cells. Finally, comparison of genes differentially expressed in FRDA fibroblasts to 3 previously published gene expression signatures defined for FRDA blood cells showed substantial overlap between the independent datasets, including correspondingly deficient expression of antioxidant defense genes. Together, these results indicate that gene expression profiling of cells derived from peripheral tissues can, in fact, consistently reveal novel molecular pathways of the disease. We used RNA sequencing to profile the transcriptomes of primary fibroblast cell lines derived from 18 FRDA patients and 17 unaffected control individuals. .",

TWIST1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor is essential for the development of cranial mesoderm and cranial neural crest-derived craniofacial structures. Our previous work showed that, in the absence of TWIST1, some cells within the cranial mesoderm adopt an abnormal epithelial configuration. Here, we show by transcriptome analysis that loss of TWIST1 in the cranial mesoderm is accompanied by a reduction in the expression of genes that are associated with cell-extracellular matrix interactions and the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics. By comparing the transcriptional profiles of cranial mesoderm-specific Twist1 loss-of-function mutant and control mouse embryos, we identified a set of genes that are both TWIST1-dependent and predominantly expressed in the mesoderm. By ChIP-seq in a cell line model of a TWIST1-dependent mesenchymal state, we identified, among the downstream genes, three direct transcriptional targets of TWIST1: Ddr2, Pcolce and Tgfbi. Our findings show that the mesenchymal properties of the cranial mesoderm is likely to be regulated by a network of TWIST1 targets genes that influence the extracellular matrix and cell-matrix interactions, and collectively they are required for the morphogenesis of the craniofacial structures. For microarray analysis of CM-CKO embryos, embryo heads of four genotypes were collected at E8.5 (5-7 somites) and E9.5 (18- 20 somites): CM-CKO (Twist1flox/del; Mesp1Cre/+), CM-Het (Twist1flox/wt; Mesp1Cre/+), Het (Twist1flox/del; Mesp1+/+) and Control (Twist1flox/wt; Mesp1+/+).Sample sizes for E9.5 were as follows: Control, n=3; CM-CKO, n=4; Het, n=4; CM-Het, n=4).

Objective: We hypothesized that type 1 diabetes (T1D) is accompanied by changes in gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) due to dysregulation of adaptive and innate immunity, counterregulatory responses to immune dysregulation, insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia. Research Design and Methods: Microarray analysis was performed on PBMCs from 43 patients with newly diagnosed T1D, 12 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 24 healthy controls. One and four month follow-up samples were obtained from 20 of the T1D patients.Results: Microarray analysis identified 282 genes differing in expression between newlydiagnosed T1D patients and controls at a false discovery rate of 0.05. Changes in expression of interleukin-1b (IL1B), early growth response gene 3 (EGR3), and prostaglandin-endoperoxidesynthase 2 (PTGS2) resolved within four months of insulin therapy and were also observed in T2D suggesting that they resulted from hyperglycemia. With use of a knowledge base, 81/282 genes could be placed within a network of interrelated genes with predicted functions including apoptosis and cell proliferation. IL1B and the MYC oncogene were the most highly-connected genes in the network. IL1B was highly overexpressed in both T1D and T2D, whereas MYC was dysregulated only in T1D.Conclusion: T1D and T2D likely share a final common pathway for beta cell dysfunction that includes secretion of interleukin-1b and prostaglandins by immune effector cells, exacerbating existing beta cell dysfunction, and causing further hyperglycemia. The results identify several targets for disease-modifying therapy of diabetes and potential biomarkers for monitoring treatment efficacy.Keywords: Diabetes, microarray analysis, peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We obtained blood samples from 24 healthy volunteers, 43 newly diagnosed T1D patients and 12 newly diagnosed T2D patients. All study participants were between the ages of 2 and 18 years. We collected samples one and four months after diagnosis from the last 20 of the T1D patients. For each time point one sample did not pass quality control and was dropped from the analysis. Patients with T2D were distinguished from T1D on the basis of age, body habitus, presence (11/12 patients) of acanthosis nigricans, family history of type 2 diabetes (11/12 patients), and absence of autoantibodies to insulin, IA-2, and GAD65. We allowed low titers of insulin antibodies in T2D patients (< 4 U/mL), which have been previously reported.

Purpose: The goal of this study is to examine gene expression regulation at the transcriptional and translational levels in response to various forms of nutrient deprivation, and whether there are differences between isogenic transformed and non-transformed cells.Mehods: We apply high-throughput sequencing of ribosome footprints (ribosome profiling) and poly(A) RNA (RNA sequencing) in an isogenic pair of transformed (tamoxifen-treated) and non-transformed (ethanol control) MCF10A-ER-Src cells subjected to the metabolic stresses that differentially affect global protein synthesis (Figure 1): deprivation of glutamine (for 30min and 4 hours), glucose (4hours), cysteine/cystine (4hours) or leucine/isoleucine/valine (brach-chain aminoacids - BCAA) (4hours). The same experiments were also performed in transformed ER-Src MCF10A treated with torin1 (500nM) for 4 hours.Results: Genome-wide translational profiling of glutamine deprived ER-Src MCF10A cells (for 30 minutes) shows increased translation of uORFs-containing mRNAs and down-regulation of ribosomal protein mRNAs, which is followed by increased translation and transcription of cytokine and inflammatory mRNAs (after 4 hours of glutamine deprivation). The transcription and translation of inflammatory and cytokine mRNAs is also stimulated in response to 4 hours deprivation of glucose, cysteine/cystine and BCAA, with the extent of stimulation correlating with the i) decrease in global protein synthesis and ii) down-regulation of all translationally-repressed mRNAs or ribosomal protein mRNAs.Conclusions: Pro-inflammatory gene expression is associated with translational repression in response to short-term nutrient deprivation. Ribosome occupancy and mRNAs levels in transformed and non-transformed cells cultured for i) 30 minutes under complete (Ctrl) or glutamine-free (NoQ) DMEM medium, and ii) 4 hours under complete (Ctrl), glucose-free (NoG), glutamine-free (NoQ), cysteine/cystine-free (NoCys) or leucine, isoleucine, valine (NoBCAA)-free DMEM medium.

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to independently validate two biomarkers, a 44-gene DNA Damage Immune Response (DDIR) signature and stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs), as prognostic markers in TNBC patients treated with adjuvant doxorubicin (A) and cyclophosphamide (C) in SWOG 9313. Materials & Methods: 425 centrally determined TNBC cases from S9313 were identified. DDIR signature was performed on RNA isolated from FFPE tumor tissue (n=381), and samples were classified as DDIR-negative or positive using predefined cutoffs. Evaluation of sTILs was performed as previously described. Markers were tested for prognostic value for disease-free and overall survival (DFS, OS) using Cox regression models adjusted for treatment assignment nodal status and tumor size. Results: Among 425 TNBC patients, median age was 45 years, and 33% were node-positive. DDIR was successfully tested in 90% (381/425) of cases, of which 62% were DDIR signature-positive. DDIR signature positivity was associated with improved DFS (HR=0.67; 95% CI 0.48-0.92, P=0.014) and OS (HR=0.61; 95% CI 0.43-0.89, P=0.009). sTILs density assessment was available in 99% of patients and was associated with improved DFS (HR=0.70; 95% CI 0.51-0.96, P=0.028 for sTILs density >=20% vs. <20%) and OS (HR=0.59; 95% CI 0.41-0.85, P=0.004 for sTILs density >=20% vs. <20%). The DDIR signature score and sTILs density were moderately correlated (r=0.62) which precluded statistical significance for DFS in a joint model (P=0.08 for DDIR and P=0.25 for sTILs). Conclusion: The prognostic role of sTILs and DDIR in early-stage TNBC was confirmed. DDIR signature conferred improved prognosis in two-thirds of TNBC patients treated with adjuvant AC. DDIR signature has potential to stratify outcome and identify patients with less projected benefit following AC chemotherapy.

During chronic liver disease, tissue remodeling leads to dramatic changes and accumulation of matrix components. Matrix metalloproteases and their inhibitors have been involved in the regulation of matrix degradation. However, the role of other proteases remains incompletely defined. We undertook a gene-expression screen of human liver fibrosis samples using a dedicated gene array selected for relevance to protease activities, identifying the ADAMTS1 (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase [ADAM] with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 1) gene as an important node of the protease network. Up-regulation of ADAMTS1 in fibrosis was found to be associated with hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation. ADAMTS1 is synthesized as 110-kDa latent forms and is processed by HSCs to accumulate as 87-kDa mature forms in fibrotic tissues. Structural evidence has suggested that the thrombospondin motif-containing domain from ADAMTS1 may be involved in interactions with, and activation of, the major fibrogenic cytokine, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b). Indeed, we observed direct interactions between ADAMTS1 and latency-associated peptide-TGF-b (LAP-TGF-b). ADAMTS1 induces TGF-b activation through the interaction of the ADAMTS1 KTFR peptide with the LAP-TGF-b LKSL peptide. Down-regulation of ADAMTS1 in HSCs decreases the release of TGF-b competent for transcriptional activation, and KTFR competitor peptides directed against ADAMTS1 block the HSC-mediated release of active TGF-b. Using a mouse liver fibrosis model, we show that carbon tetrachloride treatment induces ADAMTS1 expression in parallel to that of type I collagen. Importantly, concurrent injection of the KTFR peptide prevents liver damage. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that up-regulation of ADAMTS1 in HSCs constitutes a new mechanism for control of TGF-b activation in chronic liver disease.

Accumulating evidence indicates that altered miRNA expression is crucially involved in lung cancer development, but only little has been elucidated about how MYC, an archetypical oncogene, is regulated by miRNAs, especially through a mechanism involving the MYC cofactor(s). In this study, we aimed at identifying miRNAs involved in the regulation of MYC transcriptional activity in lung cancers. To this end, we have taken an integrative approach with combinatorial usage of miRNA and mRNA expression profile datasets of patients' tumor tissues as well as those of MYC-inducible cell lines in vitro. We report here that in addition to miRNAs previously reported to be directly regulating or regulated by MYC including let-7 and miR-17-92, our strategy allowed us to identify miR-342-3p as the one capable of indirectly regulating MYC activity through direct repression of a MYC-cooperating molecule, E2F1. Furthermore, the miR-342-3p module activity, which we defined as a gene set reflecting experimentally substantiated influence of miR-342-3p on mRNA expression, was found to be inversely correlated with MYC activity reflected in the MYC module activity in three independent datasets of lung adenocarcinoma patients obtained by the Director's Challenge Consortium of the United States (P=1.94x10-73), the National Cancer Center of Japan (P=9.05x10-34) and our own in this study (P=3.37x10-6). Our integrative approach thus appears to be useful to elucidate inter-regulatory relationships between miRNAs and a protein coding-gene of interest, even those present in tumor tissues in patients, which still remains a challenge to better understand the pathogenesis of this devastating disease.

We designed seven siRNAs based on the conserved HBV sequences and tested their effects on the expression of HBV genes following sorting of siRNA positive cells. Among these seven siRNAs, siRNA-1 and siRNA-7 were found to effectively suppress HBV gene expressions. We further addressed the global gene expression changes in stable HBV-producing cells induced by siRNA-1 and siRNA-7 using human genome-wide oligo microarrays. Data from the gene expression profilings indicated that siRNA-1 and siRNA-7 altered the expression of 54 and 499 genes, respectively, in HepG2.2.15 cells, which revealed the different siRNA had a varied pattern of gene expression profile and suggested complicated influence of siRNA on host cell. We further observed that eighteen of these genes were suppressed by both siRNA-1 and siRNA-7. Interestingly, seven of these genes were originally activated by HBV, which suggested these seven genes might be involved in the HBV-host cell interaction. Finally, we have compared the effects of siRNA and lamivudine on HBV and host cell, which revealed that siRNA is more effective in inhibiting the HBV expression at mRNA and protein level in vitro, and the gene expression profiling of HepG2.2.15 treated by lamivudine is totally different from siRNA!-s.Keywords: other. siRNA vs. control lamivudine vs. mock.",

Encoding only ten major proteins, Influenza A virus (IAV) gains access to both the cell and nucleus, replicates its eight genomic segments, then enters the cytoplasm to assemble and egress. This is achieved through an expansive network of interactions with the host and a coordinated production of viral components. Here we show that upon infection, primary transcription of the virus results in the accumulation of the splice product, Nuclear Export Protein (NEP), which associates with the viral polymerase leading to the synthesis of segment-specific small viral RNAs (svRNAs). Here we demonstrate that svRNA biology is responsible for coordinating segment-specific amplification and is predominantly required for amplification of the three larger polymerase segments. Generation of svRNA ambiguity results in predictable changes in segment-specific vRNA levels and up to a five log attenuation. Together, these data elucidate the molecular function of svRNAs as essential mediators responsible for maintaining a stoichiometric balance between genomic segments and establish these small RNAs as functional components of the virus.

Sorafenib is the only approved targeted drug for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its effect on patients' survival gain is limited and varies over a wide range depending on patho-genetic conditions. Thus, enhancing the efficacy of sorafenib and finding a reliable predictive biomarker are crucuial to achieve efficient control of HCCs. In this study, we employed a systems approach by combining transcriptome analysis of the mRNA changes in HCC cell lines in response to sorafenib with network analysis to investigate the action and resistance mechanism of sorafenib. Gene ontology and gene set analysis revealed that proteotoxic stress and apoptosis modules are activated in the presence of sorafenib. Further analysis of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress network model combined with in vitro experiments showed that introducing an additional stress by treating the orally active protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) inhibitor (PACMA 31) can synergistically increase the efficacy of sorafenib in vitro and in vivo, which was confirmed using a mouse xenograft model. We also found that HCC patients with high PDI expression show resistance to sorafenib and poor clinical outcomes, compared to the low PDI expression group. These results suggest that PDI is a promising therapeutic target for enhancing the efficacy of sorafenib and can also be a biomarker for predicting sorafenib responsiveness. Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells and subjected to RT-PCR analysis.

    "text": "VE-Cadherin-Mediated Epigenetic Regulation of Endothelial Gene Expression. Rationale: The mechanistic foundation of vascular maturation is still largely unknown. Several human pathologies are characterized by deregulated angiogenesis and unstable blood vessels. Solid tumours, for instance, get their nourishment from newly formed structurally abnormal vessels which present wide and irregular inter-endothelial junctions. Expression and clustering of the main endothelial-specific adherens junction protein, vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin (VEC), upregulate genes with key roles in endothelial differentiation and stability.Objective: We aim at understanding the molecular mechanisms through which VEC triggers the expression of a set of genes involved in endothelial differentiation and vascular stabilization.Methods and Results: We compared a VEC-null cell line with the same line reconstituted with VEC wild type cDNA. VEC expression and clustering upregulated endothelial-specific genes with key roles in vascular stabilization including claudin-5, Vascular Endothelial-Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (VE-PTP) and von Willebrand factor (vWf). Mechanistically VEC exerts this effect by inhibiting Polycomb protein activity on the specific gene promoters. This is achieved by preventing nuclear translocation of FoxO1 and b-catenin, which contribute to Polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2) binding to promoter regions of claudin-5, VE-PTP and vWf. VE-cadherin/b-catenin complex also sequesters a core subunit of PRC2 (Ezh2) at the cell membrane, preventing its nuclear translocation. Inhibition of Ezh2/VE-cadherin association increases Ezh2 recruitment to claudin-5, VE-PTP and vWf promoters, causing gene downregulation. RNAseq comparison of VEC-null and VEC-positive cells suggested a more general role of VE-cadherin in activating endothelial genes and triggering a vascular stability-related gene expression program. In pathological angiogenesis of human ovarian carcinomas, reduced VEC expression paralleled decreased levels of Claudin-5 and VE-PTP. Conclusions: These data extend the knowledge of Polycomb-mediated regulation of gene expression to endothelial cell differentiation and vessel maturation. The identified mechanism opens novel therapeutic opportunities to modulate endothelial gene expression and induce vascular normalization through pharmacological inhibition of the Polycomb-mediated repression system.

Aberrant CpG methylation is a universal trait of cancer cell genomes and can result in epigenetic modulation of gene activity; however, at which stages tumour-specific epigenetic patterns arise is unknown. Here, we analyse the methylome of APCM in mouse intestinal adenoma as a model of intestinal cancer initiation, and inventory a map of over 13,000 adenoma-specific recurrent differentially methylated regions (DMRs). We find that multiple genes coding for Polycomb proteins are upregulated in adenoma, and concomitantly, hypermethylated DMRs form preferentially at Polycomb target sites. We establish that DMRs are absent from proliferating intestinal epithelial cells or intestinal stem cells, and thus arise de novo after loss of APC. Importantly, a core set of DMRs is conserved in human colon cancer, defining a class of early epigenetic alterations that are distinct from known sets of epigenetically silenced tumour suppressors. The data presented suggests a sequence of events that leads to an altered methylome of colon cancer cells, and may allow more specific selection of clinical epigenetic biomarkers.

The unfolded protein response (UPR) and activation of XBP1 is necessary for high secretory efficiency and functional differentiation of antibody secreting cells (ASCs). The UPR additionally includes a branch in which membrane-bound transcription factors, exemplified by ATF6, undergo intramembrane-proteolysis by the sequential action of site-1 (MBTPS1/S1P) and site-2 proteases (MBTPS2/S2P) and release of the cytoplasmic domain as an active transcription factor. Such regulation is shared with a family of CREB3-related transcription factors and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). Of these, we identify that the CREB3 family member CREB3L2 is strongly induced and activated during the transition from B-cell to plasma cell state. Inhibition of site-1 protease leads to a profound reduction in plasmablast number linked to induction of autophagy. Plasmablasts generated in the presence of site-1 protease inhibitor segregated into CD38high and CD38low populations, the latter characterized by a marked reduction in the capacity to secrete IgG. Site-1 protease inhibition is accompanied by a distinctive change in gene expression associated with amino acid synthesis, steroid and fatty acid synthesis pathways.

We have previously identified a prognostic 31-gene expression signature in locally advanced cervical cancer that is associated with tumor hypoxia and reflected by the dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance (DCE-MR) image parameter ABrix. To bring the signature closer to clinical use, we here aimed to construct a classifier with key signature genes that retained an association to ABrix and separated the patients into groups with different hypoxia status and chemoradiotherapy outcome.A training cohort of 42 patients and two independent cohorts of 108 and 131 patients were included. Gene expression data were generated from tumor biopsies by two Illumina array generations (WG6, HT12), and for a subset of 74 patients, by the RT-qPCR platform. The amplitude ABrix in the Brix pharmacokinetic model was extracted from DCE-MR images of 64 patients and used as a measure of hypoxia.Different classifiers were constructed in the training cohort. By evaluating their ability to separate the patients correctly according to ABrix, a 6-gene classifier with strong correlation to ABrix was identified. In validation analyses, the classifier separated the patients into two groups with 5-years progression-free survival probabilities of 85% and 60%. Both the prognostic value and ABrix-association were confirmed in an independent cohort, and robustness across array generations and assay platforms was demonstrated. The prognostic value was independent of existing clinical markers.A robust, prognostic hypoxia classifier has been constructed, and might be used alone or combined with DCE-MR imaging to achieve an early indication of a patient's risk of failure and allocate high risk patients to adjuvant hypoxia-targeted therapy. Total 150 patient and 2 cell line samples were analysed with Illumina WG-6, while 136 patient and 6 cell line samples were analyzied with Illumina HT-12.",

In vitro neural stem cell models are widely used to model a wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions. However, how well such models correspond to in vivo brain has not been evaluated in an unbiased, comprehensive manner. We used transcriptomic analyses to compare in vitro systems to developing human fetal brain and observed strong conservation of in vivo gene expression and network architecture in differentiating primary human neural progenitor cells (phNPCs). Conserved modules are enriched in genes associated with ASD, supporting the utility of phNPCs for studying neuropsychiatric disease. We also developed and validated a machine learning approach called CoNTExT that identifies the developmental maturity and regional identity of in vitro models. We observed strong differences between in vitro models, including hiPSC-derived neural progenitors from multiple laboratories. This work provides a framework for evaluating in vitro systems and supports their value in studying the molecular mechanisms of human neurodevelopmental disease. In this GEO submission, we upload data from 5 lines of phNPCs as well as hiPSCs cultured in two different laboratories all at multiple differentiation time points. phNPCs: For each of 5 lines generated from 3 donors (15-16 PCW), two independent differentiation experiments each containing two replicates were performed and harvested at four time points (1, 4, 8, 12 wks PD; ~16 samples per line; 77 total samples).

Considering the crucial role of Fe in many metabolic pathways e.g., DNA synthesis, it is important to understand the function of MTf. To define the roles of MTf, a MTf knockout (MTf -/-) mouse model was developed. Examination of the MTf -/- mice demonstrated no phenotypic differences compared to wild-type littermates. However, microarray analysis showed differential expression of molecules involved in proliferation such as Mef2a, Tcf4, Gls and Apod in MTf -/- mice compared to MTf +/+ littermates, suggesting a role for MTf in proliferation and tumorigenesis.Keywords: Melanotransferrin, knockout mouse, comparative genomic hybridization.

Background: Aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1C family member 3 (AKR1C3), one of four identified human AKR enzymes, catalyzes steroid, prostaglandin, and xenobiotic metabolism. In the prostate, AKR1C3 is up-regulated in localized and advanced prostate adenocarcinoma, and is associated with prostate cancer (PCa) aggressiveness. Here we provide initial evidence for potential roles of AKR1C3 in PCa progression. Methods: Spatial distribution of AKR1C3 was analyzed using immunohistochemical staining in prostate adenocarcinoma tissue array. Human PCa PC-3 cells were stably transfected with AKR1C3 cDNA to establish PC3-AKR1C3 transfectants. Microarray and bioinformatics analyses were performed to identify pathways that are activated by elevated AKR1C3 expression in PCa cells. Functional confirmation of microarray and bioinformatics results was performed by immunoblot analysis and an in vitro Matrigel angiogenesis assay. Results: Elevated AKR1C3 expression was specifically limited to human prostate adenocarcinoma. Microarray and bioinformatics analysis suggested that elevated AKR1C3 expression in PC-3 cells modulates estradiol and androgen metabolism and activates insulin growth factor (IGF)-1 and Akt signaling pathways. Immunoblots confirmed that phosphorylated levels of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and Akt are significantly up-regulated in PC3-AKR1C3 as compared to mock transfectants. PC3-AKR1C3 transfectants promoted endothelial cell tube formation in Matrigel as compared to parental PC-3 cells and mock transfectants. Conclusion: Microarray and bioinformatics data followed by biological analyses suggest that elevated AKR1C3 expression in PC-3 cells promotes PCa angiogenesis and aggressiveness. These results suggest AKR1C3 can promote the aggressiveness of PCa through modulating estrogen and androgen metabolism with subsequent activation of growth factor IGF-1 and cytoplasmic Akt signaling pathways. Total RNA from mock- and ACR1C3 transfected PC-3 cells was isolated, with 2 or 3 biological replicates each. Gene expression data from AKR1C3 transfected PC-3 cells were compared with mock-transfected data.",

While insulin is known to regulate glucagon secretion via its receptor in alpha cells, the role of downstream proteins and signaling pathways underlying the actions of insulin are not fully defined. Using in vivo (knockout) and in vitro (knockdown) studies targeting insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins, we compared the relative roles of IRS1 versus IRS2 in regulating alpha cell function. Alpha cell-specific IRS1 knock out (alpha IRS1KO) mice exhibit glucose intolerance and inappropriate glucagon suppression during glucose-tolerance tests. In contrast, alpha cell-specific IRS2 knock outs (alpha IRS2KO) manifest normal glucose tolerance and suppression of glucagon secretion after glucose administration. Alpha cell lines with stable knockdown of IRS1 (alpha IRS1KD) are unable to repress glucagon mRNA expression and exhibit reduction in phosphorylation of AKT. However, glucagon mRNA expression was suppressed in response to insulin stimulation in a stable IRS2 knock down alpha cell line (alpha IRS2KD). Alpha IRS1KD cells also display suppressed global protein translation including glucagon, impaired cytoplasmic Ca2+ response and mitochondrial function. These data argue for IRS1 as a dominant regulator of pancreatic alpha cell function. To identify candidate genes that are involved in the regulation of IRS1/2-mediated signaling in alpha cells, we performed gene expression microarray analysis of control, IRS1 knockdown (KD) or IRS2 KD alpha cells.

Resident memory T cells (TRM) remain parked in nonlymphoid tissues and often stably express CD69. We recently identified TRM within SLO, and this study addresses knowledge gaps in their origin and phenotype. Parabiosis of 'dirty' mice revealed that CD69 expression is insufficient to infer stable residence. Using selective depletion strategies, parabiosis, imaging, tissue grafting, and photoactivatable T cells, we report that restimulation of TRM within the skin or mucosa results in a substantial increase in TRM that patrol all regions of draining lymph nodes.

    "text": "Role of Branched Chain Amino Acid Transaminase 1 (BCAT1) in Acute Myeloid Leukemia [expression_BCAT1-KD #2]. The branched chain amino acid (BCAA) pathway and high levels of BCAA transaminase 1 (BCAT1) have recently been associated with aggressiveness in several cancer entities. However, the mechanistic role of BCAT1 in this process remains largely uncertain. By performing high-resolution proteomic analysis of human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) stem cell (LSC) and non-LSC populations, we found the BCAA pathway enriched and BCAT1 overexpressed in LSCs. We show that BCAT1, which transfers a-amino groups from BCAAs to a-ketoglutarate (aKG), is a critical regulator of intracellular aKG homeostasis. Next to its role in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle aKG is an essential co-factor for aKG-dependent dioxygenases such as EGLN1 and the TET family of DNA demethylases. Knockdown of BCAT1 in leukaemia cells caused accumulation of aKG leading to HIF1a protein degradation mediated by EGLN1. This resulted in a growth and survival defect and abrogated leukaemia-initiating potential. In contrast, overexpression (OE) of BCAT1 in leukaemia cells decreased intracellular aKG levels and caused DNA hypermethylation via altered TET activity. BCAT1high AMLs displayed a DNA hypermethylation phenotype similar to cases carrying mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDHmut), in which TET2 is inhibited by the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate. High levels of BCAT1 strongly correlate with shorter overall survival in IDHwtTET2wt, but not IDHmut or TET2mut AMLs. Gene sets characteristic for IDHmut AMLs were enriched in IDHwtTETwtBCAT1high patient samples. BCAT1high AMLs showed robust enrichment for LSC signatures and paired sample analysis revealed a significant increase of BCAT1 levels upon disease relapse. In summary, by limiting intracellular aKG, BCAT1 links BCAA catabolism to HIF1a stability and regulation of the epigenomic landscape. Our results suggest the BCAA-BCAT1-aKG pathway as a therapeutic target to compromise LSC function in IDHwtTET2wt AML patients. Primary AML samples were lentivirally transduced with shBCAT1-2 or shNT as control, transduced cells were FACS sorted 48 hrs after the transduction, cells were lysed and RNA was extracted.",

    "text": "Dendritic Cells. Dendritic cells (DC) play a crucial role in initiating, shaping and controlling the immune response. They are the most important antigen presenting cells in the immune system. DC can be divided in immature and mature DC. DCs reside in an immature state in most tissues or they circulate in the blood, where they recognize and phagocytose pathogens and other antigens. Direct contact with many pathogens leads to the maturation of DCs. The property to stimulate T cells is reserved for mature DC (O'Doherty, U. 1994). This functional maturation results in an up-regulation of the surface molecule MHC class II, adhesion molecules (CD54 and CD58) and co-stimulatory receptors (CD80 and CD86) as well as decreased antigen uptake capacity (CD206). (Banchereau, J. and Steinman, R.M. 1998). Immunosuppressive drugs have revolutionized organ transplantation and improved the therapeutic management of autoimmune diseases. These drugs interfere on lymphocytes but they also act at the earliest stage of immune response. They are targeting key functions of dendritic cells (Hackstein H. and Thomson A.W., 2004 review). Sanglifehrin A (SFA) is a new immunosuppressive drug. It is a representative of a class of macrolides produced by the actinomycetes strain Streptomyces A92-308110 that bind to cyclophilin A (CypA), the binding protein of cyclosporine A (CsA). Most studies about immunosuppressive effects of SFA took place on T and B lymphocytes. Unlike CsA, the cyclophilin-SFA-complex shows no effect on the calcium-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (Zenke, G. 2001). Unlike CsA and FK506, SFA shows no inhibition of IL-2 expression (Zenke, G. 2001; Zhang, L.H. 2001), nor does it suppress IL-2 receptor transcription (Zhang, L.H. 2001) in T lymphocytes. It could be shown that SFA reduces the Interleukin 12 production in dendritic cells (Steinschulte, C. 2003). IL-12p70 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammation and autoimmune diseases. DCs generated in the presence of SFA show reduced macropinocytosis and lectin-mediated endocytosis. In contrast, CD89 und CD32 were increased by SFA. The effect of SFA on the expression of Ag uptake receptors and Ag capture by DCs makes SFA unique among other immunophilin-binding immunosuppressive drugs (Woltman, A. 2004). Our goal is to investigate the gene expression profile of SFA treated mature human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Comparison of SFA-stimulated versus unstimulated cells. 7 biological replicates.",

Ontologically, arterial MPh arise before birth, though CX3CR1-, Csf1r-, and Flt3-driven fate mapping approaches demonstrate MPh colonization occurs through successive contributions of yolk sac (YS) and conventional hematopoiesis. In adulthood, arterial MPh renewal is driven by local proliferation rather than monocyte recruitment from the blood.

Tet1 and Tet2 are abundantly expressed in HSC/HPCs and implicated in the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies. Tet2-deletion in mice causes myeloid malignancies, while Tet1-null mice develop B-cell lymphoma after an extended period of latency. Interestingly, TET1 and TET2 were often concomitantly down-regulated in acute B-lymphocytic leukemia. Here, we investigated the overlapping and non-redundant functions of Tet1/Tet2 in HSC maintenance and development of hematological malignancies using Tet1/2 double knockout (DKO) mice. DKO and Tet2-/- HSC/HPCs had overlapping and unique 5hmC and 5mC profiles and behaved differently. DKO mice exhibited strikingly decreased incidence and delayed onset of myeloid malignancies compared to Tet2-/- mice and in contrast developed lethal B-cell malignancies. Transcriptome analysis of DKO tumors revealed expression changes in many genes dysregulated in human B-cell malignancies, such as LMO2, BCL6 and MYC. These results highlight the critical roles of TET1 or TET2 individually and their cross-talks in the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies. Given the role of Tet proteins in 5mC oxidation, we employed a previously established chemical labeling and affinity purification method coupled with high-throughput sequencing (hMe-Seal) to profile the genome-wide distribution of 5hmC, as well as methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) coupled with high-throughput sequencing (MeDIP-seq) to profile 5mC using BM LK cells purified from young WT, Tet2-/- and DKO mice (6-10 wks old).",

Real-time PCR was used to confirm a type I interferon (IFN) gene signature in patients with SLE, and the IFN-regulated proteins PRKRA, IFITM1 and CD69 (p<0.0001) were found to be up-regulated in platelets from SLE patients as compared to healthy volunteers. Notably, patients with a history of vascular disease had increased expression of type I IFN-regulated proteins as well as more activated platelets as compared with patients without vascular disease. We suggest that interferogenic immune complexes stimulate production of IFNa which up-regulates the megakaryocytic type I IFN-regulated genes and proteins. This could affect platelet activation and contribute to development of vascular disease in SLE. In addition, platelets with type I IFN signature could be a novel marker for vascular disease in SLE.

This therapy relies on efficient replication of virus in tumor cells in vivo with minimal or no replication in normal tissues. We recently described GLV-1h68 as a modified Vaccinia Virus (VACV) construct with exclusive in vivo tropism for tumor cells in experimental animal models. Moreover, we had previously observed a cell line-specific relationship between the ability of GLV-1h68 to replicate in vitro during the first 20 hours following infection and the in vivo ability to colonize and eliminate the corresponding tumor implant. Thus, we surveyed the in vitro permissivity to GLV-1h68 replication of the NCI-60 panel of cell lines, extensively characterized and used for the assessment of novel therapeutic modalities. All cell lines were cultured and infected in identical conditions. Pre-infection transcriptional profiling was obtained to search for correlates of permissivity to viral infection. Selected cell lines were also tested for permissivity to another VACV and a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) strain. We observed that permissivity to VACV infection during the first 20 hours is quite heterogeneous among cell lines but highly reproducible within each cell line. The tissue of origin of each cell line does not influence permissivity to infection with the exception of B cell derivation. Permissivity correlates between two VACV constructs and between them and VSV suggesting a common permissive phenotype. No clear transcriptional pattern predictive of permissivity to infection could be identified though weak associations were observed that suggest a multifactorial control of viral replication. This study adds to the current characterization of the NCI-60 panel to guide the design and interpretation of experimental models testing oncolytic therapies. Seventy-four microarray samples were obtained from 8 renal cancer cell lines (786-0, A498, ACHN, CAKI-I, RXF-393, SN12C, TK-10, UO-31); 12 melanoma cell lines (888-MEL, 1858-MEL, 1936-MEL, 397, A375-MEL, LOX IMVI, M14, SK-MEL-2, SK-MEL-5, SK-MEL-28, UACC 62, UACC 257 ); 11 lung cancer cell lines (A549 p7, A549 p107, EKVX, HOP-62, HOP-92, NCI-H23, NCI-H226, NCI-H322M, NCI-H460, NCI-H522, NCI-H1299); 13 colon cancer cell lines (HCT-15, HCT-116, HT-29 p155, HT-29 p9, KM-12, SW-620, Colo 205, HCC 2998, NCI-ADR-RES, OVCAR 3 p7, OVCAR 3 p42, OVCAR 5, SK-OV-3); 3 ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCAR 4, OVCAR 8, IGROV); 1 cervical cancer cell line (Siha); 6 brain cancer cell lines (SNB 19, SF 295, SF 298, SNB 75, U251, SF 539); 7 breast cancer cell lines (BT-549, GI101A, HS-578T, MCF 7, MDA-MB-231 p41, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231 p6); 7 hematopoietic cancer cell lines (CCFR-CEM, HL-60, K-562, MOLT-4, RPMI 8226, SR, T-47D); 3 prostatic cancer cell lines (Du-145, PC 3 p7, PC 3 p35); 1 hepatic cancer cell lines (Huh 7.5.1); and 2 pancreatic cancer cell lines (MIA PACA 2, Panc 1).

Homeobox genes comprise a family of regulatory genes that contain a common homeobox domain and act as transcription factors. Changes in the expression of homeobox genes are observed in many cancers, including leukaemia, colon, skin, prostate, breast, and ovarian cancers. Recent studies indicate that homeobox A5 (HOXA5) may serve as a tumour suppressor gene in breast cells. However, the precise role of HOXA5 in lung cancer remains unclear. Using microarrays and an invasion/metastasis lung adenocarcinoma cell line model, we showed that the expression of HOXA5 is negatively correlated with cancer cell invasion ability. The ectopic expression of HOXA5 in highly invasive cancer cells suppressed cell migration, invasion, and filopodia formation in vitro and inhibited metastatic potential in vivo. The knockdown of HOXA5 expression via a HOXA5-specific siRNA was able to promote the invasiveness of lung cancer cells. Furthermore, HOXA5 expression was associated with improved overall survival and disease-free survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients with wild-type EGFR (P = 0.0199 and 0.0345, respectively). Genome-wide transcriptome and pathway analyses indicated that these effects of HOXA5 may be associated with the regulation of cytoskeletal remodelling. In summary, our studies provide new insights into how HOXA5 may contribute to the suppression of metastasis in lung cancer.We used microarrays to profile the global gene expression of HOXA5-overexpressing cells compared with mock control cells and identified the pathways involved in HOXA5-induced biofunctional alterations. The stably pooled HOXA5-overexpressing cells and mock control cells were selected with 2 mg/ml G418 in CL1-5 cells, human lung adenocarcinoma cells.

We show that Adar1 embryonic lethality is rescued in Adar1; Mavs double mutant mice in which general antiviral responses to cytoplasmic dsRNA are prevented. We propose that inosine bases are epigenetic marks identifying cellular RNA as innate immune OselfO. Consistent with this idea we show that an editing-active cytoplasmic ADAR is required to prevent aberrant immune responses in Adar1 mutant mouse embryo fibroblasts. No dramatic increase in repetitive transcripts is observed. AGS mutations in ADAR1 affect editing by the interferon-inducible cytoplasmic ADAR1 isoform.

The aim of the study was to compare the two different costimuli anti-CD28 (costimulus 2a) and IL-2 (costimulus 2b) - in the presence of a suboptimal anti-CD3 signal (signal 1) - on the de novo activation of freshly purified human naive T cells.To this end, purified human naive T cells were co-incubated for seven days with a tumor vaccine which consisted of gamma-irradiated and Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV)-infected MCF-7 cells (a well-defined mammacarcinoma cell line). The gamma-irradiation dose was 200 Gray (Gy) to suppress the proliferation capacity of the vaccine cells (although the vaccine cells are not killed by such a procedure but still survive for several days); NDV-infection was performed at a dose of 100 hemagglutination units (HU) per 10^7 vaccine cells. The latter led - among others - to the upregulation of the viral surface molecules hemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN) and the fusion protein (F), both of which can serve for the attachment of fusion proteins delivering the activation signals to the naive T cells.The bispecific (bs) fusion proteins used in this study were of the single chain (scFv) format, binding with one arm to the viral HN molecule (for the attachment to the vaccine cells), and with the other arm either to the T cell receptor (TCR)-associated CD3 complex [as a surrogate of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-presented peptide recognized by the TCR] (bsHN-CD3), or to the costimulatory molecule CD28 (bsHN-CD28). Furthermore, a bispecific fusion protein containing the human interleukin (IL)-2 (bsHN-IL-2, a so-called immunocytokine) was used.The gene expression analysis of the differentially activated naive T cells revealed that in the presence of a suboptimal dose of anti-CD3 the two costimuli anti-CD28 (sample d7-S2_280705) and IL-2 (sample d7-S3_280705) led to a highly redundant pattern of gene upregulation in comparison to control samples in which naive T cells received only anti-CD3 (sample d7-S4_280705), anti-CD28 (sample d7-S5_280705) or IL-2 (sample d7-S6_280705) signals alone, or no signal at all (i.e. only vaccine cells; sample d7-S7_280705). All signals were compared to the reference sample which consisited of freshly isolated, non-activated naive T cells (sample d0-S1_280705).Global analysis of the gene expression showed that full naive T cell activation by anti-CD3/anti-CD28 and anti-CD3/IL-2 led to a significant upregulation of 76 and 71 genes, respectively (upregulation was considered to be significant if the relative gene expression was more than 5-fold than in the reference sample). However, the suboptimal anti-CD3 stimulus alone upregulated only 31 genes, the anti-CD28 stimulus alone only 6 genes, and the IL-2 stimulus alone only 22 genes. Naive T cells that reveived virus-modified vaccine cells alone upregulated 18 genes.Equally upregulated genes in anti-CD3/anti-CD28 and anti-CD3/IL-2 activated naive T cells comprised genes coding for both (i) signalling and (ii) effector molecules. Concerning signalling molecules, both costimuli induced the nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) pathway via the key enzymes protein kinase C (PKC)-theta and phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma 1, respectively. Of special note was that signalling molecules of the CD28-mediated stress-activated protein kinase (Sapk) pathway, namely Vav-1, Rac-1 and Jnk-2, were also upregulated by IL-2 costimulation. Upregulated genes coding for effector molecules could be classified into different functional groups: namely regulators of apoptosis, cell adhesion, receptors/ligands and cytokines/chemokines. Some examples of effector molecule-coding genes similarly upregulated in anti-CD3/anti-CD28 and anti-CD3/IL-2 stimulated naive T cells, respectively, were for instance the cell adhesion molecules LFA-1 and CD2, or members of the TNF and TNF receptor superfamilies such as CD27, CD70, CD40 ligand, Fas ligand, as well as TNF-alpha and TNF-beta (and their corresponding receptors). Among apoptosis-related genes, the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-XL as well as the pro-apoptotic gene caspase 9 were upregulated. The latter - together with the observed upregulation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes-associated protein (CTLA)-4 - might be interpreted as an indication of cellular events occurring seven days after stimulation which are aiming at termination of the response. Furthermore, the microarray analysis also revealed and upregulation of the receptor for interferon (IFN)-gamma inducible protein of 10 kDa (IP-10), namely CXCR3, of the IL-12 receptor beta-chain and of the IL-15 receptor alpha-chain; these are often seen in close association with T cell activation in general, with T cell proliferation and with generation of memory T cells. It is also of interest to mention the upregulation of beta-actin which is required for a re-organization of the cytoskeleton and the 40-fold upregulation of the metabolic enzyme glyceraldehye-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) which provides ATP necessary for the increased metabolism of the activated cells. A summary of the interesting gene subset is attached as a supplementary table (including the pairwise compared normalized data).In summary, these data suggest a synergism and cross-talk between the two costimulatory pathways mediated by anti-CD28/CD28 and IL-2/IL-2 receptor, respectively.Keywords: Human naive T cells, activation, costimulation, anti-CD28, IL-2, signal transduction, tumor vaccine, immunocytokine. A complete and exhaustive experimental design is given in the \"Sample description\" section of each sample.In total, seven samples were analyzed in parallel: one reference sample (d0-S1_280705: freshly isolated, purified naive T cells), two samples of fully activated naive T cells (d7-S2_280705: anti-CD3/anti-CD28 activation; d7-S3_280705: anti-CD3/IL-2 activation) and four control samples (d7-S4_280705: anti-CD3 alone; d7-S5_280705: anti-CD28 alone; d7-S6_280705: IL-2 alone; d7-S7_280705: vaccine cells alone).",

    "text": "Longitudinal Blood Transcriptomic Changes Predict Lung Function Decline in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. The Rationale: Molecular markers of disease activity that are predictive of forced vital capacity (FVC) progression in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are needed.Objectives: Develop a predictor using longitudinal within-patient gene expression differences (DGE) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to predict of FVC progression.Methods: Patients in the training cohort (n=74) experiencing >=10% relative reduction in FVC% of predicted over 12 months were categorized as progressors in contrast to the remaining stable patients. Baseline to 4-month within-patient DGE were correlated with FVC status. FVC-predictor genes were prioritized by two-group comparison with FDR<5%, logistic LASSO regression with p<0.05, and 10-Fold Cross-Validation with >=50% support. Receiver operating characteristic with area under the curve (AUC) analyses were conducted in training subsets and independent validation cohorts from UChicago (n=27), UPMC (n=35), and Imperial (n=24) where different transcriptome assay platforms and varying transcriptome sampling times were used to derive DGE.Results: Intra-subject Compared to cross-sectional analysis of baseline GE, our longitudinal DGE variation approach demonstratedlargely reduced within-group sample variation and increased statistic power fin progressor and stable groups for prediction model development. A 25-gene FVC-predictor separated \"progressors\" from \"stable\" by Principal Component Analysis in the training and subsets of the training cohort. The resulting FVC-predictor consistently demonstrated high discriminatory performance independent of transcriptome assay platforms and varying sampling times in validation cohorts (AUC= 0.77-0.80). TGF beta was the highest-ranking canonical pathway by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.Conclusions: Our novel short-term longitudinal within-patient DGE approach identified a FVC-predictor which may reflect disease activity and prove to be a reliable biomarker predictive of future FVC decline. Subjects included in this analysis were participants in COMET-IPF (Correlating Outcomes with biochemical Markers to Estimate Time-progression in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), a prospective, observational study correlating biomarkers with disease progression (NCT01071707) (E1). This multicenter investigation recruited subjects at nine clinical centers in the US. Inclusion criteria required diagnosis of IPF was confirmed using a multidisciplinary diagnostic approach per international guidelines using expertise from clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists at the local, enrolling clinical center and age 35-80 years. Subjects were excluded if the diagnosis of IPF was >4 years prior to screening or if there was a diagnosis of collagen-vascular disorder, FEV1/FVC <0.60, evidence of active infection at screening, or comorbid conditions other than IPF likely to result in death within one year. Subjects underwent protocol-directed visits every 4 months after the baseline (0 visit) for a minimum of 1 year, establishing four transcriptome sampling timepoints. Registry patients with PBMC gene expression (GE) sampling and pulmonary function tests (PFT) over at least two time points were included in each cohort. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study protocol was reviewed by the institutional review board of each participating center.",

PURPOSE: Validated biomarkers predictive of response/resistance to anthracyclines in breast cancer are currently lacking. The neoadjuvant TOP trial, in which patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors were treated with anthracycline (epirubicin) monotherapy, was specifically designed to evaluate the predictive value of topoisomerase IIa (TOP2A) and to develop a gene expression signature to identify those patients who do not benefit from anthracyclines. METHODS: The TOP trial included 149 patients, of which 141 were evaluable for response prediction analyses. The primary endpoint was pathological complete response (pCR). TOP2A and gene expression profiles were evaluated using pre-epirubicin biopsies. Gene expression data from ER-negative samples of the EORTC 10994/BIG 00-01 and MDACC 2003-0321 neoadjuvant trials were used for validation purposes.RESULTS: A pCR was obtained in 14% of the evaluable TOP patients. TOP2A amplification, but not protein overexpression, was significantly associated with pCR (p=0.001 and 0.22). We developed an \"anthracycline-based score (A-Score)\" that combines three signatures: a TOP2A gene signature and two previously published signatures related to tumor invasion and immune response. The A-Score was characterized by a high negative predictive value (NPV=0.98 [95% CI: 0.90-1.00]) overall, and in the HER2-negative and HER2-positive subpopulations. Its performance was independently confirmed in the anthracycline-based (FAC/FEC) arms of the two validation trials (BIG 00-01: 0.80 [0.61-0.92] and MDACC 2003-0321: 1.00 [0.80-1.00]).CONCLUSION: Given its high NPV, the A-Score could become, if further validated, a useful clinical tool to identify those patients who do not benefit from anthracyclines and could therefore be spared the non-negligible side effects.

Full title: Genomics based analysis of interactions between developing B-lymphocytes and stromal cells reveal complex interactions and two-way communicationIn order to identify extra cellular signals that promote B lymphocyte development we created a database with approximately 400 receptor ligand pairs and software matching gene expression data from two cell populations to obtain information about possible communication pathways. Using this database and gene expression data from NIH3T3 cells (unable to support B cell development) and OP-9 cells (strongly supportive of B cell development) and data from pro-B and pre-B cells as well as mature peripheral B-lineage cells, we were able to identify a set of potential stage and stromal cell restricted communication pathways. Functional analysis of some of these potential ways of communication allowed us to identify BMP-4 as a potent stimulator of B-cell development in vitro. Further, the analysis suggested that there existed possibilities for progenitor B cells to send signals to the stroma. The functional consequences of this were investigated by co-culture experiments revealing that the co-incubation of stromal cells with pro-B cells altered both the morphology and the gene expression pattern in the stromal cells.

Besides prominent signatures of T-cell activation and prevalent clonal variants, we also identified novel hot-spots for CN variability, fusion molecules, alternative transcripts, and progression-associated dynamics.

    "text": "Gene expression in whole lung and pulmonary macrophages reflects the dynamic pathology associated with airway surface dehydration. Scnn1b-Tg mice overexpress the beta subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (Scnn1b) in airway Club cells. The general phenotype of these mice is described in three published manuscripts (Mall et al. 2004, Nature Medicine, 10(5):487-93; Mall et al. 2008, Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 177(7):730-42; and Livraghi-Butrico et al. 2012, Physiol. Genomics 44(8):470-84. Briefly, overexpression of the Scnn1b transgene in airway Club cells leads to hyperabsorption of sodium from the airway surface liquid, dehydrated airway surface liquid and mucus, and reduced mucus clearance associated with accumulation of mucus plugs/plaques. The data provided here represents mRNA expression data from disseccted whole trachea (distal and proximal ends cut 3-4 cartliage rings below the larynx and just above the bifurcation, respectively) from male WT and Scnn1b-Tg littermates (C57Bl/6NTac background) at 4 time points [postnatal days (PND) 0, 3, 10, and 42]. PND 0 trachea are histologically normal, a tracheal mucus plug/obstruction develops around PND 3, the plug is receding to more distal airways by PND 10, and the trachea is again histologically normal by PND 42. The data from the WT mice provides a global look at mRNA changes across time, while the data from the Scnn1b-Tg line provides mRNA data that allows differential gene expression due to mucus obstruction to be queried.The data presented for the purified is part of a larger body of work evaluating gene expression in whole lung, trachea, and purified macrophages. 30 total macrophage samples were analyzed; three from each timepoint (postnatal day 0, 3, 10, and 42) for both wildtype and Scnn1b-transgenic mice grown in specific-pathogen-free facilities and from postnatal day 42 wildtype and Scnn1b-transgenic mice maintained in a germ-free facility. In our manuscript, we were most interested in changes between WT and Scnn1b-Tg mice, however, the data can also be used to evaluate changes in gene expression across time (postnatal day 0, 3, 10, and 42). This data can also be used to evaluate the differences in macrophage biology at postnatal day 42 when mice are grown in specific-pathogen-free versus germ-free environments.",

The expression of 196 genes was found to be influenced, with the majority of gene expression being decreased or silenced. Dramatic changes in the gene expression of methyltransferases during gonadal sex determination were observed in the F1 and F2 vinclozolin generation (E16) embryonic testis, but the majority returned to control-generation levels by the F3 generation. The most dramatic effects were on the germ-line-associated Dnmt3A and Dnmt3L isoforms.

    "text": "Expression data in TDEC obtained from irradiated GBM stem cell. Glioblastomas (GBM) are brain tumors which display a bad prognosis despite conventional treatment associating surgical resection and subsequent radio-chemotherapy. These tumors are defined by an abundant and abnormal vascularization as well as by an important cellular heterogeneity. GBM notably contain a subpopulation of GBM stem-like cells (GSC) which contribute to tumor aggressiveness, resistance, and recurrence. Moreover, GSC directly take part in the formation of new vessels via their transdifferentiation into tumor derived endothelial cells (TDEC). Considering the importance of the vascularization in the GBM, we postulate that radiation could enhance the transdifferentiation of GSC into TDEC. Here, we show that ionizing radiation potentiates endothelial features of TDEC obtained from 3 patient-derived primocultures of GSC. Indeed, TDEC obtained from irradiated GSC (TDEC IR+) migrate more towards VEGF, form more pseudotubes in Matrigel in vitro and develop more functional blood vessel in Matrigel plugs implanted in Nude mice than TDEC obtained from non-irradiated GSC. Transcriptomic analysis allows us to highlight an overexpression of Tie2 in TDEC IR+ which is associated with the activation of AKT signaling pathway. All radiation-induced effects on TDEC IR+ were abolished by using a Tie2 kinase inhibitor, confirming the role of Tie2 signaling pathway in this process. Finally, the number of Tie2+ vessels is increased in recurrent GBM compared with matched untreated tumors. In conclusion, we show that irradiation potentiates proangiogenic features of TDEC throught Tie2/AKT signaling pathway. New therapeutic stategies associating standard teatment and an inhibitor of Tie2 signaling pathway should be considered for forthcoming trials. 12 samples were analyzed: 3 replicates of 4 different condition: GBM stem cells (GSC) (line SRC3), GBM differentiated cells (GDC) obtained from SRC3 GSC and Tumor Derived endothelial cells (TDEC) obtained from irradiated or not SRC3 GSC.",

Susceptibility genes for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), monogenetic disorders with intellectual disabilities (ID) or schizophrenia (SCZ) converge on processes related to neuronal function and differentiation. Furthermore, ASD risk genes are enriched for FMRP (Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein) targets and for genes implicated in ID. In addition, a significant co-heritability was observed between ASD and SCZ. The genetic overlap between ASD, FXS, ID and SCZ together with the symptomatic differences gives rise to the question if pathomechanisms impair the same or different regulatory patterns activated during neuronal differentiation (ND). To test this idea, we performed transcriptome analysis of in-vitro differentiation of the neuroblastoma cell line model SH-SY5Y and identified genes that were differentially expressed, dynamically regulated, and coordinately expressed. The identified genetic modules activated during ND are enriched for genetic risk factors for these four disorders. Although risk genes for the disorders significantly overlap, we observed disorder specific enrichments: ASD or FXS implicated genes were likely to be positive regulators of ND whereas ID implicated genes were related to negative regulation. ASD and SCZ genes were specifically enriched among cholesterol and fatty acid associated modules. ID genes were overrepresented among cell cycle modules. In addition, we show that ASD genes are likely to be hub genes. We hypothesize that knowledge about genetic variants of an individual combined with network and pathway context of the related genes will allow differentiating between psychiatric disorders. 21 samples, consisting of 3 replicates harvested at 7 different time-points of RA+BDNF-induced neuronal differentiation.",

MicroRNA (miRNA) is a type of non-coding RNA that regulates the expression of its target genes by interacting with the complementary sequence of the target mRNA molecules. Recent evidence has shown that genotoxic stress induces miRNA expression, but the target genes involved and role in cellular responses remain unclear. We examined the role of miRNA in the cellular response to X-ray irradiation by studying the expression profiles of radio-responsive miRNAs and their target genes in cultured human cell lines. We found that expression of miR-574-3p was induced in the lung cancer cell line A549 by X-ray irradiation. Overexpression of miR-574-3p caused delayed growth in A549 cells. A predicted target site was detected in the 3'-untranslated region of the enhancer of the rudimentary homolog (ERH) gene, and transfected cells showed an interaction between the luciferase reporter containing the target sequences and miR-574-3p. Overexpression of miR-574-3p suppressed ERH protein production and delayed cell growth. This delay was confirmed by knockdown of ERH expression. Our study suggests that miR-574-3p may contribute to the regulation of the cell cycle in response to X-ray irradiation via suppression of ERH protein production.This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

In telomerase-positive human cancer cells, however, telomeres are often kept shorter than the surrounding normal tissues. Recently, we have shown that telomere elongation in cancer cells represses innate immune genes and promotes their differentiation in vivo. This implies that short telomeres contribute to cancer malignancy, but it is unclear how such genetic repression is caused by long telomeres. Here we report that telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) induces genome-wide alteration of gene expression in telomere-elongated cancer cells in vivo. Using three different cell lines, we found that telomere elongation upregulates TERRA and downregulates innate immune genes in vivo xenograft tumors. Most of the suppressed genes belonged to innate immune system categories and were upregulated in various cancers. We propose that TERRA G4 counteracts cancer malignancy through suppression of innate immune genes.

    "text": "TRAIL Is a Novel Antiviral Protein against Dengue Virus. Dengue fever is an important tropical illness for which there is currently no virus-specific treatment. To shed light on mechanisms involved in the cellular response to dengue virus (DV), we assessed gene expression changes, using Affymetrix GeneChips (HG-U133A), of infected primary human cells and identified changes common to all cells. The common response genes included a set of 23 genes significantly induced upon DV infection of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes, and B cells (analysis of variance, P < 0.05). Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), one of the common response genes, was identified as a key link between type I and type II interferon response genes. We found that DV induces TRAIL expression in immune cells and HUVECs at the mRNA and protein levels. The induction of TRAIL expression by DV was found to be dependent on an intact type I interferon signaling pathway. A significant increase in DV RNA accumulation was observed in anti-TRAIL antibody-treated monocytes, B cells, and HUVECs, and, conversely, a decrease in DV RNA was seen in recombinant TRAIL-treated monocytes. Furthermore, recombinant TRAIL inhibited DV titers in DV-infected DCs by an apoptosis-independent mechanism. These data suggest that TRAIL plays an important role in the antiviral response to DV infection and is a candidate for antiviral interventions against DV.We used Affymetrix microarrays to study the response of human host cells to dengue virus (DV).Keywords: virus infection of multiple cell types. For three human cell types, RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. We compared a total of 10 samples. Five were infected in vitro for 48 hours with DV, including HUVECs (n=2), monocytes (n=2), and B-cells (n=1). Five were mock-infected controls of the same cell types and numbers. From these samples, were identified 23 genes that were induced by DV infection in all of the cell types.",

Analysis of transcript abundance estimates as a function of child soldier status, PTSD symptoms, and psychological resilience. Gene expression profiling was conducted on dried blood spot (DBS) samples collected from community dwelling adolescents and young adults in Nepal. Approximatley half of the sample were former child soldiers in the Nepal People's War and the other half were demographically similiar civilian non-combatants. In addition to basic demographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnic minority status, social caste status, education level), participants were also assessed on syptoms of post-traumatic stress (PTS, assessed by a culturally adapted version of The Child PTSD Symptom Scale; Kohrt BA, et al. (2011) Validation of cross-cultural child mental health and psychosocial research instruments: adapting the Depression Self-Rating Scale and Child PTSD Symptom Scale in Nepal.

    "text": "Cisplatin treated melanoma and melanocyte cell lines. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) orchestrates the repair of helix distorting DNA damage, induced by both ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and cisplatin. There is evidence that the global genome repair (GGR) arm of NER is dysfunctional in melanoma and it is known to have limited induction in melanoma cell lines after cisplatin treatment. The aims of this study were to examine mRNA transcript levels of regulators of GGR and to investigate the downstream effect on global transcript expression in melanoma cell lines after cisplatin treatment and in melanoma tumours. One melanocyte, three primary melanoma (MM200, IgR3, Me4405) and two metastatic melanoma (Mel-RM and Sk-mel-28) cell lines were treated with cispltain and gene expression profile data collected at 0, 6 and 24 hours. Biological duplicates were treated and RNA was collected for each cell line at each timepoint. The duplicated were run sperately on the WGGEX beadarrays and the results of the duplicates averaged for publication. The transcript expression results were cubic spline normalised using BeadStudio 2.0 software (Illumina, USA), and the remaining analyses was performed using GeneSpring GX 11.0. To account for bias or skewing of expression results all the gene expression profiles and each individual gene were normalized to the median resulting in two way normalisation. For visualisation of the results the data was log transformed.",

    "text": "The stem cell gene ABCB5 mediates cancer resistance to apoptosis. Cancer stem cells (CSC) responsible for disease progression and therapeutic resistance have been identified in several human malignancies, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the molecular mechanisms through which CSC drive tumor growth are incompletely understood. ABCB5, a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of active transporters, serves as a CSC-specific multidrug resistance mechanism in diverse human malignancies. Additionally, ABCB5 has recently been demonstrated to function as an anti-apoptotic gene in tissue-specific non-malignant stem cells. Here we demonstrate that ABCB5 also serves an anti-apoptotic role required for CSC maintenance in human cancer. Targeted inhibition of ABCB5, previously shown to be preferentially expressed on CD133-positive CRC stem cells, induced tumor cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo and inhibited human CRC growth in NSG recipient mice. Mechanistically, ABCB5-positive tumor cell ablation through monoclonal antibody-mediated blockade or shRNA-mediated gene knockdown resulted in diminished production of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, a pro-tumorigenic molecule identified herein to be preferentially produced by CRC stem cells. Restoration of AXL expression through gene transfection in ABCB5 knockdown tumors partially restored tumor growth, demonstrating that ABCB5-positive CRC stem cells drive tumorigenicity at least in part through production of AXL. Our results establish a novel anti-apoptotic function of ABCB5 in human cancer and indicate that targeted blockade of ABCB5 represents a novel strategy for CSC eradication, independent of its previously established function as a multidrug resistance mediator. ABCB5-positive cells and ABCB5-negative cell populations were isolated by FACS cell sorting using anti-ABCB5 mAb as described (Ksander et al., Nature, 2014). Microarray analyses were performed on purified ABCB5+ (n=4) and ABCB5- (n=4) cell subsets derived from the established colon cancer cell lines COLO741, SW480, HT29 and HCT116. Total RNA isolated from sorted cell populations was processed and hybridized onto Human Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix) .",
